              "   Union <b> pilots </b> who struck Eastern Airlines are entitled to replace trainees hired to help the carrier rebuild, a federal judge said. Thursday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis apparently affects only those who were in training when time the <b> pilots </b> ended their walkout, said E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. Still, Breen said, ``It's clearly a major victory.'' All but 200 of the 3,600 <b> union </b> <b> pilots </b> walked off the job in sympathy with Machinists who struck the Miami-based <b> airline </b> in March 1989. Pilots ended their sympathy walkout in November, but fewer than 50 have been called back to Eastern, <b> pilots </b> association officials say. The Machinists are still striking. At least 404 <b> pilots </b> were in training when the <b> pilots </b> returned to work, the <b> pilots </b> association says. The <b> airline </b> estimates only 180 jobs are affected by the ruling, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. Further hearings likely will be determine the exact number of affected jobs, Breen said. Eastern said in a statement it would appeal the decision. The <b> airline </b> predicted the ruling wouldn't immediately affect current <b> employees </b> or operations. Many <b> pilots </b> took jobs with other <b> airlines </b> after the strike began March 4, 1989, but about 1,400 former Eastern <b> pilots </b> may still be interested in returning, pilots' association spokesman Lou Baldwin said. Davis' ruling stems from the association's challenge of Eastern's claim that the formerly striking <b> pilots </b> were not needed. Davis agreed that the federal Railway Labor Act guarantees returning strikers job rights ahead of newly hired trainees. Davis said Eastern violated the Railway Labor Act by hiring pilot trainees not already qualified to fly regular flights. The act was devised to provide ``uninterrupted transportation service,'' the ruling said. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike began. It presently operates about 800 flights, down from its pre-strike <b> service </b> of 1,040. Ms. Ceremsak said she does not believe Davis' ruling must receive bankruptcy court approval. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, all returning <b> pilots </b> would need to go through several weeks of recertification training under the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern officials said. Eastern currently has about 1,900 pilots, including those trained before the strike was settled, <b> pilots </b> hired from other <b> airlines </b> and <b> union </b> <b> pilots </b> who later crossed picket lines. Baldwin said the Eastern <b> pilots </b> trainees' annual pay is about $27,000. The average pre-strike pay at Eastern for fully accredited <b> pilots </b> was about $65,000, he said. </p> 0.429109398698947  \n",
              "   The chairman of Texas Air Corp. Friday defended a decision by the company's subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, to lay off 4,000 <b> employees </b> and cut <b> service </b> as a way to ``stabilize the company'' by cutting losses. Frank Lorenzo, testifying at a federal court hearing on Eastern's plans to eliminate <b> service </b> to 14 cities, said the layoffs and schedule changes were a necessary step to save the financially troubled carrier. ``If Eastern's management is not permitted to take the actions to save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,'' Lorenzo said, rejecting suggestions by <b> union </b> attorneys that he was trying to bust organized <b> labor </b> at Eastern by transferring the carrier's assets to Continental Airlines, another Texas Air property. Three <b> labor </b> <b> unions </b> that represent Eastern <b> employees </b> have challenged the plans and obtained a temporary restraining order that bars the <b> airline </b> from making layoffs. U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker is holding hearings on the union's bid for a permanent injunction. Lorenzo defended the proposed cutbacks ``as an attempt to stabilize the company ... and decrease the losses.'' Eastern currently is in federally supervised contract negotiations with two of its unions, the Association of Air Line Pilots and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Lorenzo denied suggestions that Texas Air planned to merge Eastern's operations into Continental. Union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that Lorenzo was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air had purchased Eastern. The draft said that the purchase of Eastern gave Texas Air leverage over the unions. ``Eastern's airplanes can be repainted and moved over to Continental where they will be flown by non-union pilots,'' the speech draft said. But Lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking firm. It was unclear from the testimony if Lorenzo ever delivered that portion of the speech. </p> 0.40322963681166  \n",
              "   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it has canceled its contract with Orion Air Inc. to provide strike-replacement pilots, but pledged to remain flying in the event of <b> labor </b> troubles. Eastern, preparing for tough negotiations with the Machinists <b> union </b> on its expiring <b> labor </b> pact, had contracted with Orion in case its own <b> pilots </b> refused to cross picket lines, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. But U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington ruled in March that the deal with Orion violated the existing contract between Eastern and its <b> pilots </b> union. Replacements cannot be trained until a strike begins, the judge said. Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., is one of the largest U.S. operators of aircraft for the small package industry. Miami-based Eastern, the nation's sixth-largest airline, is a subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp. The Transport Workers Union filed a similar suit in April, accusing Eastern of using its planes to train Orion <b> flight </b> attendants to break a strike. Ms. Ceremsak refused to attribute the cancellation of the Orion contract to Eastern's legal setbacks, however. The contract was terminated ``for sound business reasons,'' said Ms. Ceremsak. ``Beyond that I can't elaborate.'' The decision to end the contract does not mean that financially troubled Eastern will shut down if the Machinists walk out, the spokeswoman said. ``We do have plans to operate in case of a strike,'' she said. ``But our first priority is still reaching a settlement'' with the Machinists. J.B. Stokes, a spokesman for the <b> pilots </b> <b> union </b> at Eastern, said the federal court decisions against Eastern left the carrier with no choice. ``This is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey court orders,'' said Stokes. ``The judge said you cannot train (replacement) <b> pilots </b> in any capacity until such time as there is a strike.'' The cancellation will cost Eastern about $5.5 million under a provision of the Orion contract, Stokes said. Ms. Ceremsak refused to comment on any provisions of the contract or its cancellation. </p> 0.386984049004294  \n",
              "   The obscure cargo <b> airline </b> that Eastern Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces questions about its safety record as the government decides whether it is fit to carry passengers. Few <b> air </b> travelers have ever heard of Orion Air, a North Carolina cargo carrier which serves such <b> air </b> freight companies as United Parcel Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator. But if <b> labor </b> strife intensifies at Eastern, many of that airline's customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion _ and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up scrutiny of the airline. Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion, including the leasing of 26 of Eastern's jetliners, that call on the <b> airline </b> to take over much of Eastern's routes if <b> pilots </b> and mechanics go on strike. Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own <b> pilots </b> and ground workers, Eastern officials said. But the FAA has yet to approve Orion for passenger service, and a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against Orion because of past safety violations. An FAA inspection report on Orion shows ``a large number of serious safety infractions,'' said Anthony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for aviation standards. Broderick said the airline's management has taken actions ``to permit Orion to safely operate its cargo business'' and training and maintenance procedures ``are being corrected to prevent similar occurrences in the future.'' At congressional hearings Tuesday, James L. Heffernan, an Orion vice president, said problems cited by the FAA have been corrected. Heffernan called Orion's safety record excellent and maintained that much of the FAA's concerns stemmed from a ``misunderstanding'' by FAA inspectors about Orion's method of record keeping. ``Orion Air responded to each of the FAA's proposed findings last summer and are still in the process of resolving these issues. Obviously, if any of the issues compromised <b> air </b> safety, the FAA would not have allowed Orion Air to continue to operate,'' Heffernan continued. But Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairman of the House government operations and transportation subcommittee, called Orion ``an <b> airline </b> in near-shambles'' and raised questions about its fitness to fly passengers. In an interview, Steven Kolski, a vice president of Eastern, said Eastern executives believe Orion's past safety problems have been resolved. He expressed confidence that the airline's fitness will be assured before the FAA allows it to engage in passenger-carrying flights. ``We got a report that said they (Orion) are a hell of a lot better today than they were a year ago and that most, if not all, of their problems were behind them and they were in good shape,'' said Kolski. Kolski said Eastern is relying on the agreement with Orion to keep Eastern's <b> service </b> going if its 10,000 mechanics go on strike and its 4,000 <b> pilots </b> refuse to cross the picket lines. But FAA officials were not as certain that all of Orion's safety shortcomings are behind it. The FAA cited ``systemic difficulties'' with the airline's training program, record keeping and use of operational handbooks that are not yet corrected. And the agency disclosed it was seeking civil penalties against Orion for past violations, although no amounts were cited. ``Once the systemic problems have all been corrected, the FAA will turn its attention toward developing an appropriate enforcement package, including a proposed fine'' for past violations, Broderick said. Orion's problems stem from safety violations found in early 1987 _ violations that attracted little public attention because Orion's 55 jets were carrying only cargo. Among the findings by FAA inspectors were a shortage of required training records; inadequate auditing of maintenance facilites; poor documentation on the qualifications of ``check pilots'' who decide on the performance of line pilots; incomplete <b> flight </b> operations manuals, instances of <b> pilots </b> failing to go through required refresher training; and training programs that did not meet federal standards. In a related development Tuesday, the FAA made public a report on improvements Eastern Airlines has made in its own maintenance program since the <b> airline </b> was fined a record $9.5 million two years ago. The FAA said that Eastern has made ``substantial progress'' to correct past deficiencies, but that some concerns remain about the airline's deferred maintenance program and repeated problems with certain equipment. Nevertheless, Eastern officials hailed the latest FAA findings which showed that corrective actions had been taken in 52 of the 53 areas cited by the FAA two years ago. ``We are very pleased. This report shows that Eastern has corrected the deficiencies,'' said Kolski. </p> 0.34912563695709  \n",

And as ``a token of our thanks,'' Warren said, two free round-trip tickets in first-class seating would be given to <b> flight </b> attendants who report as scheduled between Dec. 15 and Jan. 1. Northwest employs more than 8,000 <b> flight </b> attendants. To qualify, workers must be scheduled for flights on Dec. 24, Dec. 25, Dec. 31 or Jan. 1. Service charges that normally accompany worker flight-pass privileges would be waived. Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said that last year, <b> flight </b> attendants were offered a $100 cash bonus for working through the holidays. Miller said the offer does not reflect a problem with holiday sick leave in the ranks of <b> flight </b> attendants. ``It's just that when we're in crunch time like we are around the holidays, every single person is key to our success,'' he said. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Loma Linda Medical Center said Friday has accepted a fourth baby born with most of his brain missing and will keep it alive for up to a week in hopes that its organs can be used for transplant. The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified Southern California <b> hospital </b> Thursday and transferred to Loma Linda University Medical Center, said Anita Rockwell, a spokeswoman for the center. Baby D suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is missing. The <b> condition </b> almost always leads to death within days or weeks. ``His parents want to donate their baby's organs when brain death occurs,'' Rockwell said. Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda chief of neonatology, said Baby D was resting comfortably Friday and receiving nutrition and water as needed. Rockwell said the newborn will be cared for for a seven-day period that began Thursday night. Under Loma Linda policy, Baby D will be placed on <b> life </b> support if needed to prevent damage to organs. If Baby D is declared brain-dead within seven days, the <b> hospital </b> will give notice that his organs are available for transplant. If he isn't brain dead within seven days, he will be allowed to die. The time limit was developed to alleviate ethical concerns that doomed anencephalics not be kept alive indefinitely merely so their organs can be donated. Rockwell said anonymity was requested by Baby D's parents and officials of the <b> hospital </b> where he was born. Baby D is the fourth anencephalic newborn accepted as a possible organ donor at the hospital. The first was stillborn Dec. 23, thwarting her parents' desire to have her major organs donated. Her corneas and <b> heart </b> valves were given to infants needing them. The second anencephalic was declared brain-dead Feb. 18. Attempts to donate his liver failed because potential recipients either weren't suitable matches or couldn't be operated on in time. He was disconnected from life-support Feb. 20. Most recently, a girl was transferred to Loma Linda after birth Feb. 20. Because she never met brain-death criteria within the seven-day limit, she was disconnected from a respirator and allowed to die on Feb. 28. However, her eyes, corneas and <b> heart </b> valves were later donated to infants needing organs. Loma Linda gained worldwide attention in 1984 when Dr. Leonard Bailey, frustrated at the lack of <b> heart </b> donors for babies, transplanted a baboon's <b> heart </b> into a girl known as Baby Fae. She <b> died </b> 20{ days later. Bailey, whose baboon transplant was sharply criticized by many doctors, subsequently urged the use of anencephalics as donors of hearts and other organs. </p> 0.53641965260323  \n",
              "   Police on Friday sought a 12-year-old girl needing <b> heart </b> <b> surgery </b> and her mother, who authorities said abducted the girl from a <b> hospital </b> because the woman's religion forbids blood transfusions. The girl, Kimberly Winfield, was believed to have left Children's Memorial Hospital about 1 a.m. Thursday, said police Lt. Edmund Beazley. The mother, Caroline Winfield, called relatives to say she wanted to return her daughter, said Dave Schneidman, spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. But she was afraid to surrender for fear of being prosecuted. Police obtained an arrest warrant for the 35-year-old <b> mother </b> on a charge of <b> child </b> abduction because Kimberly is a ward of the state, Beazley said. ``We're not real interested in catching the <b> mother </b> if she doesn't want to be caught, but we do want the <b> child </b> back so we can save the child's life,'' Schneidman said. Police and the state Department of Children and Family Services said they were reasonably certain the <b> mother </b> was responsible for the child's disappearance. ``There doesn't seem to be any doubt of it right now,'' Beazley said. ``Before the <b> child </b> was discovered missing, the <b> mother </b> had told relatives that she was going to take the <b> child </b> from the <b> hospital </b> because she did not approve of the surgery,'' said department spokesman Schneidman. Schneidman said the <b> child </b> needed open-heart <b> surgery </b> to survive. ``The prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live without the surgery,'' he said. However, Children's Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Jan Benzies said Kimberly, who was admitted Wednesday, was not critically ill. ``She was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her <b> heart </b> problem,'' the spokeswoman said. ``Her doctor does not believe her <b> life </b> is in immediate danger. ``However, it is clinically advisable that she be located and treated within a month,'' she said. No one at the <b> hospital </b> saw the <b> mother </b> or <b> child </b> leave, Beazley said. ``Apparently, she just got her dressed and walked out,'' he said. ``They were allowing the <b> mother </b> to stay in the room with her, which is pretty common with young children. The nurse came back to check on them and they were both gone.'' The <b> mother </b> is a Jehovah's Witness, Beazley said. Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against the teachings of the Bible. ``You can't do <b> surgery </b> without a transfusion of blood,'' Schneidman said. The Department of Children and Family Services waited about 34 hours after the disappearance to notify the press so police could check leads on Winfield's whereabouts, Schneidman said. Those leads were exhausted, he said. The agency was named temporary custodian of Kimberly and two brothers, ages 2 and 8, about a month ago because Winfield was unable to care for them, Schneidman said. ``They were living on the streets without proper housing or any evident means of support,'' Schneidman said. The boys, whose names were not released, are now living with their paternal grandmother in Chicago, Beazley said. A department caseworker noticed Kimberly was ill and took her to the hospital, Schneidman said. Larry Winfield, Kimberly's father, had been notified and was very concerned, Schneidman said. He maintains a permanent residence and is employed, but the <b> mother </b> and <b> children </b> have not lived with him for some time, Schneidman said. </p> 0.451325934329735  \n",

Valley View Hospital, where Mrs. Kesler had delivered six of her most recent children, provided its services free when she went there for her 12th.

On March 9, Day suffered a head injury in a fall at his Bel Air home, and underwent emergency treatment to relieve the pressure caused by bleeding in the brain. He remained in the <b> hospital </b> until April 12, Markarian said. Day appeared regularly with comedian Jack Benny on radio and television as well as in films.

              "   When Ron Thompson sat down for lunch on New Year's Eve, he was the grandfather of five. At breakfast Monday, he was a grandfather of nine. Three of Thompson's daughters _ Mary Tolson, Joan Thompson and Carol Thompson _ gave birth to four boys at Seton Medical Center late Sunday and early Monday. When Ms. Tolson went into labor Sunday, she asked her 19-year-old sister Joan, who was in the ninth month of her pregnancy, to drive her to the hospital. After about five hours, Ms. Tolson, 28, gave birth at 2:40 p.m. to Shane Taylor Tolson, who weighed 7 pounds 9 ounces. At Ms. Tolson's delivery, Dr. Chris Seeker said Joan told him, ``You will probably be seeing me, too.'' Sure enough, seven hours later Joan was hustled to Seton by sister Carol. Joan gave birth to Jeremy Andrew Thompson Armendariz at 12:01 a.m. He weighed 6 pounds 10 ounces. Carol, 24, then went into labor and gave birth to twin boys just before 3 a.m. The mothers and four boys spent New Year's Day in good condition. ``This beats partying,'' Joan said. ``At least I have a (sense of) relief and not a headache.'' </p> </details> \n",

              "   Disruptive <b> children </b> can cause <b> parents </b> to drink more, a Florida State University study released Friday shows. ``I'm not suggesting we blame <b> children </b> for the alcoholism of their parents, because those who grow up in alcoholic <b> homes </b> have suffered enough already,'' said Dr. Alan Lang, an associate professor of psychology at Florida State. ``Nonetheless, particularly difficult <b> children </b> can cause distress for <b> parents </b> and, in some cases, this may contribute to increased alcohol use.'' Contrary to the teachings of self-help groups, who place the onus on <b> parents </b> and tell <b> children </b> of alcoholics they aren't to blame, the Florida State study may provide the first documented evidence that <b> children </b> actually can cause their <b> parents </b> to drink more. Lang teamed with Dr. William Pelham of the University of Pittsburgh to conduct the research. ``Our studies show how the destructive role of alcohol in parent-child interactions is a two-way street,'' Lang said. ``Problem drinkers make <b> poor </b> parents, but problem <b> children </b> may also drive <b> parents </b> to drink.'' He said the findings are similar to those of studies that show <b> children </b> who are mentally retarded or have serious behavioral problems are abused more often than normal, obedient children. ``The point is that while we usually think of <b> parents </b> as influencers of children, <b> children </b> can affect <b> parents </b> as well,'' Lang said. ``And the outcome is not always favorable.'' Dr. Robin Room, scientific director of the Alchohol Research Group of the Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, wasn't surprised by the findings but said it was important to look into the cause of drinking among parents, ``rather than give in to the bumper sticker-type humor that says <b> children </b> cause their <b> parents </b> to drink. ``It's important to understand that parental drinking patterns can later influence their children's drinking patterns,'' Room said. The Florida researchers, under a grant from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked 120 <b> parents </b> with 5-to-12-year-old sons to interact with an unfamiliar boy of a similar age. The <b> parents </b> were then given an opportunity to drink as much or as little alcohol as they wanted, while anticipating a second interaction with the same child. Half of the <b> parents </b> in the study had difficult <b> children </b> of their own with short attention spans, hyperactivity, conduct disorders, or some combination of the three. The other half had only <b> children </b> without behavior disorders. But the researchers stacked the deck. Half the <b> parents </b> had initially interacted with boys who behaved normally, while half had faced boys trained by the researchers to behave in an overactive and disruptive way. Among <b> parents </b> of normal children, those who interacted with disruptive boys drank one-third more than those who interacted with a cooperative child. ``I feel justified in suggesting that these results indicate that drinking is a parental behavior that can be influenced by the characteristics and behaviors of children,'' Lang said. Parents with disruptive <b> children </b> at <b> home </b> responded differently to the study, however, depending on the drinking patterns of their own parents. Those who had a <b> family </b> history of drinking problems drank 50 percent more after interacting with a deviant child-actor, while those with no such <b> family </b> history drank less. ``This suggests that <b> people </b> differ in their vulnerability to increased drinking in response to the stress of interactions with a difficult child,'' Lang said. </p> 0.488623675412384  \n",
              "   Overweight <b> children </b> have greater long-term success controlling their weight if their <b> parents </b> provide early support for exercising and eating right, researchers said. Ten years after participating in a weight-loss program as 6- to 12-year-olds, <b> children </b> whose <b> parents </b> got similar weight-control training were significantly less obese than those whose <b> parents </b> received less training, according to a study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. ``We think the important finding is in the modeling,'' said psychologist Leonard H. Epstein, head of the University of Pittsburgh's Childhood Obesity Clinic and leader of the research team. ``If you have <b> children </b> who you don't want to eat potato chips, you can't sit in front of them eating Ho-Hos.'' Epstein's <b> group </b> also concluded that pre-adolescent weight loss had no effect on height development, contrary to the findings of several shorter-term studies. Two other childhood obesity experts called Epstein's results surprisin because previous research has shown that fat <b> children </b> will grow into fat adults and that weight lost in treatment programs is quickly regained. Those experts said further study was needed on whether treatment of obesity in childhood can produce effects that persist into young adulthood. In Epstein's project, an initial <b> group </b> of 75 obese <b> children </b> and their <b> parents </b> were randomly assigned to three groups. Study criteria required the <b> children </b> be more than 20 percent over ideal weight for their age, height and sex; both <b> parents </b> <b> living </b> at home, one of whom had to be obese; and one parent willing to attend treatment meetings with their child. All subjects were to attend eight weekly treatment meetings followed by six monthly meetings, then by 21-month, five-year and 10-year meetings. All were instructed to follow a regimen that included a 1,200-to-1,500-calorie-per-day diet and an aerobic exercise program. In the first group, both <b> parents </b> and <b> children </b> received reinforcement for losing weight and were trained to praise other <b> family </b> members for changing eating and exercise habits. In the second group, only the <b> children </b> received reinforcement for losing weight but were similarly trained to praise <b> family </b> members for weight-control behaviors. Parents and <b> children </b> in the third <b> group </b> received reinforcement only for attending the meetings. They received information about social reinforcement without specific training in how to use the method. All subjects lost weight initially. At the 10-year mark, the <b> children </b> in the first <b> group </b> were, on average, 7.5 percent less overweight than at the beginning of the study while those in the second and third groups were 4.5 percent and 14.3 percent fatter, respectively. Parents in all three groups were more obese after 10 years than at the start of the study. In a journal editorial, Dr. Albert J. Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania medical school and Dr. Robert I. Berkowitz of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic cautioned that the ``treatment did not prevent obesity, it limited it.'' They called Epstein's results surprising, perhaps because of his relatively small study sample: intact, middle-class <b> families </b> in which the <b> parents </b> were likely to be very supportive of their children's efforts. They said replication of Epstein's study ``is clearly needed'' before the findings can be embraced. </p> 0.444631427012752  \n",
              "   Amid the frozen farm fields of Iowa, Judy Shelly answered a cry for help from a small wooden garage. Huddled inside were a mother and three children. They'd lost almost everything _ including their home. They had blankets, beds, a few sticks of furniture and a hot plate, but no bathroom or refrigerator. No money either. Forced off their farm, abandoned by husband and father, the <b> family </b> was struggling to survive. Their predicament is a sad but increasingly common sign of hard times in the heartland. As farmers lose their land, small-town factories shut their doors and <b> housing </b> costs rise, growing numbers of <b> rural </b> folks are joining the ranks of the nation's homeless. ``Rural <b> homeless </b> <b> people </b> are everywhere around us,'' said Louisa Stark, president of the National Coalition for the Homeless. ``They're <b> living </b> in barns and chicken coops. They're doubled and tripled up with <b> families </b> and friends. They're <b> living </b> under trees or, in some cases, sleeping in caves.'' Garages, too. The Iowa <b> family </b> had rented a nearby <b> house </b> after losing their farm last winter, but when the pipes burst and the landlord couldn't afford repairs, they moved into the garage because it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater. Shelly, who works for a farmers-assistance group, helped find them a place to stay. They moved on shortly after. People think <b> rural </b> America ``has been able to stand on its own two feet ever since the Depression,'' Shelly said. ``(They think) somehow they'll get by. They think you have the white picket fence, mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids. That's not the way it is. ``The reality is <b> urban </b> life and <b> rural </b> life are not much different anymore,'' she added. ``We have <b> people </b> going without food. We have <b> people </b> going without heat.'' And <b> people </b> going without roofs over their heads. Up to 3 million Americans are homeless, the national coalition says. Some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in <b> rural </b> areas, but nobody knows for sure because they aren't as conspicious as <b> people </b> panhandling on <b> city </b> streets or sleeping on grates. ``Everybody calls the <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> invisible. In fact, they are,'' said Melanie Roth of the Housing Assistance Council in Washington, D.C., which deals with <b> rural </b> low-income <b> housing </b> needs. ``They don't wander the streets of small-town America,'' said Keith Luebke, co-director of the Welcome Inn Transitional Living Center in Mankato, Minn. ``They leave or they somehow hide themselves or hide their problems. They don't want anyone to know.'' Most of the newest <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> are working <b> poor </b> and farm families, says a report by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences. Compared with their <b> urban </b> counterparts, the report says, they're younger <b> families </b> dependent on two incomes; typically, one wage-earner loses a job and the remaining income isn't enough to pay the rent. They most often live in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled industries. These <b> people </b> face a Hobson's choice of moving in with friends or relatives _ or pulling up roots and leaving. The institute's report said some <b> rural </b> areas have a five-year waiting list for public housing. Though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities, the <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> get much less help _ fewer shelters, fewer soup kitchens, less money from charities. ``In short, the faint voice that has recently been given to the <b> homeless </b> in <b> urban </b> America has been denied the <b> homeless </b> of <b> rural </b> America,'' said a national coalition study on such problems in Appalachia and the South. Several studies have examined <b> rural </b> homelessness. Among the findings: _ More than three-quarters of community agencies responding to a Housing Assistance Council survey last year reported increases in <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> from 1981-82 to 1986-87. Of those, 38 percent said the increase was significant. _ In Ohio, the proportion of women among the <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> was twice that of <b> urban </b> <b> homeless </b> populations, according to a 1985 study. That's partly due to the higher percentage of married <b> people </b> among the <b> rural </b> homeless, 18.5 percent against 6.7 percent married among <b> urban </b> homeless. _ In Minnesota, 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional <b> living </b> centers had jobs, compared with 24 percent in <b> urban </b> Minneapolis, said a 1988 study by the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless. _ In Iowa, a study found one of the larger groups in danger of losing <b> homes </b> was farm widows, many of whom live on just a few hundred dollars a month. The count of <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> should also include <b> people </b> who live in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family, a common arrangement among down-and-out farmers, the experts say. It may be 21 <b> people </b> <b> living </b> in one house, nine <b> children </b> and three adults squeezed in a trailer or a <b> family </b> so crowded they sleep in shifts. ``You have <b> people </b> <b> living </b> on top of each other. Those are the hidden homeless,'' said Luebke. ``These <b> people </b> no longer have their own <b> home </b> or apartment. They have a roof over their head, but in real terms they should be considered homeless.'' Living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies say it's tantamount to being homeless. ``When <b> people </b> have a <b> home </b> where the roof is constantly leaking and the cold air can come in ... (and) there's no money to fix those things, that's not a home,'' said Norma Dell, director of Bethany House, a Kentucky social service center. Agencies around the country have files on <b> people </b> <b> living </b> in rat-infested shanties, rotting houses without walls or shacks without heat, water or toilets. Others describe a wheelchair-bound man <b> living </b> under a bridge after being evicted, an Indian <b> family </b> sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough, a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator. Stark said she's heard reports from California of farmworkers <b> living </b> in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves. </p> 0.408340774464199  \n",
              "   Frustration over having to draw up an unemotional report on the <b> homeless </b> and then go into streets where <b> people </b> were ``ravaging garbage cans'' prompted dissent by most of the report's authors, one of them said today. Phyllis Wolfe, executive director of a private health <b> care </b> program for the <b> homeless </b> in the nation's capital, said that while gathering information for the report, panel members became outraged at conditions they found. ``It could just not be left in dots and dashes and graphs and figures,'' Ms. Wolfe said on ``CBS This Morning.'' Ms. Wolfe joined eight other members of the committee formed by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine in issuing a supplementary statement that the institute refused to include in its report published Monday. The published report, ``Homelessness, Health and Human Needs,'' calls the growing number of <b> homeless </b> <b> children </b> ``a national disgrace.'' It recommends such measures as changing food stamp programs, increasing Medicaid services and expanding programs that help pre-school children. The authors of the supplementary statement said recommendations in the report were too limited. They said the country should supply more low-income housing, raise the minimum wage, offer more support services and guarantee <b> homeless </b> <b> people </b> adequate health care. Nine members of the 13-member panel signed the supplementary statement saying the main study ``fails to capture our sense of shame and anger about homelessness.'' The original report estimates that <b> families </b> with a total of 100,000 <b> children </b> are <b> homeless </b> on any given night, in addition to countless <b> children </b> who have run away from <b> home </b> or been kicked out by their parents. It says those under 18 are the fastest growing <b> homeless </b> group, and homelessness is increasing in many <b> rural </b> areas as well as in the nation's cities. Ms. Wolfe said the committee's work on the report was ``very structured,'' but members found themselves ``leaving committee meetings and walking by and seeing <b> people </b> ravaging garbage cans, seeing <b> people </b> suffering on the street.'' The supplementary statement itself expresses the same sentiment: ``We have reviewed the demographic and clinical data and then, walking home, passed men asleep on heating grates or displaced <b> people </b> energetically searching in garbage piles for a few cents' income from aluminum cans,'' it says. ``We analyzed mortality data for the <b> homeless </b> but lacked any platform from which to shout that our neighbors are dying needlessly because we are incapable of providing the most basic services.'' ``We can no longer sit as spectators to the elderly <b> homeless </b> dying of hypothermia, to the <b> children </b> with blighted futures poisoned by lead in rat-infested dilapidated welfare hotels, to women raped, to old men beaten and robbed of their few possessions, and to pepole dying on the streets with catastrophic illness such as AIDS,'' the supplementary report said. It said the committee members who dissented against the report's limited nature endorsed its long list of recommendations, but ``felt continuously uneasy because of our inability to state the most basic recommendation: homelessness in the United States is an inexcusable disgrace and must be eliminated.'' </p> 0.394652789863667  \n",
              "   Hours after three <b> homeless </b> <b> people </b> were evicted from one boarded-up <b> house </b> owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, they moved into another unoccupied HUD house, officials said. The three are members of the Union for the Homeless, and HUD spokesman Ken Barnard accused them of seeking publicity. Police evicted Clotilde Lewis, 36, Duwayne Jackson, 39, and Floretta Logan, 27, from the first <b> house </b> Tuesday afternoon. Homeless Union members had helped them break into the <b> home </b> on Saturday. Lewis was handcuffed and taken to a police station when she refused to leave the first <b> house </b> but was released without being charged.

Hours after their eviction, the three settled into a boarded-up four-bedroom <b> house </b> with three kerosene heaters, clothes and hamburgers from a fast-food restaurant. They remained there early today while officials considered whether to arrest them and file trespassing charges, said William Harris, deputy director of the Detroit HUD office.

              "   The Supreme Court today let stand a $3.5 million punitive-damages award won by a San Diego gas station operator against Atlantic Richfield Co. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the second largest of its kind ever upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. John V. Nielsen had operated an ARCO station as an independent dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station to a mini-market and self-service station in 1979. His lawsuit charged ARCO with fraudulently misrepresenting facts in connection with the conversion of his station. A <b> state </b> <b> court </b> jury awarded Nielsen $525,788 in compensatory damages _ $79,061 in out-of-pocket losses, $396,727 in lost anticipated profits and $50,000 for emotional distress. The jury also awarded him $3.5 million in punitive damages against ARCO. A <b> state </b> <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> upheld the award except for the emotional-distress damages, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear ARCO's appeal. In the <b> appeal </b> acted on today, <b> lawyers </b> for ARCO argued that the huge punitive-damages award _ seven times the compensatory-damages award _ violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ``excessive fines.'' No <b> court </b> has ever applied that constitutional principle to non-criminal cases. The Supreme Court in May passed up deciding in a Mississippi <b> case </b> whether the constitutional ban on ``excessive fines'' can be applied to personal-injury lawsuits. Some <b> state </b> legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury lawsuits. Lawyers for ARCO urged the justices to ``send a clear signal that the <b> state </b> <b> courts </b> must stop these gargantuan awards.'' But <b> lawyers </b> for Nielsen argued that the ARCO <b> appeal </b> should not be granted because the oil company's <b> lawyers </b> had not raised the ``excessive fines'' argument in <b> state </b> courts. The justices refused to address the punitive-damages issue in the Mississippi <b> case </b> decided earlier this month after noting that it had not been raised in <b> state </b> courts. ARCO's <b> appeal </b> did not challenge the $475,000 compensatory-damages award won by Nielsen. The <b> case </b> is Atlantic Richfield vs. Nielsen, 87-1196. </p> 0.54935381321369  \n",
              "   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a $550,000 award won, and then lost, by a Texas couple whose daughter was born with deformities after her mother took the anti-nausea drug Bendectin. The justices, without comment, let stand a <b> federal </b> <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> <b> ruling </b> that overturned a jury award against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the drug's manufacturer. Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Brock of Moscow, Texas, sued Merrell Dow after their daughter, Rachel, was born with deformed limbs in 1982. A three-member panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out the $550,000 judgment a <b> federal </b> trial jury had awarded the Brocks. The <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> said there is no definitive scientific proof that Bendectin causes birth defects, and said the jury award was based on speculation. ``Speculation unconfirmed by ... proof cannot form the basis for causation in a <b> court </b> of law,'' the <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> said. The full 5th Circuit court, by a 8-6 vote, refused to review the three-member panel's ruling. The dissenters noted that six experts testified for the Brocks that Bendectin is capable of causing birth defects, and that three testified they believed the drug caused Rachel's deformities. The dissenting judges said appellate <b> courts </b> should not substitute their understanding of the facts for that of a jury merely because medical experts disagree. Bendectin was marketed by Richardson-Merrell Inc. between 1957 and 1983. More than 30 million women used the drug during pregnancy. Richardson-Merrell later became Merrell Dow, which last July merged with Marion Laboratories Inc. and became Marion Merrell Dow Inc., based in Kansas City. The company stopped selling Bendectin 1983, although the Federal Drug Administration never has rescinded approval of it. Merrell Dow in 1984 agreed to pay $120 million to more than 800 families to compensate children with birth defects allegedly caused by Bendectin. As part of the settlement, the corporation did not admit that the drug caused the defects. The settlement was rejected by a <b> federal </b> <b> appeals </b> court, and the lawsuits then went to a consolidated trial in Ohio, where Merrell Dow has its headquarters in Hamilton County. After a 22-day trial in 1985, an Ohio jury found that Bendectin did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses. The <b> case </b> acted on today is Brock vs. Merrell Dow, 89-1189. </p> 0.525270540212575  \n",
              "   California's <b> civil </b> <b> rights </b> commission may not award damages for emotional distress or other personal harm caused by job discrimination, the <b> state </b> Supreme Court <b> ruled </b> today. The 5-2 <b> ruling </b> eliminates the Fair Employment and Housing Commission's ability to <b> order </b> damages for bias victims who commonly suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation caused by employers' mistreatment. Those victims of sexual or racial harassment could still go to <b> court </b> and sue for a full range of damages. But suits are available only to those who can afford a lawyer. The <b> court </b> said the commission was authorized only to <b> order </b> back pay and reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require employers to take steps to prevent future discrimination. In a separate <b> decision </b> today, the <b> court </b> said discrimination victims were not required to file claims with the <b> state </b> before suing in court. The rulings come three years after the <b> court </b> prohibited the same commission from awarding punitive damages in flagrant <b> cases </b> of job discrimination. In that time, the Legislature has passed bills establishing the commission's authority to award both kinds of damages, but Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed them. Today's <b> ruling </b> was based on an interpretation of current <b> state </b> <b> law </b> and left open the possibility that the Legislature could pass a new <b> law </b> allowing the commission to award damages. But the opinion by Justice Edward Panelli hinted that unlimited damage awards by the commission, even if authorized by <b> state </b> law, might be found unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a jury trial. A jury in a <b> court </b> <b> case </b> ``is in the best position to determine just compensation for emotional and mental distress,'' Panelli wrote. The <b> ruling </b> overturned a $20,000 damage award by the commission to Rose Brown, a secretary for the Peralta Community College District in Oakland. She claimed she was fired in April 1981 for refusing sexual advances by an administrator at Laney College. </p> 0.515448070132596  \n",
              "   The Supreme Court today strengthened the right of criminal suspects to have <b> lawyers </b> present when they are questioned by police. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned the murder conviction of Mississippi death row inmate Robert S. Minnick, who confessed when he was questioned without his <b> lawyer </b> present. The <b> court </b> said Minnick's <b> rights </b> were violated even though he earlier had consulted with his <b> lawyer </b> and agreed to talk to authorities. Unless the suspect initiates such a talk with police, the <b> court </b> said, he may not be questioned outside the presence of his <b> lawyer </b> once he has invoked his right to a lawyer. In other action, the court: - Left intact a lawsuit settlement that eased restrictions on abortion clinics in Illinois. The court, without comment, rejected an <b> appeal </b> by two nurses and two expectant fathers who said the settlement does not adequately protect women or fetuses. - Refused to kill a lawsuit against a California community college's officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the on-campus performance of a racially charged play. The court, without comment, rejected an <b> appeal </b> by the college officials. - Shielded businesses from some big-money lawsuits filed by employees who claim they were fired so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits. The <b> court </b> <b> ruled </b> unanimously that fired employees may not sue4 in <b> state </b> <b> courts </b> over such allegations. The <b> state </b> suits are pre-empted by a <b> federal </b> <b> law </b> protecting pensions, the <b> court </b> said. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the <b> court </b> in the confession case, said, ``There can be no doubt that the interrogation in question was initiated by the police. It was a formal interview which (Minnick) was compelled to attend.'' ``Since (Minnick) made a specific request for counsel before the interview, the police-initiated interrogation was impermissible.'' In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority was ``misguided'' to discourage ``an honest confession.'' He said the <b> ruling </b> undermines a ``belief in either personal responsibility or the moral claim of just government to obedience.'' He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case. Minnick and James ``Monkey'' Dyess escaped from Clarke County, Miss., jail in April 1986 and went looking for guns, authorities said. Police said the two men fatally shot Donald Ellis Thomas and Lamar Lafferty when the victims returned to Thomas's mobile home to find Minnick and Dyess there. Minnick was arrested in Lemon Grove, Calif., on Aug. 22, 1986. FBI agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a lawyer. Minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to answer any more questions. A few days later, Deputy Sheriff J.C. Denham of Clarke County flew to California and questioned Minnick. The suspect confessed, saying he shot Lafferty because Dyess was threatening to kill Minnick if he did not. Minnick was convicted in Mississippi and sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court, in upholding his conviction, said Denham's questioning of Minnick did not violate a rule the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1981. The high <b> court </b> barred police from questioning a suspect who has asked for a <b> lawyer </b> unless the suspect initiates the conversation. Today the high <b> court </b> extended that <b> ruling </b> to instances in which a suspect already has conferred with an attorney. Kennedy said the 1981 <b> ruling </b> is designed to prevent police from badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a <b> lawyer </b> provided by the court's famous Miranda <b> ruling </b> in 1966. The threat of badgering is no less after the suspect has talked to his lawyer, Kennedy said. ``A single consultation with an attorney does not remove the suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to waive his <b> rights </b> or from the coercive pressures that accompany custody and that may increase as custody is prolonged,'' he said. The <b> case </b> is Minnick vs. Mississippi, 89-6332. </p> 0.509516901330661  \n",
              "   The Supreme Court today reinstated a $6.1 million award against the Arthur Young & Co. accounting firm won by investors in the Farmer's Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The justices, by a 5-4 vote, <b> ruled </b> that the promissory notes held by the co-op's investors are ``securities'' as defined by <b> federal </b> law. A <b> federal </b> <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> had thrown out the award after <b> ruling </b> that the notes were not securities. Sold for many years by the co-op to thousands of farmers, the notes were uninsured, payable on demand and yielded only interest. When the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984, about 1,600 of its 23,000 members held notes they had purchased for more than $10 million. Among other <b> legal </b> actions, investors filed a ``class action'' lawsuit against Arthur Young & Co., which had audited the co-op's 1981 and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those statements. The suit alleged that the accounting firm fraudulently had misled investors about the co-op's financial strength, in violation of a <b> federal </b> security law's anti-fraud provisions. A <b> federal </b> jury awarded the investors about $6.1 million in compensatory damages, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award when <b> ruling </b> that the notes were not securities. In disagreeing with the 8th Circuit court, Justice Thurgood Marshall noted ``Congress' broader purpose ... of ensuring that investments of all descriptions be regulated to prevent fraud and abuse.'' He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R.

The <b> cocaine </b> seized in Monday's operation near Colombia's northern coast was hidden among cargo bags and ready to be exported to the United States, said regional army commander Col. Carlos Castro. He said troops destroyed six cocaine-processing laboratories, <b> arrested </b> 103 suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers and found nearly 5,000 acres of coca leaf, the raw material used to make cocaine. Soldiers also seized 30 vehicles, all with Venezuelan license plates, which had been used to transport drugs, Castro said. Also confiscated were cocaine- processing chemicals and a cache of weapons, he said. The bust was considered one of the year's most important. So far in 1990 security forces have confiscated about 45 tons of cocaine, compared to 33 tons in all of 1989. Colombia's Medellin and Cali <b> cocaine </b> cartels supply most of the <b> cocaine </b> consumed in the United States. The coca leaf is mostly grown in Bolivia and Peru, then processed in Colombia.

              "   Two suspected Colombian <b> drug </b> traffickers were extradited to the United States on Tuesday, the first such extraditions since President Cesar Gaviria took office last month. Jose Hilario Ortiz and Raul Hernan Buchelli, who both face <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> charges in the United States, were placed on board a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane bound for Miami, national police chief Gen. Miguel Gomez said in remarks broadcast by the RCN radio network. Ortiz faces <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> charges in Connecticut and Buchelli is wanted in Florida, said a police spokesman, requesting anonymity. No further details were immediately available. Buchelli is wanted on charges of conspiracy to smuggle and distribute heroin and money laundering, while Ortiz pleaded guilty to a <b> cocaine </b> <b> trafficking </b> conspiracy charge and fled the country before sentencing, according to U.S. court records. Buchelli's brother, Guido Lucio, also faces <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> charges in the United States. But he was released last week after the government rejected a U.S. request for his extradition, citing insufficient evidence. Colombia has extradited 24 suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers to the United States since August 1989, when the government launched a major anti-drug crackdown after the murder of a presidential candidate. Twelve of those extradited have either been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty; one was acquitted. An additional nine are awaiting trial. The crackdown prompted the Medellin <b> cocaine </b> cartel to declare ``total war'' on the government a year ago. Tuesday's extraditions were the first of suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers to the United States since Gaviria was inaugurated Aug. 7. He has pledged to continue the war against the <b> cocaine </b> cartels waged by his predecessor, Virgilio Barco. Last Wednesday, Gaviria modified the country's extradition policy. In a nationally televised speech, Gaviria said <b> drug </b> traffickers who turn themselves in and confess their crimes would be tried in Colombia and not face extradition to the United States. Under the decree announced by Gaviria, Colombian judges would be also empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess and cooperate with local investigations. The country's <b> drug </b> barons have so far offered no reply to Gaviria's offer. Gaviria's offer appeared to be, at least in part, a response to repeated offers from the <b> drug </b> traffickers to surrender to Colombian judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had been resumed last year by Barco. The <b> drug </b> traffickers have feared extradition to the United States because they would have little influence over the judicial process there. Cocaine cartel members have traditionally been able to either bribe or threaten their way out of Colombian jails. Judges who refuse to be intimidated have often been slain. In his speech last week, Gaviria announced that three Colombians would soon be extradited to the United States, but he said three other U.S. extradition requests had been turned down. The third suspect set to be extradited, Joaquin Oswaldo Gallo Chamorro, was still being held in Colombia on Tuesday. Authorities did not say why he was not sent to the United States with Ortiz and Buchelli. With the latest extraditions, the U.S. Justice Department is still seeking to extradite 14 suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers held in Colombia. Colombia's Cali and Medellin <b> drug </b> cartels supply most of the <b> cocaine </b> consumed in the United States and Europe. Authorities blame the Medellin for killing about 550 Colombians the past year, including three presidential candidates. </p> 0.440929319990765  \n",
              "   U.S. Postal inspectors <b> arrested </b> 10 employees for <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> through the Dallas Main Post Office Tuesday night, following a nine-month undercover investigation. Postal Inspector Jim Travell said <b> authorities </b> are still looking for two more employees who were indicted for selling and distributing marijuana and <b> cocaine </b> at the postal processing center. ``The indictments were handed down by a Dallas grand jury and charged each postal worker with selling <b> drugs </b> to <b> agents </b> who worked in an undercover capacity at the facility,'' said Travell, of Fort Worth. Sealed indictments were handed down April 28, Travell said, but they were not unsealed until Tuesday to allow <b> authorities </b> time to organize the arrests. Those <b> arrested </b> are mail handlers or processors and distribution clerks who worked two evening shifts processing mail through the Dallas facility, Travell said. ``They worked different shifts and we have no reason to believe there was a conspiracy between them,'' Travell said. The employees, who have one to 10 years experience with the postal service, were <b> arrested </b> for selling between a quarter-ounce to several pounds of marijuana or between a half-gram to a quarter-ounce of <b> cocaine </b> in any one sale to the undercover officers, Travell said. ``The largest sale we did was $1,000,'' Travell said. ``Most of them ranged from $25 to $1,000 a sale. The jist of the investigation was dealers, not users.'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Webster of Dallas said the employees face pentalties of 5 years to 15 years in prison and fines of $150,000 to $200,000. Travell said inspectors were alerted to a <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> problem among the 4,000 workers at the facility by employees. ``Fellow employees are starting to be fed-up with this type of behavior,'' Travell said. </p> 0.440077480020122  \n",

              "   Gov. Evan Mecham broke the law and lied about it to the state Senate, a prosecutor said today in urging the Senate to convict the impeached first-term Republican and remove him from office. Prosecutor William French said in closing arguments that Mecham broke the law in borrowing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund for his auto dealership. ``He has violated the law ... He has uttered untruths to you,'' French said. Earlier, prosecutor Paul Eckstein accused Mecham of showing ``a lifetime of reckless disregard for the reputation of anyne who has stood in his path to political power.'' ``Respondent (Mecham) has demonstrated for all the world to see his plain inability to tell the truth,' Eckstein said. ``How much proof is required to demonstrate that respondent puffed, exaggerated, misremembered, dissembled and out-and-out lied.'' Eckstein said Mecham's conduct in <b> office </b> ``was not just offensive, it was grossly offensive.'' Senators must decide whether to convict Mecham on two <b> impeachment </b> charges issued by the Arizona House. A third charge was dismissed. A vote could come late today or Tuesday, climaxing five weeks of trial, lawmakers said. A conviction would force the first-term Republican out of office. The first <b> impeachment </b> count accuses the <b> governor </b> of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death <b> threat </b> by a state official. Mecham contended he did not intend to beak the law and that he was not fully informed of the seriousness of the alleged threat. ``Ignorance of the law is no defense,'' Eckstein told senators. But Mecham's defense lawyer, Fred Craft, told senators, ``You're being asked to politically assassinate the governor.'' ``He doesn't resign (as Mecham has been urged to) because he's not guilty of these charges,'' Craft said. ``He dares to right city hall and he's doing it at great cost to himself.'' Craft said in his closing argument that the allegation was based on a 90-second conversation with Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. Craft accused prosecutors of seeking to ``twist and torture it in such a way that it accounts for an obstruction of justice.'' As closing arguments proceeded, a trumpeter played ``Taps'' outside the Senate building as a group of men carried a mock coffin labeled, ``Herein Lies the Right to an Elected Governor.'' The prosecutor accused Mecham of making a number of statements during his Senate testimony that ``are either wrong'' or were contradicted by other witnesses. Among the examples cited by Eckstein was the governor's testimony, recanted a day later, that his former chief bodyguard had stolen a report from the governor's office. Nonetheless, Eckstein said, Mecham and Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead gave ``remarkably similar'' accounts of their Nov. 15 conversation in which Mecham allegedly ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general's investigation of the alleged threat. Mecham admitted in Senate testimony that he told Milstead, ``The attorney general is out to get me and I'm not going to help him in any way.'' Mecham sat at the defense table during closing arguments. When he arrived at the Capitol, he was cheered by a group of well-wishers as he walked into the Senate building behind bodyguards. He said nothing but smiled and flashed a thumbs-up signal at the crowd. Mecham, 63, who took <b> office </b> in January 1987, has maintained he is innocent of wrongdoing. He also is accused of misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. Last week the Senate dismissed a third charge that Mecham concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, the subject of the governor's April 21 criminal trial. Some <b> senators </b> said hearing testimony on that allegation could have prejudiced his criminal trial. However, Democrats acknowledged that the real reason they favored dismissing the charge was to ensure a Senate trial verdict well before the scheduled May 17 gubernatorial recall election. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required for conviction. Lawmakers also could bar Mecham from holding any future <b> public </b> office. If convicted, Mecham would become the seventh U.S. <b> governor </b> removed from <b> office </b> by impeachment. The prosecution contends the governor's protocol fund _ created with inaugural ball proceeds _ was a <b> public </b> fund and that Mecham Pontiac needed the $80,000 <b> loan </b> to meet its July 1987 payroll. However, the defense said the fund was private money and that the <b> loan </b> was intended merely to provide a higher interest rate for the fund. Mecham Pontiac was in good financial shape and could have borrowed the money elsewhere, according to testimony by the governor's son, Dennis, who is general manager of the dealership. But the day after he testified last week, Dennis Mecham announced the dealership was being sold. Sales had suffered due to the ``avalanche of negative publicity'' about the governor, he said. The allegation regarding the death <b> threat </b> has boiled down to Mecham's word against that of Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. He testified that Mecham ordered him not to cooperate with the attorney general's investigation of the alleged <b> threat </b> by state official Lee Watkins against former top Mecham aide Donna Carlson. At the time of the alleged <b> threat </b> in November, Ms. Carlson was about to testify before the state grand jury regarding the $350,000 campaign loan. Senators, meanwhile, said they knew how important the <b> impeachment </b> vote will be. If the <b> governor </b> is allowed to return to his job, ``I think there'll be terrible chaos in state government,'' said Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat. Lawmakers' own careers also may hang in the balance, some <b> senators </b> said. </p> 0.360770902047693  \n",
              "   Gov. Evan Mecham should be removed from <b> office </b> for obstructing an investigation of an alleged death threat, <b> senators </b> were told today during opening arguments of the first-term Republican's <b> impeachment </b> trial. But a defense attonrey for Mecham told <b> senators </b> in an impassioned statement that Mecham was the victim of a ``mutiny'' by the state attorney general and director of the state Department of Public Safety. Prosecutor William French said the man accused of making the alleged threat, former state official Lee Watkins, had claimed that jobs in the Mecham administration ``relate to the amount of money that you were able to bring into the campaign.'' French said the evidence was ``overwhelming'' that Mecham violated criminal laws and his oath of <b> office </b> and committed malfeasance in office, ``any one of which call for impeachment.'' However, defense attorney Fred Craft told <b> senators </b> in his opening statement that Mecham broke no laws and was acting within his authority. ``What has this man done?'' Craft said. ``There's something wrong in this state when you can depose the constitutionally elected officer of the state and throw the book at him ... based upon evidence that's being presented by people who have a stake in the outcome to have him ousted.'' Craft said the accusations resulted from a ``mutiny'' by Attorney General Bob Corbin and DPS Director Ralph Milstead. The DPS includes the Highway Patrol and investigative personnel. Craft also said he would present testimony that would cast dubt on Milstead's integrity. Mecham, who also faces a March 22 criminal trial and a May 17 recall election, did not appear at the Senate on the second day of his <b> impeachment </b> trial. The <b> impeachment </b> counts against Mecham include an allegation that he ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general's probe of an alleged death <b> threat </b> by Watkins, then the state prison construction chief. ``There was an obstruction with regard to an ongoing investigation that was being conducted by the attorney general's office,'' French said. Watkins has denied making a <b> threat </b> against Donna Carlson, a former top Mecham aide who testified before the state grand jury on Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan. DPS Officer Frank Martinez, a former member of Mecham's security detail who was called as the trial's first witness, testified this morning that Mecham administration official Peggy Griffith told him about a conversation she had with Watkins. Ms. Griffith said Watkins had told her that if Ms. Carlson ``did not keep her mouth shut, she could wind up taking a long boat ride ... and I know the right people who can help me,'' Martinez testified. Martinez said that he met with Milstead, other DPS officers, Corbin and several assistant attorneys general several days later and that Milstead told of a conversation he had with Mecham. Martinez said Milstead told the group that Mecham ``stated he didn't want him helping the attorney general.'' ``The overall mood was just amazement,'' Martinez testified. Craft said Milstead and other officials did not fully advise Mecham about the alleged threat, adding that Milstead ``was a feckless employee of this state and he did not serve that <b> governor </b> well.'' French said Watkins complained about the job he was given by Mecham and told Corrections Director Sam Lewis, ``If they don't treat me right I can bring Mecham's administration down.'' French warned the Senate to ``keep your eye on the ball'' and not be distracted by any attacks on witnesses in the case. ``Know that this is being done because there is no defense,'' French said. The opening arguments today dealt only with the alleged threat. Arguments will precede discussion of the other allegations against Mecham as they are reached during the trial. On the trial's opening day Monday, the Senate strongly rejected efforts to dismiss <b> impeachment </b> charges against Mecham. Also, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule today on a defense claim that the <b> impeachment </b> trial, the first of a U.S. <b> governor </b> in 59 years, should be delayed until after Mecham's March 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. The high court last week refused to grant a temporary delay, and Mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court if necessary. Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, said ``it was the first-day jitters for everyone'' in the <b> impeachment </b> trial's opening day Monday. ``It crosses everybody's mind _ the importance to do justice to the <b> governor </b> and the state,'' said Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, also a Republican. ``It's a large burden and we take it seriously.'' Senators refused to dismiss the 23 articles of <b> impeachment </b> against Mecham, whose attorney, Jerris Leonard, entered an innocent plea on his behalf. On 11 separate motions, the largest number of the 29 <b> senators </b> voting for dismissal was seven. Several <b> senators </b> said the vote should not be considered an indication that Mecham is likely to be convicted, saying they want to hear the evidence first. However, Sen. Jeff Hill, a Republican who has strongly backed Mecham, said the governor's conviction was virtually a foregone conclusion. ``I think that it's not likely that he's going to prevail,'' he said. If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be removed from <b> office </b> and could be permanently barred from holding elective <b> office </b> in Arizona. Mecham, 63, won election in a three-way race after five tries. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and insisted he will survive both trials and a May 17 recall election and return to the <b> office </b> he gave up to acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, when he was impeached by the House on Feb. 5. </p> 0.342604915673256  \n",
              "   His governorship gone, his ailing auto dealership sold, Evan Mecham faces a future in which one of the few certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial. But for Arizona, the future looks brighter without the shadow of Mecham's embarrassing <b> impeachment </b> trial hanging over the state, said Rose Mofford, who became <b> governor </b> with Mecham's removal. ``Today we have reached the end of some difficult times in Arizona,'' Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, said Monday. ``I know the decision made by the Senate today was not reached lightly. It is time to put all that behind us and move forward.'' ``Today none of us are Republicans, none of us are Democrats,'' she said. ``We are all Arizonans. Let us go forward together as Arizonans.'' The impeached first-term Republican was stripped of his <b> office </b> Monday when the Senate convicted him of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death <b> threat </b> and misusing the governor's protocol fund. The end of the trial did not heal the divisions that arose during Mecham's turbulent 15 months in office. Predictably, the verdict was praised by Mecham opponents and condemned by supporters. Some legislators received police protection Monday night after getting threatening phone calls that were prompted by the vote, said Department of Public Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt. ``They've been all types of intimidating-type threatening statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,'' Schmidt said. Mecham's future troubles could include a maximum 22-year prison sentence if he is convicted on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. He faces trial April 21 in Maricopa County Superior Court on six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents. His brother Willard, who was his 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. The Senate threw out an <b> impeachment </b> count based on the $350,000 <b> loan </b> issue. Although the Senate did not bar Mecham from holding <b> public </b> <b> office </b> again, his lawyer, Jerris Leonard, indicated after the <b> impeachment </b> vote that Mecham may decide to bow out of politics. ``I think there is doubt,'' he said of whether Mecham would try to appeal his case to voters in a recall election May 17. It was not clear whether the ousted <b> governor </b> could remain on the recall ballot given him <b> impeachment </b> conviction. The matter probably will be decided by the courts, said Attorney General Bob Corbin. Leonard said, ``I think the decision of where we go from now is dependent on whether or not the <b> governor </b> himself wants to stay in politics and that's something that he's got to decide overnight.'' After Monday's conviction, Mecham left the Senate chamber smiling. Asked what he planned next, he said, ``We'll decide tomorrow or the next day ... We're keeping all our options open.'' After he was impeached by the House of Representatives on Feb. 5, the 63-year-old Mecham hinted he might give up politics. ``If I can be of service, fine,'' he said. ``If not, I'd enjoy private life. The best person doesn't always win. Politics is not my favorite pastime.'' Mecham ran for <b> governor </b> five times before being elected in 1986. Although Mecham's son, Dennis, testified last week that their Mecham Pontiac dealership in suburban Glendale was thriving, he announced a day later that they'd been forced to sell it for $4 million because of dwindling sales. Dennis Mecham said bad publicity surrounding his father's political battles had driven customers away. The dealership was sold last week. </p> 0.339381693729968  \n",
              "   Skull and Bones, the oldest and most secret senior <b> society </b> at Yale University, boasts many distinguished alumni but none more prominent today than a ``spook'' from the class of 1948 _ George Herbert Walker Bush. Little is known about the strange rituals and practices of the 156-year-old society, and that's the way its members want it. The rites are rumored to include placing initiates in a coffin and requiring them to plunge naked into a pile of mud. Some of the rumors come from rival societies, and may be suspect. No one but members really know what goes on inside the windowless, mausoleum-style structure of brown sandstone to which Bonesmen retreat. But as the Republican presidential nominee's own experience has shown, membership in the <b> society </b> forms powerful bonds of friendship that endure long after graduation. The vice president was one of 15 Yale juniors tapped for Skull and Bones in 1947. To this day, the Bonesmen who once heard him recount some of the innermost secrets of his life remain his good friends. Perhaps because of the pledge of secrecy that Bonesmen take, Bush did not mention his Skull and Bones membership in his autobiography, ``Looking Forward.'' The <b> society </b> has long been suspected of ritualistic thefts. A group of history buffs in El Paso, Texas, claimed that the <b> skull </b> referred to in the society's name belongs to Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, whose grave was robbed in 1926. Endicott Davison, a lawyer who says he speaks for Skull and Bones, said the <b> society </b> does not have the skull. The former chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe in Arizona charged recently that Bush's father, Prescott Bush, stole the <b> skull </b> of Apache chief Geronimo years ago, and that it is still on display at Skull and Bones' inner sanctum. That claim was denied by the vice president's brother, Jonathan Bush. One thing is not disputed: Bush the Bonesman is in powerful company. Brothers of the order have included Henry Stimson, Averell Harriman, Henry Luce, Potter Stewart, McGeorge Bundy, Archibald MacLeish, William F. Buckley Jr. and William Sloan Coffin Jr. Prescott Bush, a Republican senator from Connecticut, was a member. So was Bush's oldest son, George W. Bush, and about a half-dozen other family members. Skull and Bones is arguably the most famous and influential secret <b> society </b> in the United States, having served as a model for others that followed at Yale and other institutions. It was founded by William Russell, a member of the Yale Class of 1833, apparently in reaction to the stripping of secrecy from Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic society, during the rise of a national anti-secrecy movement. Skull and Bones is a private organization incorporated as the Russell Trust Association. It pays taxes to the city of New Haven and owns Deer Island, a resort on the St. Lawrence River. Giving Skull and Bones the benefit of the doubt, Brooks Mather Kelly, in a 1974 history of Yale, wrote of the society: ``Its purpose and programs were not revealed when it was founded and have never since been known. But that like most Yale societies it pretends to some intellectual and educational purpose can probably be assumed.'' The <b> society </b> ``comes from a tradition of elitism of which Yale was at the center,'' said Dan A. Oren, author of ``Joining The Club,'' a book published in 1985 about the relationship between the university and Jews. Skull and Bones became the first of the secret societies to admit a Jew in 1937. During the 1960s, the <b> society </b> tapped a number of outspoken radicals. Even today, however, it remains steadfastly all-male. Of Yale's seven secret undergraduate societies, only one other _ Wolf's Head _ refuses to admit women. Having women as members would interfere with one of the ways Bonesmen become true brothers. By all accounts, Skull and Bones initiates must lay bare their souls, telling their sexual histories and life stories in graphic detail. ``The danger of secret societies and entering into the club world is it allows members to lose sight of the common folk who aren't part of the elite,'' Oren said. But he said that Bush's experiences in World War II combat worked the other way. ``For so many veterans, their fight was against the racists and the bigoted values of Nazi Germany, so when they came back, they were embued with a strong sense of egalitarianism,'' Oren said. Bush, 21 and already married, entered Yale in 1945 after his discharge from the Navy, which awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for his wartime exploits. While on one combat mission, Bush's plane was shot down and he was rescued by a submarine. Two fellow crewmen perished. Bush recounted his brush with death for Bonesmen in 1947 with great emotion, says former Rep. Thomas W.L. Ashley, D-Ohio, another member of the Bones class of 1948. ``What comes to mind was, he was an awful young guy who had had an idyllic kind of childhood who suddenly found himself in an airplane that was on fire facing a lot of death around him and almost certain death himself,'' Ashley said. Ashley and other Bonesmen in his Yale class are still close friends of Bush. ``Obviously, we became fond of each other,'' Ashley said. ``This was something kind of special to us.'' He added: ``George Bush is exactly just as loyal to other friends as those who happened to be in the <b> society </b> with him. His friendship across the social range is known to everyone.'' Members of the Bones class of 1948 came to Washington in 1981 for a reunion that included dinner at the vice president's mansion and a tour of the White House Oval Office. ``His having been a member of Skull and Bones and his continued involvement as an alumnus means he would probably be likely to draw upon past connections for the White House,'' Oren said. ``But his choice of people _ James Baker III to be campaign manager, Dan Quayle as vice president _ shows he's willing to go beyond Yale,'' Oren said. ``He has always maintained close connections to Skull and Bones, but his world certainly goes beyond New Haven.'' </p> 0.285543267407195  \n",
              "   A jury on Thursday convicted former U.S. Rep. Sam Steiger of theft by extortion for threatening a parole board member to get his vote on a personnel matter while serving in the Evan Mecham administration. ``Any time you go to court you can expect a guilty verdict, but it's difficult to believe,'' Steiger said in the courtroom moments after the jury returned its verdict. Steiger, who was a top aide to the now-ousted Republican governor, was accused of threatening Ron Johnson, a member of the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. Steiger allegedly threatened to withhold permission for Johnson to work as a part-time Tempe justice of the peace and to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain as executive director Patricia Costello, a Mecham appointee. Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court scheduled a May 6 sentencing for the 59-year-old Steiger, who faces up to five years in prison. Asked whether the verdict would be appealed, defense attorney Thomas Karas said, ``We'll take it one step at a time.'' Steiger said, ``That's up to counsel.'' Jury foreman Greg Jones, a fire captain in suburban Mesa, said the deciding factor behind the verdict was ``the tapes of the phone call between Steiger and Johnson.'' Johnson called Steiger at home from the <b> office </b> of the state attorney general, who taped the call. During testimony Monday, Steiger denied that he threatened Johnson or told him how he should vote. But the state alleged that Steiger followed up on the alleged <b> threat </b> in a letter and a telephone conversation after Johnson voted with the board majority to seek Ms. Costello's resignation. The board voted 4-3 that Ms. Costello should step down because of low staff morale. Steiger, a former five-term congressman, testified that he did suggest that Johnson should back Ms. Costello but denied that he tried to ``steal'' Johnson's vote by threatening his job. Karas had asked Reinstein to declare a mistrial, contending the conviction of Mecham at his state Senate <b> impeachment </b> trial Monday might prejudice jurors against Steiger. However, Reinstein ruled that great care had been taken to select unbiased jurors. Steiger gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. </p> </details> \n",

              "   A small <b> earthquake </b> rattled central Utah early today, but there were no reports of <b> damage </b> or injury. The <b> quake </b> struck at 6:44 a.m. and registered 4.6 on the Richter <b> scale </b> of <b> ground </b> motion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Service at Golden, Colo. It was an aftershock of an earlier temblor. Initial reports of the <b> quake </b> came from Price, East Carbon and Helper. The quake's epicenter was 34 <b> miles </b> <b> south </b> of Price. The Carbon County sheriff's office said it received numerous calls, and the Emery County sheriff's office also received a few calls from <b> residents </b> asking about the earthquake. The central Utah <b> area </b> was <b> hit </b> by three quakes on Sunday, the largest of which was 5.6 on the Richter scale.

              "   A minor <b> earthquake </b> shook pictures off walls in two central Oklahoma communities early today but experts said there was no connection with a potential major <b> quake </b> on the New Madrid Fault. The Oklahoma Geological Survey said the <b> quake </b> registered 3.6 on the Richter <b> scale </b> of <b> ground </b> movement. A <b> quake </b> of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage. A <b> quake </b> of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. The National Weather Service said it had received reports of a tremor about 5:45 a.m. that was felt in Rush Springs, about 40 <b> miles </b> southwest of Oklahoma City, and Lindsay, about 28 <b> miles </b> <b> south </b> of Oklahoma City. The geological survey said the <b> quake </b> was centered 5 <b> miles </b> <b> north </b> of Lindsay. ``Police departments in those areas indicate that pictures fell from walls, objects were knocked off tables and out of cabinets and many <b> residents </b> were awakened,'' the weather service said in a statement. Geological survey director Charles Mankin said earthquakes are common in Oklahoma, with a couple a week detected by sensitive seismographs. ``We rarely record them as high as 3.6,'' he said. ``But a small <b> earthquake </b> in that <b> area </b> is not unusual.'' Larry Thompson of KBLP radio in Lindsay said the station was flooded with calls after the tremor was felt. At the police department, dispatcher Lois Knapp said the shaking lasted about two seconds. ``This police department is cement and brick and rock, and it moved,'' she said. There has been increased concern about a Midwestern <b> earthquake </b> since a New Mexico climatologist projected that there could be a major one in early December along the New Madrid Fault, which runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark. The projection, based on the fact that tidal forces will be particularly strong early next month, is disputed by most scientists. Mankin said there was no link between today's <b> quake </b> and the New Madrid Fault. ``Most of the earthquakes in Oklahoma we have not been able to relate to faults,`` Mankin said. ``They're very shallow earthquakes and we know they're from some <b> ground </b> adjustment, obviously, but we can't relate them to some fault.'' In 1811-1812, a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the Richter <b> scale </b> struck the New Madrid Fault, ringing church bells in Washington, D.C., more than 850 <b> miles </b> away. Jim Lawson, chief geophysicist at the geological survey, said earlier this week that even if a major <b> quake </b> occurred along the New Madrid Fault, its effect in Oklahoma would be negligible. </p> </details> \n",

              "   The disposition of an individual's <b> estate </b> need not be a guessing game. Yet many people are unaware that by establishing a sound <b> estate </b> plan they easily may shelter many holdings from probate. Still more don't know the principles behind assessing their estate. But by better understanding how the <b> federal </b> government governs <b> estate </b> taxes, people may avoid or reduce the future <b> federal </b> <b> tax </b> liabilities. This <b> tax </b> savings can preserve assets in the <b> estate </b> that otherwise might be used to <b> pay </b> death taxes. These assets then may be passed on to a spouse, children, or charity. There are several steps to take in evaluating your estate. First, determine the nature and the value of your estate's assets. Assts may include: your residence, other <b> property </b> such as a vacation home, household furnishings, savings bonds, stocks, checking and savings accounts, pension benefits, life <b> insurance </b> policies, automobiles. For <b> federal </b> <b> tax </b> purposes, there are several exceptions to determining the value of an asset: - For jointly owned assets held by spouses, only half the value of the asset is included in your <b> estate </b> if you are the first spouse to die. - For life <b> insurance </b> policies, the <b> amount </b> included in your <b> estate </b> is the face <b> amount </b> of the policy rather than its replacement cost or present cash value (if whole life) at the date of your death. - If you die before retirement, you receive none of your pension. However, half the value of the pension is payable to your spouse and half the vested plan <b> benefits </b> - what would have been available to you had you lived to retirement - are included in your gross estate. - Finally, Series EE bonds are included at their present value when they mature. - All other assets generally are included at fair market value. Second, determine your deductions when calculating <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> tax. Include funeral expenses, costs of the last illness of the decendent, if applicable; unpaid debts and mortgages; and administrative expenses for the estate. You'll incur fewer administrative expenses for assets transferred outside of the probate. To avoid probate, you may set up a living trust, although it will create some trust administration costs. In addition, <b> property </b> held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant outside the probate process. Other <b> property </b> of a contractual nature - such as life <b> insurance </b> policies or qualified pension plans - also will transfer to the beneficiary outside of probate. Step three, determine which <b> property </b> qualifies for the marital deduction or charitable deduction. Three factors make a difference: - If your will transfers <b> property </b> to your spouse, this <b> property </b> qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any <b> property </b> is held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the <b> property </b> passes to the surviving spouse and qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any life <b> insurance </b> or qualified pension plan names your spouse as policy beneficiary or plan benificiary, this, too, qualifies. The same kinds of arrangements will qualify <b> property </b> for the charitable <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> deduction if <b> property </b> is left to the charity as a result of a will, a specific <b> property </b> designation such as a joint tenancy, or a contractual benificiary designation. Any <b> property </b> qualifying for the marital deduction or the charitable deduction is not subject to <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability. Remaining <b> property </b> is referred to as the taxable estate. The fourth, and final, step is to determine estimated <b> federal </b> <b> tax </b> liability on the taxable estate. The unified <b> estate </b> and gift transfer <b> tax </b> rates apply to the taxable <b> estate </b> when calculating the <b> amount </b> of <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> tax. Every individual, regardless of the size of his or her estate, is entitled to a unified credit of $192,800 that absorbs, dollar for dollar, the <b> amount </b> of that individual's <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability up to that amount. This assumes that you did not make any lifetime gifts to an individual in any one <b> year </b> while alive that exceeded the <b> amount </b> of the gift <b> tax </b> annual exclusion <b> amount </b> of $10,000. Here, a rule of thumb applies. For your <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability to be greater than $192,800, your taxable <b> estate </b> must be greater than $600,000. As long as a husband and wife each hold $600,000 in separately owned assets, the couple can own a total of $1.2 million in assets and the entire <b> amount </b> for both estates avoids <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability. The process of rearranging <b> property </b> ownership for <b> estate </b> assets, so that each spouse's <b> estate </b> takes maximum advantage is known as ``estate equalization.'' Many people assume they won't have assets exceeding $600,000, but in these days of appreciated home values and sizable pension plans or life <b> insurance </b> policies, estates are often of surprising size. --- EDITOR'S NOTE - Paul Lochray is an academic associate in the <b> estate </b> planning division of the College for Financial Planning in Denver. </p> 0.53898425780541  \n",

              "   The government is losing billions of dollars in <b> tax </b> revenues each <b> year </b> because the Internal Revenue Service does not use an enforcement program on business <b> taxpayers </b> that it has been using effectively on individuals, a House panel said Monday. A report from the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between $3.2 billion and $8 billion a <b> year </b> in <b> taxes </b> on <b> interest </b> and dividends earned by businesses is never collected because the <b> income </b> is not reported to the IRS. While the <b> revenue </b> loss estimates ``are not statistically precise,'' the report said they provide ample justification for the IRS to include businesses in the document-matching program it now uses to verify <b> interest </b> and dividend earnings on individual <b> tax </b> returns. Under the existing document-matching program, the IRS compares ``information returns'' detailing <b> interest </b> and dividend <b> payments </b> to individuals with the individuals' actual <b> income </b> <b> tax </b> returns. The program in fiscal 1985 produced $2.35 billion in additional <b> tax </b> <b> revenue </b> from individuals. Although banks and corporations are not required to file such information <b> returns </b> on <b> income </b> <b> payments </b> to corporations, the House report said the IRS received _ but never used _ 26 million such <b> returns </b> in 1985, showing <b> income </b> <b> payments </b> to 5 million businesses totaling $987 billion. ``By casting these information <b> returns </b> aside, IRS is not only missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported business <b> tax </b> liabilities but has created a double standard of enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than individuals,'' said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee. IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday the agency has not seen the House report and will have no comment until agecny officials can review it. But at a hearing before Barnard's subcommittee last year, IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said the costs of implementing a document-matching program for corporations would not be justified by the additional <b> revenue </b> that would be generated. Gibbs said the administrative costs of a document-matching program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different names. Although the problems cited by Gibbs all ``pertain to the way <b> income </b> is reported'' to the IRS, the House report said the IRS ``never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial document-matching program encompassing those corporations to which the difficulties do not pertain.'' Gibbs told the subcommittee last <b> year </b> the IRS would begin using document-matching to verify <b> income </b> reported on <b> tax </b> <b> returns </b> from single-owner businesses and would initiate a multi-year study to determine the extent of business underreporting of <b> interest </b> and dividend income. He also promised to begin a test program using information <b> returns </b> to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file any <b> income </b> <b> tax </b> return. The House report said the test program in one district office was so effective the IRS now has expanded it to nine more districts and could have a document-matching program ready by next spring to identify non-filers among corporations and partnerships nationwide. But despite such efforts, Barnard said the IRS ``has not been sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated computer matching capabilities to businesses.'' ``Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and every one of their <b> returns </b> will be scrutinized by IRS' computers for unreported <b> income </b> deserve to know why corporate and partnership <b> returns </b> are being excused from this automatic examination process,'' Barnard said. The report said Congress should help the IRS set up a document-matching program for corporate <b> returns </b> by enacting legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions report to the IRS all dividend and <b> interest </b> <b> payments </b> to corporations. Barnard introduced such legislation earlier this year, but it was never reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee. </p> 0.424224737025707  \n",
              "   Social Security officials say a quadriplegic who won a seat in the Legislature has been warned he could lose his medical <b> benefits </b> if he takes his newly won seat and begins drawing expense reimbursements. Bill Boharski, a Kalispell Republican, defeated Democrat Gordon Hall in November, to win his first term in the Montana House. But after drawing expense reimbursements for attending legislative caucuses in November, Boharski said he was notified the reimbursements were ``unearned income'' that would make him ineligible for continued medical <b> benefits </b> under Medicare and Medicaid. And Boharski, who is paralyzed from injuries he suffered in an automobile accident five years ago, says he can't afford to lose the money. He estimates his medical expenses at $15,000 a year. ``That put me in a position where I had to seriously consider whether or not I had to resign my position,'' the 27-year-old legislator-elect said. ``That <b> amount </b> of medical bills isn't something you can just pay.'' Boharski said the situation is not desperate because state and <b> federal </b> officials are trying to help. Legislative leaders say they're considering a change in state compensation law to redefine the reimbursements, and Boharski said Social Security has advised him the case is under review. Boharski also said he will ask Congress for help if need be. Montana legislators earn $52.13 for each working day in the session plus $50 a day during the session as reimbursement for living expenses in Helena. The 1989 session begins Monday. It's the expense reimbursement that concerns Social Security Administration officials. Mark Fredenberg, operations supervisor for the agency's Kalispell office, said that under <b> federal </b> law, the expense allowances are considered unearned income. Social Security disability <b> benefits </b> are reduced by the <b> amount </b> of unearned <b> income </b> over $20 that a person receives, he said. And a person who loses eligibility for those <b> payments </b> because of unearned <b> income </b> also loses eligibility for medical coverage, he said. Most people receiving disability <b> payments </b> don't work or don't travel to work, Fredenberg noted, saying a situation such as Boharski's arises ``very, very seldom.'' Boharski said he checked into the <b> federal </b> regulations before he filed for office last spring. He said he was told then he would qualify for continued medical <b> benefits </b> if elected, under a program that allows people to continue receiving medical coverage even if they are working. Boharski said Social Security officials have since told him he should be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. But, he said, he hasn't yet received written verification. Fredenberg said he could not comment directly on Boharski's case because of <b> federal </b> privacy laws. Boharski said if legislation at the state level doesn't resolve the problem, he will try to have changes made at the <b> federal </b> level so he can retain his legislative seat. ``I'm counting on staying,'' he said. ``Anyone who knows me knows I don't quit that easy.'' </p> </details> \n",

              "   Rival Christian <b> forces </b> today used a cease-fire to stockpile weapons and redeploy <b> troops </b> for their next battle, while civilians fled their ruined neighborhoods for refuge in safer Moslem areas. Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia, refused to give any concessions to Gen. Michel Aoun and said his fighters were ready for war. A source close to Geagea's command said his militia had adopted a new <b> military </b> plan to block any attempt by Aoun to storm its strongholds if the current cease-fire collapses. ``If clashes break out anew, it will be a tough, crushing battle throughout the Christian enclave,'' the source said. Snipers <b> killed </b> one person and <b> wounded </b> five in various parts of the Christian enclave today, police said. By police count, the fight for the 310-square-mile enclave has <b> killed </b> at least 673 people and <b> wounded </b> 1,877, in addition to inflicting more than $750 million in damage. The dead include 97 <b> soldiers </b> <b> killed </b> since the confrontation broke out Jan. 30. The <b> fighting </b> began when Geagea refused Aoun's demand that he disband the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia in Lebanon. Geagea's 6,000-strong militia has deployed about one-third of its fighters in east Beirut, the <b> military </b> source said. They are to defend its urban strongholds and deny Aoun access to the port through the streets of the Ashrafiyeh district. Aoun lost the port in the early days of the fighting. Military analysts believe Aoun must regain control of the port to ensure safe supply lines by sea before accepting any peace settlement. The Lebanese Forces moved new heavy fire power into place in the Kesrouan mountains to harass Aoun's back if he tries to move into the port area, the source said. The upgraded fire power includes about 120 truck-mounted multi-barreled rocket launchers brought out of weapons depots. The launchers, obtained from Iraq more than a year ago, can fire 40 122mm shells a minute. Geagea's men are outnumbered by Aoun's <b> army </b> at least 3-to-1 and hoped to counter his superiority with their upgraded weapons, the source said. Lebanese <b> forces </b> militiamen, with nearly 15 years' experience in street battles, ``are waiting for Aoun's <b> army </b> in the narrow alleys of Ashrafiyeh, which has become a huge garrison,'' the source said. The militia force defending the port, Ashrafiyeh and the <b> military </b> headquarters of Karantina have been beefed up from 1,200 to 2,000 men, the source said. The surrender of Aoun's <b> troops </b> Saturday at Adma, an isolated pocket in Kesrouan, freed the militiamen for the new deployment. The source said the bulk of the militia's <b> fighting </b> force, backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers, was deployed along the southern and eastern edges of Kesrouan province, separated from Aoun's <b> troops </b> by a no-man's-land of just a few hundred yards. A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations, confirmed that both factions were bolstering their forces. Aoun's <b> army </b> stockpiled ammunition, especially tank cannon and howitzer rounds, in depots in the Metin mountains northeast of the capital. Meanwhile, civilians continued to desert the Christian enclave, seeking refuge in the predominately Moslem areas outside the enclave. The Christian communities, dispersed throughout Lebanon before the civil war, have gradually consolidated in the enclave since 1975. </p> 0.59707854563647  \n",
              "   Christian and Moslem militiamen today exchanged mortar fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line. No casualties were reported. The two-hour battle in downtown Beirut came amid reports of growing tension between a Christian militia and the Lebanese army. There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth between civil war antagonists in Beirut in two weeks. The clashes have strained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975. The <b> fighting </b> coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, in east Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital. Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all over the Christian sector of Beirut and along the main coastal highway running north from the city, witnesses reported. Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons searched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But the Christian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension between the militia and the Lebanese army, which is controlled by Christian officers. The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexing show to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army. The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. Michel Aoun, has been quoted by several Beirut newspapers recently as saying the <b> military </b> could finish off the militia any time it wanted. Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by the Maronite Catholic commander to become the next president of Lebanon after President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires in September. Aoun, who has not denied the statements, has not offically proclaimed his candidacy. </p> 0.575284714154695  \n",
              "   Israeli-backed Christian militiamen shelled a U.N.-policed vilage in south Lebanon today, wounding an Irish peacekeeper, three Lebanese women and an 8-year-old boy. Timur Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, said the Irishman was injured in the head when a 60mm mortar round crashed into one of the Irish battalion posts in Qabrikha, 18 miles east of Tyre. He declined to give the Irishman's name. Lebanese police later said four villagers, including three women and a boy, also were <b> wounded </b> in the bombardment. Police said the South Lebanon Army militia opened up on the Shiite Moslem village after a roadside <b> bomb </b> exploded in the village of Qantara, in Israel's self-designated securitu zone in south Lebanon.

No one immediately claimed <b> responsibility </b> for Thursday night's failed attack but a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabular said the Irish Republican Army was suspected. The RUC spokesman said armed, masked men kidnapped a man from his home near Newtown Butler and ordered him to drive a truck containing a 3,500-pound <b> bomb </b> to an <b> army </b> checkpoint at Annaghmartin. The gang tied up the man's elderly parents and locked them in a bathroom while the man was driven near the checkpoint, 56 miles southwest of Belfast. The man was told to deliver the bomb, which they said had a five-minute timer, police said. The man drove the red pickup to the checkpoint, jumped out and shouted a warning. A short time later there was a small explosion, which was believed to have been caused by the detonator going off, police said. Army <b> bomb </b> experts defused the bomb, one of the largest ever found in Northern Ireland, police said. The <b> army </b> said there was only minimal damage and no one was injured. On Oct. 24, the IRA staged three human <b> bomb </b> <b> attacks </b> which <b> killed </b> six <b> soldiers </b> and a civilian, who drove one of the bombs to the <b> army </b> targets.

              "   As George Bush approaches the high noon of his quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he is striving to move out of the shadow cast by President Reagan while seeking to capitalize on Reagan's enormous popularity. Reagan's shadow has already shortened for Bush. These days he is seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the president. Instead, the questions now center on whether his candidacy is exerting too much influence over the Reagan White House. Both Bush and Reagan in recent days have fended off suggestions that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort to help the Bush campaign. And confronted with public opinion polls showing Bush far behind among Democrats who voted for Reagan, Bush advisers have now switched strategy to make sure that the Reagan shadow doesn't disappear altogether. After first planning no contact at the Republican National Convention between Reagan and his <b> vice </b> president, a joint rally is now scheduled for Tuesday in New Orleans. It follows an upbeat joint appearance between Reagan and Bush at a rally last Friday for senior <b> administration </b> officials at the Old Executive Office Building, during which Reagan lavished praise on his <b> vice </b> president. If all goes as planned, Bush's transformation into his own man will be complete when he accepts the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, according to aides and GOP consultants. By the end of the convention, ``all the emphasis is going to be on George Bush and his <b> vice </b> presidential nominee,'' said his chief of staff, Craig Fuller. Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, said that Bush ``has made a conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to the president.'' ``And now that he's running for the <b> president </b> himself, he's talking about how he feels, what he believes in, and where he wants to take the country,'' Atwater said. To be sure, there are some areas in which Bush does not want to put much light between himself and Reagan _ largely the current <b> economic </b> expansion, now in a peacetime record of 69 months, and the fact that most of the world is at peace. The <b> vice </b> <b> president </b> has been inching away from his close identification with <b> administration </b> policies since he and aides huddled for a week in late May at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine. The consensus from his advisers was near-unanimous: he had to do more to establish his own agenda. Since then, Bush has hinted that he would be more aggressive in dealing with the Soviets, would enforce civil-rights laws more vigorously, would spend more on education and do more to clean up the environment than the <b> president </b> he has served for the past 7{ years. He has also proposed many of his own initiatives, including a $2.2 billion child care program, a ban on offshore ocean dumping, and a reorganizaton of the anti-drug effort under the <b> office </b> of <b> vice </b> president. He also has proposed a new White House ethics <b> office </b> and a ``flexible freeze'' on federal spending. But most of Bush's moves away from the <b> administration </b> have been cautious, for fear of appearing disloyal. ``I'm not going to change just to emerge from a shadow,'' he has said. In a recent interview, Bush said he will differ with Reagan when he feels he has a different set of goals. ``I have every intention of saying, here is what we've done and and here are my priorities. ``But I'm not doing that to quote distance myself, to show my own identity,'' he continued. ``I'm doing it to say, look, here is what we've done. Here are the successes, and here are the shortcomings, and here's what George Bush will do.'' Still, Bush's close identification with the <b> administration </b> continues to pose problems for him as Democrats keep driving home their ``Where is George?'' slogan. When the general election campaign heats up after Labor Day, Bush is expected to be hit repeatedly by Democrats for his role _ still vague _ in some of the less popular Reagan <b> administration </b> decisions, including arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran and past support for Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Meanwhile, the impact of Bush's candidacy has already been seen in a number of recent presidential decisions _ including Reagan's selection last week of a Hispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to be education <b> secretary </b> _ fulfilling in advance a Bush campaign pledge. Reagan filled two other Cabinet vacancies with people on close terms with Bush, naming former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh to succeed Edwin Meese as attorney general and Wall Street investment banker Nicholas F. Brady to follow James A. Baker III as treasury secretary. Baker resigned to run Bush's campaign. The <b> president </b> also yielded to Bush's urgings in deciding to allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in the president's veto of a $299.5 billion defense authorization bill. Reagan also has picked up on some of Bush's campaign themes, including advocating the death penalty for ``drug kingpins.'' ``I don't think it's as much a matter of Bush disagreeing or separating himself from Reagan as much as demonstrating that his agenda is a little different,'' said GOP consultant Charlie Black, who is a Bush convention adviser. And John Sears, another Republican consultant, said: ``The real moment of truth is when Bush accepts the nomination.'' ``He can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of the Reagan <b> administration </b> have brought to the country. And he can prove himself presidential. In his acceptance speech, he can do it all,'' Sears said. </p> 0.343152635790944  \n",
              "   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Thank you. Thank you very much. Theresa. You're an outstanding member of the North Carolina Legislature, and I know that you're going to have a resounding re-election victory in November. Thank you so much. Peace, progress, opportunity. That's what we're here to celebrate. That's the legacy of a great president, Ronald Reagan. And that will be the living legacy of the next <b> president </b> of the United States, George Bush. First, let me thank the Democratic Party <b> leaders </b> for televising their Convention. What I saw and heard reminded me and millions of other former Democrats why we're proud to be Republicans. The Dukakis convention speech was just like the Democrat platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on spending. We're not running against Bentsen and Dukakis, we're running against Bentsen and Hedges. ``Governor Hedges,'' ``Governor Hedges,'' ``Governor Hedges'' tried mightily to paint over his liberal policies with pretty rhetoric. But the make-up job failed. As an old federal trade commissioner, I want to know -- whatever happened to truth in advertising? But we've come to New Orleans not to pin the tail on the donkey. We're here to pin our hopes on the American future. And we're not buying the Dukakis deception. Despite what he says, this election is about ideas and ideology. They do matter. They will matter to Americans who face a choice this year as stark and dramatic as any in memory. We Americans faced a similar choice in 1980. And what did we get for our choice? We got a <b> president </b> who doesn't apologize for American interests _ he asserts them. We got a breakthrough in Soviet relations and the INF treaty. We got the longest <b> economic </b> boom in peacetime history. It was my privilege for seven years to serve the man who made this happen _ one of America's greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, for that opportunity. Today's strong economy means stronger families. And we affirm the woman who chooses to work in the home. But our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions of women, and let me say to the women of America: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also ask you to have an open mind. You know better then anyone that a job _ a good job _ is absolutely basic to a family's happiness and stability. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.'') In the past eight years, President Reagan has created an incredible jobs machine _ more jobs for more Americans than ever before. And two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs created since 1982 went to women. Good jobs, not bad jobs. Real work, not make work. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.'') You did it. You were the expansion. You, the women of America _ who are holding jobs as never before, who've started businesses as never before, who have invested as never before. This expansion _ it's your triumph. But it was Ronald Reagan and George Bush who set in motion the forces which allowed that growth to occur and the economy to bloom. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.'') America is on a roll. If this great <b> economic </b> upsurge is stopped, if we have a President who raises taxes again and in creases regulation again and stifles growth again _ and believe me, that's what Michael Dukakis will do _ if we let the liberals back in, we lose all that progress _ your progress. </p> 0.331933696413048  \n",
              "   American officials plan to file a formal protest over Swiss security officers who jabbed a U.S. diplomat with a machine gun and roughed up a news photographer traveling with President Bush in Geneva. ``It's so strange - supposedly a peace-loving nation gave us the most vicious treatment I've ever seen,'' White House press <b> secretary </b> Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One en route home from Switzerland. Fitzwater said the U.S. government would file a formal protest over a number of incidents that occurred when Bush arrived in Geneva for a three-hour stop and again on departure. He also said White House chief of staff John Sununu was ``verbally attacked'' when he complained. ``I've never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a security force in the last 10 years,'' Fitzwater said. American chief of protocol Joseph Reed was poked in the abdomen with a machine gun in one of the airport incidents. Fitzwater said Reed would summon Swiss Ambassador Edouard Brunner and lodge a formal protest next week after Bush returns from a trip to Mexico. ``They pulled a machine gun on Ambassador Reed ... and verbally attacked the chief of staff (Sununu),'' Fitzwater said. Officers clashed with newsmen and photographers in the president's party on arrival in Geneva, pushing and shoving them as they sought to approach the ramp on which Bush would leave the plane. Fitzwater said that at a hotel in Geneva later Sununu brought up the airport incident with the chief of security. He said Sununu was met with verbal abuse. Guards lined up shoulder to shoulder prevented reporters and photographers from approaching the president's ramp on departure. No one could see Bush at the base of the ramp, though he and Mrs. Bush were visible when they climbed the ramp to board the aircraft. White House press aides tried to get the Swiss officers to move out of the way, and a shouting match followed. It was then that Jerome Delay, a Washington-based photographer for the French news agency Agence France-Presse, was roughed up and the machine gun shoved into Reed's abdomen, Fitzwater said. Reed was trying to reboard the plane, Fitzwater said. There was no immediate word on whether Delay was hurt. The Washington bureau of the news agency said it had no word of any injuries. Fitzwater said he had not discussed the incident with Bush. There was no answer at the Swiss embassy in Washington Friday night. No separate number is listed for the ambassador. </p> 0.312993868213452  \n",
              "   The emerging Bush <b> administration </b> includes prominent holdovers from the Reagan years, but with one clear and important difference: The new team is tilted far more toward pragmatists than ideologues. Bush filled three more key positions Monday and his choices were sure to set off cries of anguish from the right. Dick Thornburgh will remain attorney general and Lauro Cavazos will stay on as education secretary. Both men were late-comers to the Reagan <b> administration </b> and both replaced leading ideologues, Edwin Meese III and William Bennett. The third Bush choice was Richard Darman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget. ``He's put together an Eastern establishment Republican administration,'' said conservative activist Richard Viguerie. ``That's discouraging.'' High-profile jobs in the next <b> administration </b> are rapidly being filled, and only one Bush choice has drawn applause from conservatives _ Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire who will serve as White House chief of staff. The voting machines had hardly stopped humming with Bush's 40-state Election Day victory when the president-elect made the most obvious choice for his new <b> administration </b> _ friend, adviser and campaign chairman James A. Baker III to succeed George Shultz as <b> secretary </b> of state. During his tenure as White House chief of staff Baker earned a reputation as a quintessential pragmatist, a savvy insider who repeatedly gave low priority to the initiatives of the more ideological elements in the Reagan administration. Calls on Reagan to fire Baker were always sure applause lines at conservative gatherings. Baker's deputy was Darman. Quick to follow the Baker selection was that of another old Bush friend and adviser, Nicholas Brady. He will remain treasury secretary. In fact, another characteristic of the Bush appointees is how many have long-standing ties to the president-elect. When Ronald Reagan was filling out his <b> administration </b> eight years ago, he was meeting many of the top officials for the first time. The same was true of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. Not so with Bush. His relationships with the people he has appointed goes back many years. That should not be surprising, considering the years Bush has served in governmental and party posts. The long resume he touted during the presidential campaign put him in close contact with other up-and-coming Republicans. No one ever described Bush as an ideologue and, clearly, the people he feels most comfortable with are as pragmatic as he. It's always tough to get the jump on a new <b> president </b> and name his Cabinet for him. But so far there have been no big surprises, no choices from other than the names subject to the most speculation. The names being mentioned for the remaining national security jobs are former Texas Sen. John Tower for Defense and Brent Scowcroft for national security adviser or CIA director. Scowcroft was national security adviser to President Ford and is an establishment figure. One conservative favorite whose name is frequently mentioned for a Cabinet post is former New York Rep. Jack Kemp. But Kemp is most often mentioned as either Labor or Housing secretary, the two areas where he is least-stringently ideological. The former Buffalo congressman has always enjoyed good relations with traditionally Democratic unions and his major urban initiative is a proposal for enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate in neighborhoods with high unemployment. Neither post would make Kemp a major player in areas where his more ideological views on monetary and tax policy would have influence. Bush may yet come up with some appointees who will please hard-line conservatives, but there is no sign of a Bennett, a James Watt or a Donald Hodel waiting in the wings. </p> 0.288170522493812  \n",
              "   President Bush complained testily Thursday about news accounts which he said portrayed him as deceptive, declaring he would hold fewer news conferences and initiate a ``new approach'' toward reporters. ``From now on, it's going to be a little different. ... So we've got a new relationship,'' Bush told reporters traveling with him aboard Air Force One to the four-nation Colombia drug summit. ``It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it's different,'' said the president, who has averaged one question and answer session with reporters each week since taking <b> office </b> 13 months ago. Later, Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the <b> president </b> was ``just kidding'' in asserting that he would have fewer news conferences and in declining comment on a series of questions. ``He was having fun,'' Fitzwater said. The president, who apparently read a wire service account of his testy mood on the plane, protested to reporters later: ``I'm not fuming.'' Bush's pique apparently was triggered by an ABC-TV report Wednesday night recapping instances in which Bush's words were belied by subsequent events. The <b> president </b> was criticized on the same score in a Feb. 26 article in The New Republic entitled, ``The Deceiving Line.'' Most recently Bush told a news conference on Monday that it wasn't time yet for a conference among the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France on the future status of Germany. ``Not at this juncture,'' he told the news conference. Yet, the next day, a major agreement was announced in Ottawa by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a German reunification push that would include a <b> summit </b> among the four powers that vanquished Germany in World War II. ``When I told you ... that I didn't think there'd be a deal and there shortly was a deal, then I'm hit for deceiving you,'' Bush groused Thursday. Bush, a onetime CIA director, has conducted much of his foreign policy in secrecy. Two missions to China by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft came despite a Bush announcement in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown that he was barring high-level exchanges between the two countries. The <b> president </b> later insisted that Scowcroft's trips to Beijing were ``visits'' and not ``exchanges,'' and thus not covered by the Bush edict. Bush, who usually maintains a bantering relationship with reporters, said, ``I think we've had too many press conferences. It overdoes it. It's overexposure.'' By answering few questions directly, he said, ``I'm not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive.'' The president, who slept the night before on Air Force One so he would be well-rested for Thursday's pre-dawn flight here, even gave a prickly response when asked if he had gotten a good night's sleep. ``I had a very good night's sleep. I can't get into the details of that because some will say it's too much sleep, some will say it's too little. ...,'' he said. Bush parried a series of questions from reporters, most of them dealing with the drug summit. ``I'm not going to discuss what I'm going to bring up,'' Bush said when asked about his agenda for the day's conference in Cartagena with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. ``I'm not going to discuss whether there's any surprises or not. This is a new thing. This is a new approach.'' He then said his non-answers were ``a trial run'' for later dealings with the media. In fact, Bush, who answers reporters questions about once a week, planned to finish his day in Colombia with yet another news conference. Bush's comments with reporters came shortly before his jet touched down here, where a U.S. press center was set up at the airport. Bush flew by helicopter the 60 miles to Cartagena and was returning here before flying home to Washington. Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio Barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to extradite them to the United States if they turned over drug labs, Bush snapped: ``I have no comment whatsoever on that. I have no comment on whether I know about it or not. I can't comment on whether it's true or not.'' Bush did not mention which particular news reports had irked him the most. However, Thursday's editions of the Washington Post had a story on what it called ``the debate between President Bush and the press over secrecy and deception.'' And ABC-TV had a news report on Wednesday night by White House correspondent Brit Hume on the same subject. Hume was one of several reporters invited to a recent off the record lunch at the White House with Bush, at which the subject reportedly came up. News accounts said that Bush told the reporters at the lunch that he had undertaken no further secret diplomatic missions _ like Scowcroft's clandestine visits to China. Then, the next day, it was disclosed that Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger had gone on a secret mission to London to notify U.S. allies of Bush's latest plan to reduce troops in Europe. Bush also gave what some have seen as misleading comments on his surprise seaside <b> summit </b> at Malta in December with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The <b> president </b> in September had said that there were no plans for a superpower <b> summit </b> before 1990, but he later revealed that the session had been arranged as early as last July. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Irving Bank Corp. is backing a sweetened merger <b> offer </b> from Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, which rival Bank of New York Corp. contends is still inferior to its own hostile bid. Irving said on Tuesday that its management had negotiated an amendment to the outstanding <b> offer </b> by Banca Commerciale, Italy's second largest bank, for 51 percent of Irving's common <b> stock </b> to include a dividend in the form of <b> stock </b> warrants to Irving shareholders. Irving said the sweetened <b> offer </b> made the overall transaction worth at least $79.50 per share, which the bank holding <b> company's </b> <b> board </b> of directors deemed superior to Bank of New York's ``best and final bid.'' Under a complex restructuring plan that also would include the <b> sale </b> of assets and a special cash dividend, Banca Commerciale has offered $80 cash a <b> share </b> for 51 percent of Irving's common stock, or a total of about $760 million. The new <b> agreement </b> also provides for Irving to distribute a dividend in the form of <b> stock </b> warrants to all Irving shareholders before the Banca Commerciale tender offer. The warrants, one for every four <b> shares </b> of Irving stock, would have a term of seven years and an exercise price of $65 per <b> share </b> of Irving stock. The new <b> deal </b> means Banca Commerciale would be offering the same amount of money for Irving <b> shares </b> even though the <b> shares </b> would be worth less to the Italian bank because of the distribution by Irving. Irving said BCI's financial adviser, Lazard Freres & Co., put the value of the warrants to shareholders at $4 to $7 per <b> share </b> of Irving common stock. Irving <b> stock </b> closed at $71.37{ per share, up 12{ cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday. Bank of New York rose $1.25 per <b> share </b> to $36.12{. Bank of New York responded that its <b> bid </b> for all of Irving's <b> stock </b> remained superior. Owen Brady, a spokesman for Bank of New York, said BNY's financial adviser Morgan Stanley & Co. projected that if Irving <b> stock </b> sold for $45 a <b> share </b> after a merger with BCI, the warrants effectively would add no more than $1.35 per <b> share </b> in value to BCI's previous offer. Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 <b> shares </b> of its own <b> stock </b> for each of Irving's common <b> shares </b> outstanding. The <b> offer </b> is valued at around $68 a <b> share </b> or $1.2 billion. Bank of New York has offered to sweeten its <b> offer </b> by slightly raising the <b> stock </b> portion of the <b> bid </b> and adding other shareholder incentives, including a special cash dividend, if Irving agreed to abandon its anti-takeover ``poison pill.'' The <b> company </b> also has gone to court seeking to remove the defensive mechanism, which would make an unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive. Irving steadfastly has rejected Bank of New York's <b> takeover </b> advances, which surfaced last September. Estimates of the value of the offers have differed widely. The Irving <b> board </b> said analyses by its advisers, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc., said the Banca Commerciale <b> offer </b> was worth $74 to $79.50 a share. Robert Felise, an executive vice president at Irving, said a separate analysis by Lazard Freres valued the sweetened BCI <b> offer </b> at $80 or more per share. BCI's advisers valued the Bank of New York <b> offer </b> at $72 to $77 a share. </p> 0.708517320038874  \n",
              "   Santa Fe Pacific Corp. has <b> announced </b> it will split into three independent entities on Dec. 4. in a move it says will benefit shareholders. The railroad, energy and real-estate conglomerate said Monday that its <b> board </b> of directors approved a previously <b> announced </b> plan to spin off Santa Fe Energy Resources and Catellus Development Corp., formerly Santa Fe Pacific Realty, to shareholders. Santa Fe stockholders of record as of Nov. 29 will receive a special, tax-free dividend consisting of one <b> share </b> of common <b> stock </b> of Santa Fe Energy Resources for every 3.3 <b> shares </b> of Santa Fe Pacific held, and one <b> share </b> of Catellus for every 4 <b> shares </b> of Santa Fe Pacific.

The spinoffs will leave the Chicago-based parent <b> company </b> with three interests: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and a 44 percent stake in Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines. Santa Fe <b> announced </b> in April its plan to spin off the Houston-based energy and San Francisco-based real-estate units as part of a far-reaching restructuring program begun in 1987. Chairman Robert Krebs said in a statement that the values of Santa Fe's diversified assets have not been reflected in Santa Fe's <b> stock </b> price. Santa Fe Pacific <b> stock </b> closed 25 cents lower at $13 a <b> share </b> Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. ``Our stockholders should benefit from this separation because it will place a spotlight on the values inherent in those companies,'' he said. ``In addition, the directors, management and employees of all three <b> companies </b> will now be able to focus their energies on better utilizing and developing their assets,'' he said. Santa Fe previously sold 18.3 percent of Santa Fe Energy Resources to the public. Its <b> stock </b> is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Santa Fe also has sold a 20 percent stake in the real-estate subsidiary to a limited partnership formed by JMB Realty Corp. and the California Public Employees Retirement System.

              "   Societe Generale de Belgique SA said Thursday it is ready to continue talks with Robert Maxwell that could result in the British publisher gaining a stake in Belgium's largest holding company. Maxwell and Societe Generale agreed in June to cooperate in creating a joint venture in communications, and the two sides had broached the possibility of Maxwell acquiring <b> shares </b> in Societe Generale. But the negotiations were interrupted when Maxwell turned his attention to Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publishing and information services <b> company </b> he has offered to acquire for $2.47 <b> billion </b> in cash. This week Macmillan agreed to a $2.5 <b> billion </b> cash-and-securities buyout by the investment <b> firm </b> Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., but Maxwell said he was mulling his options. On Wednesday, Maxwell said he remained interested in acquiring a stake in Societe Generale and that talks may resume soon. A spokesman for Societe Generale said, ``We continue to be interested in having more international shareholders.''

              "   British publisher Robert Maxwell said Friday he will launch a $2.1 <b> billion </b> cash tender <b> offer </b> for Macmillan Inc. next week, but made clear his main interest is acquiring its information services business. Macmillan already is the subject of a $1.9 <b> billion </b> <b> bid </b> from Robert M. Bass Group Inc., a Texas-based investment group. In a letter to Macmillan, Maxwell said he would drop his $80-a-share tender <b> offer </b> if Macmillan would <b> sell </b> him the information company, which Macmillan proposed to separate from its publishing <b> business </b> in a corporate restructuring. Maxwell said his Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC would be willing to pay ``not less than $1.1 billion'' in cash for the information business, noting that Macmillan's investment bankers had valued it at ``a range of $800 million to slightly in excess of $1 billion.'' In the letter, Maxwell also told Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans he was ``willing to explore other forms of transactions with you'' that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold a significant stake in the company. Maxwell also reitereated he wanted to retain Macmillan management. Macmillan declined to comment on Maxwell's proposals. On Wall Street, the price of Macmillan <b> stock </b> rose $1.50 a <b> share </b> to $83.25, indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate. ``Some people suggested Maxwell isn't serious, but by launching a tender <b> offer </b> at $80 a <b> share </b> on Monday, we see he is serious,'' said Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing <b> business </b> for the brokerage Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. But Boksen said by making the alternate suggestion that he be sold the information assets, Maxwell ``identified the piece he is most interested in.'' ``I think Macmillan is backed up against the wall and will try to find a white knight,'' he said. He said Macmillan could be worth $90 a share. The overture from Maxwell came only three days before a scheduled court hearing in Delaware on whether Macmillan should be allowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring. The restructuring, <b> announced </b> in late May, would split the <b> company </b> into separate publishing and information services concerns and pay shareholders a special dividend of $52.35 a <b> share </b> in cash. That plan was advanced after the Bass Group proposed to pay $64 a <b> share </b> for the Macmillan <b> stock </b> it did not already own. The Bass Group subsequently sweetened its <b> offer </b> twice, and launched its own tender <b> offer </b> for Macmillan at $75 a share. The Bass Group won an order from Delaware Chancery Court blocking Macmillan from proceeding with its restructuring. Macmillan appealed the decision to Delaware Supreme Court, which scheduled a hearing for Monday. Maxwell disclosed his interest in Macmillan in mid-July, saying he would be interested in paying $80 a <b> share </b> for its 25.9 million <b> shares </b> in a friendly transaction. A Maxwell spokesman said Friday that the tender <b> offer </b> at that price would commence on Monday. It is contingent on dropping the restructuring plan, among other things, but Maxwell said it is not conditioned upon obtaining necessary financing. Late last month, the Macmillan <b> board </b> rejected the $75 a <b> share </b> <b> offer </b> from Bass as inadequate, but took no position on the Maxwell proposal. Macmillan spokesman David Jackson refused Friday to comment on whether the <b> board </b> has since met to discuss the Maxwell proposal, or anything else. Maxwell has vowed to make Maxwell Communications one of the world's biggest media and communications businesses. Through that <b> company </b> and Pergamon Press, Maxwell controls the Mirror Group of newspapers in Great Britain, is one of America's largest printers of magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishing academic and scientific journals. </p> 0.628296633386678  \n",

Molson Cos. Ltd., a diversified Canadian company, also said Monday that it did not have any interest in acquiring Payless after examining public information about the company.

Ward White owns the third-largest building materials retailing chain in the United Kingdom. The Edelman-Sutherland group is Payless' largest shareholder with 8.1 percent of the stock. It had said for weeks that it is interested in acquiring Payless, but has not made a formal offer.

Justice Department spokesman Tom Stewart said the agency's public integrity section had received the <b> case </b> and that ``they deal in bringing criminal charges, if necessary.'' ``I would not want you to think that something is imminent,'' he said. The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that the Justice Department was considering bringing criminal charges against the nine CIA employees, who discovered the rare stamps in the agency's supplies and sold them.

The public integrity section is debating whether to bring charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against the employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 $1 stamps bearing an upside-down candlestick with a sheet of stamps that did not have the rare error, the newspaper said.

              "   One or more people associated with Jimmy Swaggart Ministries could be targets of a reopened <b> investigation </b> into the slaying of a woman who left part of her estate to the television evangelist's ministry. Vic Feazell, McLennan County district attorney, said Sunday his <b> office </b> is re-examining Ida Lee Baugh's slaying in December 1983 and that a National Enquirer reporter's new <b> information </b> could help him resolve ``unanswered questions.'' Feazell said the inquiry was not aimed at Swaggart but could involve ``one or more individuals connected with the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at that time.'' ``What we are looking into right now is the possibility of violations of the Texas Penal Code that could include being a party to murder,'' Feazell said. Jacqueline Euna Warren was convicted in April 1984 of murder in the <b> case </b> and sentenced to 99 years in prison. Mrs. Baugh, 70, of McGregor, was found stabbed and beaten and died later at a Waco hospital. Her husband, Maurice Patrick Baugh, died of heart failure five days later. In their will, the couple left all but 25 percent of their cash, not to exceed $25,000, to the ministry in Baton Rouge, La. A Swaggart spokesman estimated the couple's total estate at between $500,000 and $800,000. Baugh's son contested the will, charging that associates of Jimmy Swaggart ministries exercised undue influence on his parents to change their will. Larry Neale Baugh alleged that two men working on behalf of Swaggart Ministries had recommended that Ms. Warren take care of Mrs. Baugh. Later, Larry Baugh dropped his charges. The Waco Tribune-Herald quoted a source familiar with the <b> case </b> as saying a settlement was reached between Baugh and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. Feazell said a National Enquirer reporter approached him with new <b> information </b> he had developed independently. ``The <b> information </b> was believeable and parts of it have been substantiated,'' he said. Feazell said his <b> office </b> had investigated a possible connection between the murder, the will and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at the time of Ms. Warren's trial. ``Lot of <b> questions </b> came to light in the spring of 1984 _ unanswered <b> questions </b> that weren't pursued,'' he said. ``I met with Jimmy Swaggart's attorneys at that time. After meeting with him, I decided to take no further action,'' he said. Feazell said that ``as material becomes available, it could be presented to the grand jury'' during the next few weeks. ``It might be something we can wrap up rather quickly, or we could take a long time with it.'' </p> 0.325335618730338  \n",
              "   A businessman with ties to the Iran-Contra affair has been sentenced to two years probation for his role in a conspiracy to sell confidential Ashland Oil Inc. <b> documents </b> to Iran. U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum on Monday also ordered Roy M. Furmark, a private consultant in the oil industry, to <b> pay </b> Ashland $15,000 in restitution. Furmark pleaded guilty in March to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Furmark, of Brooklyn, testified to Congress in 1987 that he was <b> involved </b> in the sale of American arms to Iran. In the Ashland case, Furmark cooperated with prosecutors for more than a year before his plea and helped implicate former Ashland chairman Orin E. Atkins in the conspiracy. On Friday, Atkins, who also pleaded guilty to conspiracy, was sentenced to two years probation and 600 hours of community service for his role in the scheme. Furmark admitted that he agreed to help Atkins arrange meetings with representatives of the Iranian National Oil Co., which was contemplating a <b> lawsuit </b> against Ashland for the company's decision not to <b> pay </b> $283 million for crude oil purchased in 1979. Atkins has said he wanted to sell to the Iranians confidential <b> documents </b> involving the disputed oil deal that he obtained after he was forced to resign as chairman in 1981 but remained as a paid Ashland consultant. While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued Ashland and last year obtained a $325 million settlement, which with interest was worth more than $500 million. ``This episode in my life has been totally uncharacteristic to my life and what I stand for,'' Furmark told Cedarbaum. ``I am deeply sorry.'' Cedarbaum said she considered Furmark's cooperation in deciding his sentence. Furmark set up a meeting with Atkins in 1988 where they discussed renewed efforts to sell the <b> documents </b> Iran. A videotape of that meeting made by investigators led to charges against Atkins. </p> 0.31321698051303  \n",

Named as defendants in the Christian County Circuit Court <b> lawsuit </b> were CSX Corp. and a subsidiary, CSX Transportation Inc. The complaint alleges negligence on the part of both companies, said Tim Futrell, attorney for the nine plaintiffs, residents of the Crofton and Nortonville areas. ``We are talking in terms of hundreds of millons of dollars in damages,'' Futrell said. ``Under the rules of civil procedure, you are not permitted to specify a specific amount in the complaint.'' Futrell said he believed at least 15,000 people could be affected by the case, noting that the accident on June 22 drove about that many people from their homes in seven western Kentucky counties. Lloyd Lewis, spokesman for CSX Transportation, said Tuesday he had no comment. A CXS Transportation tanker carrying phosphorus was among 34 that left the tracks in a ravine near Crofton. The phosphorus spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned more than 12 hours after the crash. There was no fatalities. Futrell said one of the ``reasons we are filing so quickly is because CSX has dispatched representatives to the area to get people to sign releases for a pittance of what they are due.'' Futrell said some people complained about scratching and itching and difficulty in breathing, and he said there was damage to tobacco and hay crops ``and perhaps to the soil itself.'' ``Virtually all of the plaintiffs were displaced for at least three days.

              "   The company that prepares most of the nation's bar exams <b> filed </b> a federal <b> lawsuit </b> Friday accusing a preparation service of stealing <b> questions </b> and undermining the integrity of the tests. The <b> lawsuit </b> was <b> filed </b> by the National Conference of Bar Examiners, or NCBE, a Chicago company that prepares the Multistate Bar Examination _ 200 multiple-choice <b> questions </b> administered to law graduates in 46 states. The <b> suit </b> accuses Multistate Legal Studies Inc. of Philadelphia and Santa Monica, Calif., of sending agents to purposely fail the bar exam, giving them the right to review the tests. While reviewing the exams, the agents memorized, photographed, hand copied or tape recorded the questions, according to the lawsuit. The <b> suit </b> names Multistate president Robert Feinberg as an agent. Feinberg, an attorney living in California, denied the <b> allegations </b> and noted that his company won a similar <b> suit </b> <b> filed </b> in 1978. The NCBE <b> claims </b> the ``integrity and quality of the process by which applicants are admitted to the practice of law'' was tainted by Multistate, which also operates under the name of Preliminary Multistate Bar Review. The <b> suit </b> seeks unspecified damages as well as injunctions against further copyright infringement. According to the suit, about 100,000 students in 40 states have enrolled in the courses with Preliminary Multistate Bar Review since 1977. The three- and six-day seminars cost $295 to $495 with an additional $395 for written materials, $100 for cassette tapes and about $50 for flashcards. The Multistate Bar Exam, used since 1972, is given twice a year on six subjects. About 58,000 applicants took the exam last year. Questions are prepared by committees of practitioners, judges and law professors and reviewed by others at a cost of about $250,000 per test form. The NCBE releases 50 <b> questions </b> to the public every other year, but does not reuse released questions. The NCBE also prepares other portions of the test, including a essay section and a section on professional responsibility.

              "   Fish farmers don't believe their crops are for the birds, but try telling that to a hungry duck, blackbird or heron. ``Birds are a costly problem where <b> fish </b> are cultured,'' says researcher Vickie D. Martin in a new Agriculture Department report. ``Waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of <b> fish </b> at aquacultural facilities include diving ducks, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, kingfishers, blackbirds, ospreys and anhingas.'' These <b> birds </b> _ the diving ducks include grebes, cormorants and mergansers _ were described as ``voracious <b> fish </b> eaters'' that not only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to <b> fish </b> stock. ``Due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the <b> fish </b> they consumed are diseased, predatory <b> birds </b> may transmit diseases from pond to pond,'' she said. Moreover, when <b> fish </b> farmers attempt to guard against the airborne marauders, they can be frustrated because a majority of the <b> birds </b> are legally categorized as migratory and are protected under federal and <b> state </b> laws. Martin, a student at Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga., worked as an intern for the department's Economic Research Service the last two summers. Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by <b> fish </b> species and location, she said losses to <b> birds </b> have been reported on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical <b> fish </b> and trout, and are greatest in the largest aquaculture states: Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California and Georgia. ``Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the summer,'' Martin said. ``In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers, herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late <b> summer </b> and early fall.'' She added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to shellfish, although swans occasionally are problems. ``Catfish in the Southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas (locally called <b> water </b> turkeys) and kingfishers during the spring and <b> summer </b> months,'' Martin said. ``Herons and cormorants cause problems year-round. Crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by purple grackles, herons, egrets, ibises, gulls, diving ducks and kingfishers.'' Fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as perimeter fencing, netting, overhead wires and other devices, including fireworks, exploders and similar items used to frighten birds. Some chemicals, such as Avitrol, a registered ``frightening agent'' for use on herring gulls and blackbirds, have also been effective, she said. But <b> state </b> and federal permits are required to use this chemical on gulls, because they are legally protected. After ingesting the chemical, the gull ``will behave erratically and emit distress calls,'' which frighten away the other birds, she said. Some migratory game <b> birds </b> may be shot during the hunting season, and other permits are available for some species. Local <b> state </b> and federal <b> wildlife </b> authorities should be contacted. Still, Martin said, some <b> fish </b> farmers believe ``birds are uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile, no matter what method of control of prevention is used.'' </p> 0.533946644642189  \n",
              "   Wood storks have come home to roost in southern Florida, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered <b> birds </b> won't have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season. Summer deluges at the storks' two major ancestral breeding grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the <b> fish </b> the <b> birds </b> rely on for food, they explained. Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, a National Audubon Society refuge about 20 miles <b> north </b> of Naples that was once the primary stork-nesting area in North America. Another 75 pairs have taken up residence at Everglades National Park's Cuthbert Island. The two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by North America's sole species of stork, a giant white bird with an iron-black head. ``We are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers,'' said Paul Hinchcliff, chief naturalist at Corkscrew. ``Whether or not there's enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge enough young remains to be seen.'' Almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have ended disastrously, said John Ogden, who heads a wood stork study team at Everglades National Park. If they are unable to feed offspring, parent <b> birds </b> will abandon the colony, leaving hundreds of crying young <b> birds </b> to starve. Wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers at Corkscrew since 1984-85, when 353 pairs of <b> birds </b> successfully raised 530 young. Fifty years ago, it was common to see 6,000 to 8,000 pairs of storks nesting in the gray-boughed cypress trees. Since the early 1960s, however, storks have been spurning Corkscrew in favor of central and northern Florida and other Southern states. Between 1960 and 1980, the wood stork nesting population at Corkscrew dropped by 75 percent. The renewed Corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the total U.S. stork population, estimated at 4,000. Historically, storks came to Corkscrew by the tens of thousands to nest in early winter, leaving plenty of time to rear offspring before the onset of rain. But human activity disrupted the annual cycle of high-water summers and low-water winters in Florida's wetlands. Much of the area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions. The <b> birds </b> have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the deeper waters of the <b> interior </b> Everglades to drop low enough for them to efficiently feed. As result, nesting is delayed, and this year's young won't be ready to leave their nests until about mid-July, Ogden said. </p> 0.474262413270188  \n",

              "   Wilfred LePage saw his first zebra mussel Feb. 1. By September, thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the <b> water </b> treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly sparking a <b> water </b> emergency. ``There is no cheap solution to it and there's no real cure to the problem,'' said LePage, <b> water </b> treatment superintendent in Monroe, Mich., on Lake Erie's <b> western </b> edge. At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December's deep freeze stopped them from clogging <b> water </b> intakes but they quickly settled inside the plant. ``They like it where it's dimly lit, they like it where it's warm, and they don't like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal for them,'' said Robert C. Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at the plant. ``By July, we're going to have a massive problem with them.'' Three years after they were introduced to North America and after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread throughout the <b> lake </b> and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It's an invasion scientists say could affect farming, <b> fishing </b> and daily life along virtually every body of fresh <b> water </b> in North America in the next few years. The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love intake pipes of <b> water </b> and power plants because the current brings them a steady supply of fresh food. A mussel can filter more than a gallon of <b> water </b> an hour, said R. Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave <b> water </b> cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would certainly be a benefit, I guess,'' he said. Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds, and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said Charles O'Neill, with the Sea Grant program at the State University College at Brockport. The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, Flint said. But with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they could deplete the supply for the small <b> fish </b> that support the billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry. And the bad news could spread beyond the <b> lake </b> and its shoreline. Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation <b> water </b> from the lakes can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because of the shells, O'Neill said. ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet to the <b> water </b> at your tap,'' O'Neill said. ``It's not just an environmental problem.'' Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in theory, to be edible by humans, Flint said. But when Canadian researchers tried steaming a bunch, O'Neill said, ``What they got was a stench that cleared the lab.'' The mussels have plagued Europe for more than a century and are believed to have arrived in North America on a freighter that emptied its ballast tanks in Lake St. Clair, upstream from Lake Erie, in 1986. Scientists are studying the possibility that the Lake Erie infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986 event, O'Neill said. But Flint said one colony could have infested the <b> lake </b> because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells. ``They could easily get across Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in that period of time,'' he said. For public <b> water </b> systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the intake pipe rather than waiting until the <b> water </b> is inside the plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have already faced the problem. Power plants have a different problem, because officials are reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in cooling <b> water </b> discharged back to the lake, Henderson said. Niagara Mohawk and the <b> state </b> Department of Environmental Conservation are negotiating a solution. James Sell, chief operator of the Dunkirk <b> water </b> plant, is studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe's mouth, like building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine pipe out through the intake. ``We're better off than the people in the <b> western </b> end of the lake,'' Sell said. ``At least we have some time to do something by spring.'' The City Council hasn't been persuaded to pay up to $100,000 for the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to show visitors, said, ``I don't see much option for them if they want a <b> water </b> supply.'' Farther inland, many <b> water </b> officials are unaware of the problem or not prepared to do anything about it. Michael Burke, director of the <b> state </b> Health Department's bureau of public <b> water </b> supply protection, said the department was studying the problem but doesn't see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word's getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in the Great Lakes. It is coming out in industry papers and things of that sort.'' O'Neill and other scientists said the <b> state </b> should do more to get the word out, because it is only a matter of time _ and not necessarily very much time. ``The chances of them getting into the <b> western </b> reach of the Erie Canal is good,'' O'Neill said. ``The canal is an ideal place for them to live. It's warm. It's shallow. Most of it has rock riprap to attach to.'' Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their engine housings and other places where <b> water </b> collects. Once the mussels get into Lake Michigan, they will almost certainly spread through the Chicago River and into the Mississippi River basin, O'Neill said. ``Any area in North America that is utilizing surface <b> water </b> should be concerned.'' </p> 0.436668989864492  \n",
              "   They could have been cremation pits, cock-fighting rings, animal pens, Civil War foxholes or secret hiding places for moonshine equipment. Maybe they were prehistoric Indian burial sites, charcoal pits or foundations for native American abodes. Or maybe, some say, the <b> stone </b> circles dotting the <b> western </b> slope of Polish Mountain encircled apple <b> trees </b> in the early 1900s. For more than a decade, 150 to 200 circles of sandstone rock have puzzled area residents and archaelogists. Virtually hidden by brush and poison ivy, the gray-colored rocks of various shapes and sizes are neatly arranged in circles. No one knows their purpose, or who put them there. ``Everybody that goes up there has some kind of weird theory,'' said John Mash, manager of Green Ridge State Forest, where the circles are found. ``One guy even mentioned that they could have been sweat lodges _ like a Turkish bath. ``The Indians would have these rituals when they would go into manhood,'' he said. ``They would go in these buildings with hot rocks and put <b> water </b> on them _ something like a sauna.'' But 150 to 200 saunas on one hillside in <b> western </b> Maryland? Mash said rangers noticed the <b> stone </b> rings in the early 1970s. In 1975, Mash contacted State Archaeologist Tyler J. Bastian, who visited the site and put the circles on a list of archaeological areas in Maryland. But it was not until last year that some archaelogists and volunteers excavated one of the circles. ``They did the dig and <b> found </b> zip, except for the rattlesnakes,'' Mash said. Hoping to uncover clues, another group conducted a dig this spring. ``In a nutshell, we didn't discover anything. They still remain a mystery,'' said Charles McVeigh Jr., a member of the Western Maryland Archaeological Society. ``We dug out in the center of them. We didn't go down very far before we got to bedrock. We <b> found </b> no artifacts. We <b> found </b> nothing to indicate prehistoric use.'' No future digs are planned, and two local archaeologists who took an interest in the circles, Robert D. Wall and Connie Huddleston, both have moved from Maryland. Neither could be reached for comment recently. Meanwhile, the <b> state </b> forest has put the circles on its historic preservation list to ensure the five-acre tract remains untouched, Mash said. The site could be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places if additional information could be <b> found </b> to document the age of the rings, their use and significance. Mash has dismissed the moonshine theory because there is no nearby <b> water </b> source needed to make moonshine. He said he did not think they were cock-fighting rings because only one pit is needed to hold a fight. And the rings are too close together to have been foxholes during the Civil War, he said. ``The site has no strategic value,'' Mash said. ``(And) the guy in the middle foxhole is going to be shooting his own pals before he can get his bullet out to hit the bad guys.'' Until someone conjures up a more believable theory, Mash said he puts the most stock in the orchard theory _ that someone placed the stones around apple <b> trees </b> that once grew in the area. There were 1 million apple <b> trees </b> in Green Ridge by 1914, he said. ``It is possible that they hired immigrants who could not understand directions given in English and some of them were told to clear the rocks away to plant the apple trees,'' he suggested. ``They were new in America and wanted to do a nice, neat job, so they put these rocks in nice neat little circles and left a space in the middle for the tree. And they might have worked on these for a couple of days, or a week until somebody stopped them. That could be a theory ...'' </p> </details> \n",

              "   President Bush has a 56 <b> percent </b> approval rating among blacks, a huge increase over the ratings given former President Reagan, according to a new CBS News-New York Times poll. Only 13 <b> percent </b> of <b> blacks </b> supported Reagan at about the same point in his presidency, CBS Evening News reported Thursday. In May 1982, Reagan had a 73 <b> percent </b> disapproval rating among blacks; in the current poll, 26 <b> percent </b> of <b> blacks </b> surveyed disapproved of Bush, said Kathleen A. Frankovic, of the CBS network's polling division. CBS-Times polls <b> conducted </b> during Reagan's entire time in office <b> found </b> he had an average 67 <b> percent </b> disapproval rating among blacks, Frankovic said. The new <b> survey </b> is the fourth consecutive Times-CBS News <b> poll </b> in the last six months in which a majority of <b> blacks </b> said they approved of Bush's handling of his job, the Times reported in today's editions. For the last 30 years, five out of six <b> blacks </b> have voted for the Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who the nominee was, CBS reported. In the new poll, one out of 10 <b> blacks </b> said they probably would vote for Bush against a Democratic candidate in 1992, while another 20 <b> percent </b> said their <b> choice </b> would depend on who was running, the Times said. One-third of the <b> blacks </b> surveyed, and 46 <b> percent </b> of the whites, said their opinion of Bush had improved since he became president, the Times said. Blacks were evenly divided on whether Bush is doing a good job handling the war on drugs, while whites approved 56 <b> percent </b> to 35 percent, the Times said. White respondents gave Bush an overall approval rating of 75 <b> percent </b> to 14 percent. The telephone <b> poll </b> of 1,515 adult Americans, including 403 blacks, was <b> conducted </b> March 30-April 2.

The new <b> results </b> contrast with a series of <b> surveys </b> in recent weeks indicating Bush trailed Dukakis in double digits. A telephone <b> survey </b> of 1,013 adults last week by ABC News and Money Magazine, <b> released </b> Wednesday, <b> found </b> 45 <b> percent </b> support for Dukakis and 42 <b> percent </b> for Bush. That amounts to a tie, given the <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> of plus or minus 4 <b> percentage </b> points. And a Gallup <b> poll </b> of 1,210 voters, also out Wednesday, suggested Dukakis had the support of 46 percent, to 41 <b> percent </b> for Bush. The <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> was 3 <b> percentage </b> points. By contrast, Gallup, NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Washington Post polls <b> conducted </b> since June 9 have <b> found </b> double-digit leads for Dukakis. The Post survey, done June 15-19, <b> found </b> a 51-39 <b> percent </b> Dukakis margin.

Bush rose only from 41 to 42 <b> percent </b> support; those who didn't know grew from 2 <b> percent </b> to 6 percent. The rest said they wouldn't vote or would support someone else. Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories. A Harris <b> survey </b> early this month <b> found </b> a dead heat _ 49-44, with a 3-point <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> _ and a USA Today-CNN <b> poll </b> gave Dukakis a single-digit lead.

              "   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis begins his race against Republican George Bush with a 12-point advantage, according to an ABC News poll. The network reported Thursday that Dukakis leaped to a 53-41 <b> percent </b> <b> lead </b> in a <b> survey </b> of 450 registered <b> voters </b> Wednesday, up from his 45-46 virtual dead heat with Bush in ABC's <b> poll </b> Sunday. The movement was 13 <b> points </b> _ from 1 point down to 12 up. The jump was expected; polls in other elections have <b> found </b> that nominees often gain support immediately after their party's convention. Such bumps frequently settle back down as <b> voters </b> focus on the substance of the race. The <b> survey </b> reflected the success of Dukakis' peacemaking with Jesse Jackson, his opponent for the nomination. Sixty-eight <b> percent </b> said Dukakis was treating Jackson fairly, up from 52 <b> percent </b> in a <b> poll </b> early this month. Similarly, 70 <b> percent </b> said Jackson was treating Dukakis fairly, and the share of respondents with an unfavorable view of Jackson fell 11 <b> points </b> from Sunday, to 31 percent. Those with a favorable view rose 9 <b> points </b> to 52. The national <b> survey </b> <b> found </b> a rise in unfavorable views of Bush, who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week. His favorable rating fell from 49 <b> percent </b> to 41 percent, while those viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 <b> percent </b> Sunday to 44 <b> percent </b> Wednesday. The poll, completed the day before Dukakis appeared at the convention, <b> found </b> little change in his favorable-unfavorable rating, 55-21. Dukakis' 12-point <b> lead </b> against Bush did not mark his greatest numerical advantage in an ABC poll; the Massachusetts governor led by 53-40 in late May. The <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> for the new <b> poll </b> was 5 points. Such single-day surveys, particularly when <b> conducted </b> during or just after a highly publicized event, tend to measure visceral reactions rther than considered opinion, so the views they gauge can change rapidly. Dukakis continued to do better with women <b> voters </b> than with men, and the <b> poll </b> Wednesday <b> found </b> that he had gained more ground among women _ leading Bush by 25 <b> points </b> in the new poll, up from an 8-point <b> lead </b> Sunday. Dukakis scored a tie with Bush among men, after a 12-point Bush <b> lead </b> Sunday. Dukakis improved with independents, scoring 48-42 against Bush after a 52-35 <b> lead </b> for Bush among independents Sunday. And 59 <b> percent </b> of Democrats who had bolted the party to vote for President Reagan favored Dukakis now. In another measure of the convention's impact, 52 <b> percent </b> said the Democrats could be trusted to do a better job with the nation's problems, up 9 <b> points </b> from Sunday. And 40 <b> percent </b> said they generally approved of the proceedings in Atlanta, while just 13 <b> percent </b> disapproved. Nearly half said they had not been paying enough attention to say. </p> 0.399764014728187  \n",

A few armed policemen entered deserted <b> police </b> stations late <b> today </b> but allowed no one to enter. A 10-hour curfew restricting <b> people </b> to their homes began at 7 p.m. and some policemen in jeeps and trucks patrolled the city. Monday's <b> violence </b> was the worst since April 6, when <b> police </b> opened <b> fire </b> on pro-democracy demonstrators, and threatened the fledgling pro-democracy movement in this Himalayan kingdom. Until this month, King Birendra had exercised virtually absolute power. Five civilians were <b> killed </b> by <b> police </b> gunfire in Monday's unrest and, according to the state-owned Rashtriya Samachar Samiti news agency, 15 policemen were missing. Only one policeman had been found by late today. The mobs accused <b> police </b> of condoning and sometimes joining an underground pro-monarchist group blamed for a wave of crime since a new government headed by pro-democracy forces took office last week. Two policemen captured early Monday were beaten for more than six hours before they died. Four more policemen were dragged from a <b> police </b> station and lynched by hundreds of people. The crowds also set afire the zonal commissioner's office, which houses a <b> police </b> station. Today, two policemen in riot gear stood guard outside the charred building. They were the only policemen seen on foot during an hour-long tour of Katmandu. ``There are no policemen anywhere in the city,'' said a taxi driver who said he had been driving the <b> streets </b> for six hours. ``Even traffic policemen are absent today.'' One government source said the policemen were either ``unofficially withdrawn or are too scared to come out.'' Senior <b> police </b> officials could not be located for comment. But shops opened and <b> streets </b> were clogged with traffic <b> today </b> after a ten-hour curfew clamped on Monday night was lifted at 6 a.m.. There were no reports of violence. ``The tremendous amount of confidence the <b> people </b> have in this government is compensating for the absence of police,'' said Home Minister Yog Prasad Upadhyay. ``This is apparent from the fact that ... the country is peaceful.'' Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai met with King Birendra <b> today </b> to discuss the situation, officials said. No details of the meeting were available. A scheduled meeting of the Cabinet was postponed, officials said on condition of anonymity. There had been indications a shake-up in the top ranks of the <b> police </b> force might be forthcoming after the Cabinet meeting. Bhattarai and his government, a coalition of democrats, Communists, royalists and independents, took office last Thursday after an eight-week campaign against the previous regime, which was subservient to the king. King Birendra caved in to the campaign on April 8, two days after <b> police </b> shot and <b> killed </b> 200 <b> demonstrators </b> as they marched on the palace, according to witnesses. The government said 10 <b> people </b> were <b> killed </b> and 107 wounded in all of Nepal on that day, but two days later Birendra lifted a 29-year ban on political parties. Within 24 hours of the new government taking office, the <b> capital </b> of 250,000 <b> people </b> was faced with a rash of arson, mugging and looting, which residents blamed on a right-wing pro-monarchist group called Mandale.

Two of the <b> students </b> brandishing explosive devices and draped in South Korean flags stood at shattered windows on the second floor yelling ``Yankee go home'' as riot <b> police </b> ringed the building. U.S. Embassy officials said they had no reports of injuries, but the attackers smashed windows and set a <b> fire </b> in a periodical storage room. Thick smoke filled part of the <b> building </b> located in the heart of Seoul. People inside the <b> building </b> at the time of the attack, including at least one American, were not detained by the radicals. The students, who said they were members of the ``Young Student Suicide Group'' claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed at surrounding <b> police </b> to stay away. They tossed down a statement charging the United States was attempting to make South Korea a colony. ``Yankees stay out of Korea,'' the <b> students </b> yelled. A <b> police </b> officer said it was unclear how many of the explosive devices the attackers had. The bombs were crude chemical devices, possibly some kind of plastic explosive, he said. About 200 radical <b> students </b> hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot <b> police </b> about an hour later outside Myungdong Cathedral. Police <b> fired </b> volleys of tear gas at the <b> students </b> who yelled slogans denouncing President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who is to be sworn in Thursday. Hundreds of <b> protesters </b> had gathered at the cathedral less than a mile from the U.S. Information Service office earlier in the afternoon for an anti-government protest. ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,'' the <b> students </b> yelled. Some of the attackers were reading in the office's library when there was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenly pulled out bombs and started screaming slogans, eyewitnesses said. At least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it, they said. ``He was kind of crazy-eyed,'' said Paul Wadden, a visiting American teacher who was reading in the library at the time. The attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main street outside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the street and brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters. Riot <b> police </b> stood on the sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shattered glass covered the street. The <b> students </b> tossed at least one bomb into the street where it exploded harmlessly, eyewitnesses said. A second bomb was tossed out, but did not explode, they said. People caught in the library said the <b> students </b> did not attempt to detain them and they were able to leave after recovering from their initial shock. Wadden said he and other <b> people </b> were prevented from leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by <b> building </b> guards. There were about 40 <b> people </b> in the library at the time, most of them Koreans, eyewitnesses said. Police who entered the <b> building </b> by the rear entrance overpowered the <b> protesters </b> about 30 minutes after the attack began. The <b> students </b> were taken out of the <b> building </b> in a <b> bus </b> with covered windows. U.S. Embassy officials said South Korean riot <b> police </b> entered the <b> building </b> at their request. Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita arrived at the Lotte Hotel across the street from the U.S. Information Service office just as the incident ended, officials said. Takeshita is in Seoul for Roh's inauguration. American diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know why the <b> students </b> attacked the U.S. facility. ``We have no idea what the motivation was,'' an embassy official said. The United States is South Korea's chief ally. Washington has 40,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against communist North Korea. The U.S. Information Service provides reading material and other materials on the United States and operates libraries and information centers around the world in conjunction with American embassies. The service office in Seoul is located about half a mile from the American Embassy. The same office was seized by 73 radical <b> students </b> for four days in May, 1985 as an anti-American protest. They ended the occupation peacefully and some later received prison sentences. U.S. Embassy officials were unable to explain <b> today </b> how the attackers were able to bring weapons into the well-guarded building. Visitors must pass a metal detector, present identification and have their bags searched and there are <b> police </b> guards inside and outside. The statement by the <b> students </b> denounced Roh as a puppet who had been installed by the United States. South Korean radicals have repeatedly charged the United States has kept a series of authoritarian governments in power in South Korea. Roh, a former general, won the first democratic elections in 16 years last December. </p> 0.475636300053292  \n",
              "   Police clashed with about 250 stone-throwing Moslem fundamentalists who attacked a theater troupe, a <b> security </b> source said Wednesday. One student was <b> killed </b> and four were <b> injured </b> as officers dispersed the crowd. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incident took place Tuesday night at the village of Kodeya, 25 miles from the southern provincial <b> capital </b> of Assiut. He said it wasn't known what <b> killed </b> 23-year-old Mohammed Kotb. One of the four wounded <b> students </b> was in critical condition, he added. In a statement read to The Associated Press by telephone, a fundamentalist spokesman claimed the student was <b> killed </b> by <b> police </b> gunfire. ``The Moslem group went out through the village in a peaceful march of <b> protest </b> ... when <b> police </b> attacked them with tear gas and opened <b> fire </b> on the demonstrators, killing the student Mohammed Kotb,'' the statement said. The spokesman, who refused to give his name, said forces then surrounded the village, raided homes and detained fundamentalists. The spokesman said the <b> students </b> were protesting a ``dancing party'' organized by <b> security </b> forces. The <b> security </b> source, however, said the fundamentalists attacked a theater troupe performing a play about Islam and peasants. The troup had been invited to perform by the government's culture club at the village. ``Around 250 Moslem fundamentalists from the village and nearby villages gathered in a mosque after evening prayers and then moved to the hall where the play was being performed, carrying stones and rocks,'' the source said. He said the students, from a teacher training college, ``attacked the hall and tried to destroy the building,'' but <b> security </b> forces surrounded them and used tear gas and sticks to disperse them. He did not say whether <b> police </b> made any arrests. Police forces guarded the <b> building </b> until the play was finished, the source said. The southern Assiut province has been a hotbed of fundamentalist agitation for almost a decade. Fundamentalist <b> students </b> armed with knives, bicycle chains and stones, attacked an Assiut University campus parade on March 7, denouncing it as an anti-Islamic ``dancing and singing party.'' In the ensuing clash with <b> security </b> forces, two <b> students </b> and two policemen were wounded. </p> 0.449178970764982  \n",
              "   Thousands marching against government austerity measures fled in panic Thursday when <b> police </b> <b> fired </b> rifles and tear gas after hooded youths smashed store windows. Three <b> people </b> were injured, <b> police </b> said. The <b> violence </b> came 11 months after rioting left about 300 dead following <b> protests </b> over subsidy cuts on food and public transportation. About 8,000 union members and supporters marched in the <b> capital </b> while thousands of others marched across the country in <b> protest </b> of government reforms aimed at cutting a $34 billion foreign debt, fourth-largest in Latin America. The march in Caracas was interrupted when a group of adolescents overturned garbage cans and shouted insults at police. About 20 of the youths began breaking windows in Simon Bolivar Center, a complex on Plaza Caracas, where the march was to end. Police rushed in firing tear gas and shotgun blasts in the air. Three <b> people </b> were <b> injured </b> in the brief confrontation, including Rafael Calma, a photographer for a Caracas newspaper, hit by a bottle thrown by a bystander in the crowd, said police. Police did not say how the other two <b> people </b> were hurt. ``It was the same group of troublemakers. A small group. We acted responsibly,'' said metropolitan <b> police </b> sheriff L.B. Gomez, standing his ground as <b> protesters </b> chanted, ``Police off our streets! The <b> streets </b> are ours!'' ``It's the fault of the government's economic package,'' said a leftist congressman, Ricardo Guttierez, participating in the march. The march was called by the 4 million-member Confederation of Workers, CTV, Venezuela's largest umbrella labor group. The CTV has called on President Carlos Andres Perez to back off on austerity measures it says has hit poorer Venezuelans the hardest. Labor leaders have planned <b> protests </b> this month after Perez' year-old Social Democratic government planned to cut subsidies on gasoline. The economy last year contracted by 8.1 percent and inflation rose to 80 percent under the effects of the austerity measures. Unemployment is about 11 percent, according to independent estimates, up from 8.7 percent last year. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Two Michigan businessmen and three companies they control pleaded innocent Friday to charges they bilked a Scott Paper Co. mill out of up to $1 million by bribing an engineer and putting his wife on their payroll. Federal prosecutors say Gerald M. Chernow, 49, and William M. Engelman, 52, cheated the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook by persuading maintenance engineer David Hilt to buy unneeded maintenance and roofing equipment that was marked up by up to 20 times its cost. Initially, Hilt was given merchandise, gift certificates and money orders, and later, his wife, Ellen, was put on the payroll of one of the Michigan companies, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Gleason said. Chernow and Engelman, both of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., entered innocent pleas before U.S. Magistrate David Cohen. Chernow and Engelman were freed on their own recognizance, but they must hand over their passports and will be required to pay $50,000 bond if they fail to show up to any court proceedings, Gleason said. The two businessmen had appeared in court without being arrested. The two are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and the use of interstate facilities in furtherance of private bribery. Both businessmen declined to comment on the case, as did defense attorney Julian Sweet of Lewiston. Also named as defendants in the 21-count indictment are Modern Research Corp. and Lincoln Technical Services Inc., both of Troy, Mich., and ABC Chemical Co. of Detroit. If Chernow and Engelman are convicted on all counts, they face up to 105 years in prison and fines totaling $5.25 million each, the prosecutor said. Modern Research and Lincoln Technical Service each face up to $10.5 million in fines, while ABC Chemical could face $6.5 million in fines. Philadelphia-based Scott Paper lost between $750,000 and $1 million in the scheme, the government says. </p> 0.275014308112386  \n",

              "   Members of the ruling Politburo flew to the restive Baltic <b> republics </b> Friday, and one warned residents against pushing too hard for <b> economic </b> and cultural autonomy from Moscow, local journalists reported. Dissatisfaction in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has been fueled by political reforms proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Baltic residents say the changes will void their constitutional right to secede and give Moscow control over their <b> economy </b> and other aspects of life. The Politburo, the Communist Party's supreme body, promised Thursday to hold a discussion on expanding the rights of the 15 constituent Soviet republics. But the dispatching of three of its members to the Baltic region indicated the Kremlin wants to draw the line now on what sort of political changes can be contemplated. The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet parliament is to meet in special session in Moscow on Nov. 29 to approve Gorbachev's blueprint for political change, which also increases the powers of the presidential post and creates a new national legislature. Viktor M. Chebrikov, the former KGB chief who now heads a party Central Committee commission on legal and judicial reform, opposed demands for local <b> economic </b> independence in comments to workers at a plastics factory in Tallinn, Estonia, according to Tarmu Tammerk, an Estonian journalist. ``He said very strong words against <b> economic </b> independence. He said the whole of the Soviet <b> economy </b> is so tightly linked that one cannot speak of independence for one of its parts,'' Tammerk, who works for the newspaper Homeland, said in a telephone interview. Chebrikov's remarks were broadcast on state-run Estonian radio in an attempt to give them the widest possible exposure. ``His words sounded like a grim warning to people here,'' Tammerk said. ``Economic Independence'' has been the watchword of a widespread movement in Estonia called the Popular Front, which seeks greater control by Estonians over the affairs of their Switzerland-sized republic. Estonians say the fruits of their labor are siphoned off by Moscow to subsidize poorer regions of the country, including the giant Russian federation, the largest Soviet republic. Two of Chebrikov's colleagues on the Politburo traveled to the other Baltic states, ideology chief Vadim M. Medvedev to Latvia and Nikolai N. Slyunkov, who is in charge of formulating the party's social and <b> economic </b> policy, to Lithuania. Their arrivals were reported by state-run media in the Baltic republics, journalists there said. Later, the evening television news <b> program </b> Vremya broadcast brief reports on the visits. Tass, the official news agency, said Medvedev outlined limits to political activity in meetings with workers at two factories in Riga, the Latvian capital. Tass said Latvians agreed with Medvedev on the need ``to subordinate group ambitions to the interests of society as a whole in the conditions of perestroika.'' However, during his visit to the Norma factory in Tallinn, Chebrikov heard Estonians object to elements of Gorbachev's political <b> reform </b> plan, Vremya said. The westward-looking Baltic republics, independent states until the Soviet Union absorbed them in 1940, have become a proving ground for bold <b> economic </b> reforms that are part of Gorbachev's drive for ``perestroika'' or restructuring. Granting a greater degree of autonomy to the small <b> republics </b> on the Soviet Union's western edge is fraught with political risks, since many residents resent Moscow's control and some openly say their ultimate desire is complete independence. The Estonian Popular Front and a similar organization in Latvia have condemned Gorbachev's political <b> reform </b> plan, which is embodied in proposed amendments to the 1977 Constitution. The Lithuanian Restructuring Movement is to meet Sunday in Vilnius, the republic's capital, to consider the issue. Members of the three popular fronts are now gathering signatures on petitions asking that the amendments be dropped and rewritten, Algimontas Vaishnoras of the Lithuanian group said in a telephone interview. The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, has scheduled a meeting on the political <b> reform </b> issue for Wednesday, and Lithuania's legislature will meet the next day. The 12-man Politburo, in a report on its Thursday night meeting, said authorities will consider changing the draft constitutional changes in response to more than 80,000 suggestions and comments from citizens and organizations. Friday night the Central Committee announced it would hold a special plenary meeting in mid-1989 to review policies dealing with the country's more than 100 ethnic groups. ``The task of perfecting relations among nationalities is acquiring special importance and urgency,'' a Central Committee statement said according to Tass. </p> 0.40124004566598  \n",
              "   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday night closed a national Communist Party <b> conference </b> on his <b> program </b> of ``perestroika,'' saying resolutions endorsed by the delegates lead the way to a ``democratic image of socialism.'' The four-day conference, the first held by the party since 1941, was unprecedented in the openness of criticism of past and present leaders. Gorbachev pointed out one key to the four-day <b> conference </b> _ the attempt to overcome the party's Stalinist legacy _ when he called for construction of a monument to the victims Josef Stalin. ``I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be constructed in Moscow,'' he said in his closing address. ``This would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire Soviet people.'' Gorbachev spoke after the <b> conference </b> of 5,000 party members adopted resolutions in what the Tass news agency called an ``unusually stormy and long'' debate. The meeting, which was called by Gorbachev to pass judgment on his 3-year-old policy of restructuring Soviet society, formally closed after his address. The Soviet <b> leader </b> also engaged in a long critique of the work of former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, who appealed earlier in the day to the <b> conference </b> to absolve him of blame for criticizing the pace of Gorbachev's reforms last fall. That criticism cost Yeltsin his job and his spot as a candidate member of the ruling Politburo. Summing up the work of the conference, Gorbachev said, ``Through democratization, <b> economic </b> <b> reform </b> and changes in the political system we willmake perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our society, a new human and democratic image of socialism.'' He called for the policy-making Central Committee and other organs to urgently settle questions related to political reforms so they can begin to be implemented at a fall session of the Supreme Soviet. Referring to his proposals to restructure the government's legislative branch and give the president new powers, Gorbachev said ``the <b> conference </b> will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system.'' Tass said the <b> conference </b> adopted a package of six resolutions, saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations and Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or more openness, were particularly thorny. It did not say what the resolutions said. The Tass report said there were several votes on amendments, and that the <b> conference </b> rejected proposals by space scientist Roald Sagdeyev on elections to government councils. An amendment calling for the Communist Party newspaper Pravda to be taken out of the hands of the policy-making Central Committee received only 56 votes, it said. Gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference. ``One of the heroes of our <b> conference </b> was glasnost because our <b> conference </b> was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,'' he said. He called on the Soviet media to ``publicize the real achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,'' and proclaimed that no one has a monopoly on the truth. In an apparent reference to the time of Stalin, he said ``the printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.'' In contrast, he said the <b> conference </b> had showed how the interparty debate must be carried out. Before the <b> conference </b> debate ended, however, the long-simmering feud between Yeltsin and Kremlin No. 2 <b> leader </b> Yegor K. Ligachev broke into the open. Yeltsin was judged as being politically mistaken by the party, but he said Friday his only mistake was poor timing. Gorbachev said Yeltsin was chosen to run the Moscow party organization because of his experience and energy, but ultimately proved he could not handle the job. Ligachev, at whom much of Yeltsin's criticism was leveled, took the floor Friday evening to oppose his return, saying Yeltsin committed many errors and still hadn't learned his lesson. The 57-year-old Yeltsin, a leading reformer and former protege of Gorbachev, was fired from his Moscow job as head of the Moscow Communist Party after he attacked the slow pace of <b> reform </b> during a speech in October to the Central Committee. The speech has not been published. Yeltsin was reassigned as first deputy of the state construction committee, a ministerial-level post. He was dropped from the Politburo in February but retained sufficient status in the party to be chosen a delegate. ``I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early, before the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution,'' Yeltsin said. It was a time when the party was trying to display unity and celebrate its successes. ``Taking to heart what happened, I ask the <b> conference </b> to change the decision of the plenum of the Central Committee,'' Yeltsin told the delegates. ``If you find it possible to do this, you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of Communists.'' Yeltsin took the floor to answer questions from many delegates about the circumstances of his ouster and about his demand that Ligachev resign. He had told Western reporters during the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow that Ligachev was the party official most responsible for holding back Gorbachev's reforms. Ligachev said Yeltsin had ``not drawn the necessary conclusions from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades.'' Other delegates also criticized Yeltsin, charging that he had been tactless on a visit abroad and gave interviews to foreign new agencies just to boost his own prestige. Some rose to Yeltsin's defense in an open debate. Earlier Friday, the nation's top environmental official demanded punishment for planners responsible for pollution disasters, and a reformist publisher defended the new openness of the press. At other times during the conference, delegates have openly disagreed on the concrete results of Gorbachev's drive for perestroika, which was launched after he took power in March 1985. </p> 0.354439941714667  \n",
              "   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has won another political victory, gaining Communist Party approval to restructure the Politburo that once ruled the country. The Politburo now promises to play second fiddle to the separate government structure he also leads. The vote by the 28th Communist Party Congress on Monday also marks a new effort to reduce the ethnic unrest that is tearing the Soviet Union apart by including party leaders from the 15 Soviet <b> republics </b> on the Politburo, the party's ruling inner circle. The new body will have up to 23 members, nearly twice the 12 voting members on the old body, and many if not most of the faces should be new. The expansion and restructuring will accelerate the process that Gorbachev began after he was elected to a strengthened presidency in March, transferring power to a newly created Presidential Council _ a development that has angered such hard-line Politburo members as Yegor K. Ligachev and could squeeze them out of their jobs. Unlike the Politburo, whose members are elected by the party, members of the Presidential Council are appointed and dismissed by the president, along the lines of a Western-style cabinet. The Politburo, which formerly met once every Thursday, has been meeting only once a month since March, and has been concentrating on Communist Party rather than government issues. Since most of the Politburo members will reside in their home republics, the Politburo will continue to meet relatively infrequently and will not exercise as tight control over national affairs as the body has traditionally done. The duties of the government council have not been fully defined. The 16-man body consists of six voting members of the Politburo, including the prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister, the KGB chief, and Gorbachev's right-hand man, Alexander Yakovlev. Other members are the chief law enforcement official, a reform-minded economist, a crusading environmentalist and a workers' rights activist. Significantly, whereas nine of 12 men on the old Politburo were members of the ethnic Russian majority, the new Politburo will include a majority of non-Russians. And the Presidential Council contains five non-Russians. The new Politburo will include the heads of the party organizations in the 15 republics, most of whom are clamoring for greater control over political and <b> economic </b> decisions affecting their regions. Shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist Party five years ago, Gorbachev sought to centralize his authority, but he has been driven to support greater regional autonomy by the independence drives of the three Baltic republics. Moreover, the largest Soviet republic, the Russian Federation, last month proclaimed its intent to seek greater control of its affairs under the leadership of its populist Communist president, Boris N. Yeltsin. Mostly recently, Gorbachev has embraced the idea of reconstituting the Soviet Union as a looser confederation of republics. The Politburo has had its ups and downs since it was created on the eve of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that swept the Communists to power. The first two Soviet leaders, Vladimir I. Lenin and Josef V. Stalin, exercised virtual one man rule, appointing aides and allies to the Politburo. Under Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled for 18 years until his death in 1982, the Politburo was a coalition that made all the key decisions. As Brezhnev and the other Politburo members weakened with age, the country lapsed into what Gorbachev has labeled the period of stagnation. The first Politburo consisted of seven Bolsheviks, among them Lenin, the founder of the Red Army Leon Trotsky, and the lesser-known Stalin. Following Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin eliminated Trotsky and other rivals from the ruling body. By the height of his power in 1952, he had expanded the membership to 25 voting members, all loyal aides. It also included 11 non-voting members. Nikita S. Khrushchev, who rose to power after Stalin's death in 1953, whittled the body to 15 voting and nine non-voting members. Although he instituted reforms, he tried to keep a tight personal grip on power, angering Politburo colleagues who tried unsuccessfully to oust him in 1957 and succeeded in 1964. Brezhnev, Khrushchev's successor, used the Politburo to forge a coalition among Soviet interest groups, such as the armed forces, the KGB, other government ministries and major industrial sectors, who held most of the dozen slots. He also included seven heads of <b> republic </b> parties as non-voting Politburo members, allowing them to run their regions in return for loyalty. Gorbachev and his allies argue that Brezhnev's system led to widescale corruption and blocked the transformation of the country into a modern industrial society. </p> 0.35324437702244  \n",
              "   Lithuania on Saturday proposed that its parliament compromise with the Kremlin and impose a moratorium on its declaration of independence, officials said. The proposal from the republic's Council of Ministers appeared to coincide with a compromise offered Tuesday by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the official news agency Tass said it ``could mark the beginning of the solution of all the so-called `Lithuanian problems.''' Also Saturday, Soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a fertilizer plant in Lithuania, partly easing the 2-month-old blockade of fuel they imposed to pressure the Baltic <b> republic </b> into renouncing its March 11 declaration of independence. The Lithuanian government suggested the declaration remain valid but its implementation be frozen while negotiations were under way with Moscow, said Algis Cekuolis, a consultant for the Baltic republic. However, Cekuolis said it was unclear whether the compromise would have enough support to be passed by the republic's legislature, which will probably consider it Monday. ``It will be received in parliament by very strong opposition,'' he predicted. The Lithuanian government, under Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, is considered far more disposed to compromise with the Kremlin than the parliament, which is led by President Vytautas Landsbergis and dominated by members of the pro-independence Sajudis popular front. Gorbachev proposed compromises Tuesday in a meeting with the leaders of the three secessionist Baltic states. He told the national Supreme Soviet legislature earlier that day that ``if Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of independence, we may start to talk. That means suspend its implementation at least for the duration of the talks.'' Saturday's proposal by the Lithuanian Council of Ministers suggested exactly that, government spokesmen said. ``Our act of independence would remain valid,'' said council spokesman Gentaras Jatkonis. ``But we are postponing the realization of it.'' Similar proposals have gone back and forth between the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius and Moscow in telegrams and informal talks ``like a ping-pong game'' for weeks but ``this is the first time it's on an official level,'' Cekuolis said. A spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament, Aidas Palubinskas, said he was told on Saturday by a pipeline dispatcher that natural gas was again flowing from the Soviet Union to the Azotas fertilizer plant in the city of Jonova. ``The plant will be getting 3.5 million cubic meters daily,'' Palubinskas was told by dispatcher Alexander Mishikov. Restoration of the gas supply fulfilled a promise made to Mrs. Prunskiene on Wednesday by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov that 15 percent of the republic's daily natural gas supply would be restored. Politburo member Yuri D. Maslyukov told a news <b> conference </b> in Moscow on Friday that the restoration of fuel to the Lithuanian plant was a goodwill gesture from the Kremlin and a ``reiteration of the Soviet government's interest in speeding negotiations.'' More than 26,000 people have lost their jobs because of the Kremlin's blockade of all oil, most natural gas and some raw materials. Palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the Azotas plant would mean 1,600 employees could return to work by the end of this week. At the beachfront resort of Jurmala in Latvia, leaders of the popular fronts of Latvia and Estonia and the Sajudis movement of Lithuania opened a <b> conference </b> to discuss the future of their movements under democratically elected governments. The delegates, 50 from each of the pro-independence movements, condemned the <b> economic </b> sanctions against Lithuania and discussed ways of increasing cooperation among the Baltic states and with other Soviet republics, Tass reported. ``Nobody has a right to demand either abrogation or halting the acts of independence,'' Tass quoted delegates as saying. ``A retreat will harm the democratic movement.'' </p> 0.351544221361977  \n",
              "   Thousands of people went on strike in the capital of Armenia, apparently unhappy over the Armenian leadership's presentation of an ethnic dispute at the national Communist Party conference, a newspaper said Tuesday. The Soviet government daily Izvestia said the strike began Monday, one day after ``many thousands'' of people met in the Theater Square of Yerevan, the capital of the southern republic. Most flights in and out of Yerevan were canceled, it said. In a Tuesday edition, Izvestia said: ``Like yesterday a series of the city's industrial concerns aren't working, or are working with less than a full work force.'' It said food stores and industries, as well as restaurants and medical services had been working Monday. The newspaper said farm work was going on in Stepanakert, the largest city of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, but that many other industries and institutions there also were shut down. Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of a territorial dispute between Armenia and the neighboring <b> republic </b> of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but the mountain enclave's predominantly Armenian population has been agitating since February to be annexed to Armenia. Armenia supports the demand. Azerbaijan is against it. At least 32 people were killed in riots over annexation which broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, at the end of February. Izvestia said the thousands of people who gathered on the Yerevan city square Sunday listened to a television broadcast by delegates to the four-day party <b> conference </b> in Moscow, which closed last Friday. Armenian party <b> leader </b> Suren Arutyunyan said in remarks broadcast on Soviet TV during the <b> conference </b> that authorities could not normalize the situation in Armenia, where large demonstrations frequently have occurred in support of Nagorno-Karabakh's demand. He proposed that the <b> conference </b> take up unspecified amendments to the Soviet constitution. The disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan has sent the issue to national authorities, and the constitution specifies no way to solve the dispute. Delegates who spoke on television supported Arutyunyan's call for restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd. But Izvestia said that after a ``stormy debate'' on the square, a committee was formed that called for a general strike after laying down a series of demands, including a quick, favorable resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The committee demanded that the Soviet Supreme Court take over the trials of those charged in the Sumgait violence and demanded full information about the alleged poisoning of workers at a factory in the town of Masis. Izvestia provided no more information about the Masis incident, except to say an investigation was under way. The party <b> conference </b> called for greater attention to republics' calls for <b> economic </b> autonomy, but said authorities would not tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic tensions. Besides Azerbaijan and Armenia, delegates from the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also brought up ethnic questions at the conference. About a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three Estonian political prisoners had gathered more than 6,000 signatures by Tuesday during a five-day demonstration in Tallinn, Estonia. ``We will continue the demonstration until they are freed or until the authorities give us an exact date for their release,'' Eve Parnaste said as she carried a poster at the protest outside the Estonian Supreme Court building. She said the three prisoners had been demanding publication of a secret 1939 pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that placed the Baltic <b> republics </b> of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia under Moscow's control. All three were arrested this year, charged with spreading anti-Soviet propaganda or slandering the Soviet state. Miss Parnaste's poster said, ``KGB is an evil empire,'' using the initials for the Soviet secret police. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Here is a text of President Bush's news conference Thursday: President Bush: Well I have a brief statement and then I'll be glad to take some questions. The United States is engaged in a collective effort involving the overwhelming majority of the member states of the United Nations to reverse the consequences of Iraqi aggression. And our goals, enshrined in five Security Council resolutions, are clear: the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government, the stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, and the protection of American citizens. What is at stake here is truly significant _ the dependability of America's commitments to its friends and allies, the shape of the post-postwar world, opposition to aggression, the potential domination of the energy resources that are crucial to the entire world. This effort has been truly international from the very outset. Many other countries are contributing. At last count, 22 countries have either responded to a request from Saudi Arabia to help deter further aggression, or are contributing maritime forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 665. And still others are providing other forms of financial and material <b> support </b> to these defense efforts or to countries whose economies are affected adversely by sanctions or by higher oil prices. And still others are paying a heavy economic price at home for complying with the United Nations sanctions. It is <b> important </b> that the considerable burden of the effort be shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free flow of oil. Indeed, anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in ensuring that all of us succeed. The United States has large interests in the balance and has undertaken commitments commensurate with them, and we're more than willing to bear our fair share of the burden. This includes above all the thousands of men and women in our armed forces who are now in the Gulf, but we also expect others to bear their fair share. A number of countries already have announced their willingness to help those adversely affected economically by this endeavor. And it's essential, though, that this be a concerted and coordinated one and that all affected countries participate. It is <b> important </b> to get the priorities right and make sure that those most deserving of assistance receive it and that those most able to contribute do so. And for that reason, I directed an interagency effort to develop a strategy to accomplish this objective. The group's report was presented at yesterday's National Security Council meeting here, and this morning I approved an <b> action </b> plan. And our approach calls for substantial economic assistance to those states _ in particular, I'd single out Turkey and Egypt, who are bearing a great <b> part </b> of the burden of sanctions and higher oil prices. The <b> plan </b> also targets additional countries, including Jordan, the countries of Eastern Europe and others for <b> special </b> assistance. The United States will also seek burdensharing for <b> part </b> of our own effort. At the same time, we will be asking other governments, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Federal Republic of Germany, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, free Kuwait, and others to join us in making available financial and, where appropriate, energy resources to countries that have been most affected by the current situation. To facilitate this undertaking, I've asked Secretary of State Jim Baker and the Secretary of the Treasury Nick Brady to lead high-level delegations to the Persian Gulf, Europe and Asia. And I'll be getting directly in touch with the leaders of these countries before Secretaries Baker and Brady arrive to set forth, spell out our general objectives. Let me close by repeating what I said the other day in meeting with the congressional leaders. The basic pieces of our <b> policy </b> are in place. The Iraqi regime stands in opposition to the entire world and to the interests of the Iraqi people. It is truly Iraq against the world. But I want to make this point clear, we have no argument with the people of Iraq. The sanctions are beginning to take hold. And in the meantime, we want to ensure that countries contributing to this unprecedented collective response do not suffer for doing so. And what I've announced today and what I expect will be implemented in the coming days should help create a context in which sanctions against Iraq can be sustained with the intended effect. Another area where there has been unprecedented international solidarity is OPEC's willingness to take up the slack in oil production created by the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwait's oil. In this connection, I met this morning with our energy advisers who are watching the oil production <b> situation </b> very, very closely. And we are pleased with OPEC's decision to help take up the slack in crude oil production. And although we are in what I would see as a transition period, the <b> situation </b> appears manageable. At the present time, we don't anticipate <b> major </b> imbalances in the oil market. But we do have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve tested and available if it is truly needed. And our energy <b> policy </b> is resulting in increased oil production and fuel switching to natural gas and to other fuels. I also repeat my previous request for Americans to conserve and for all parties to act responsibly. Right now, the situation, I would say, is relative stable, and I am very pleased by the coordination that has taken place with so many countries in maintaining adequate fuel levels.

              "   Here is the official text of the European Community statement on South Africa issued Saturday. The European Community and its member states have consistently followed developments in South Africa with the greatest attention and have given a favorable reception to the initiatives which have been to bring about the abolition of apartheid and the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. They have already expressed approval of the results of the talks between the government and the ANC (African National Congress), in particular those of the Pretoria meeting in August which opened the way to the negotiation of a new constitution. They deplore the phase of serious violence through which South Africa is passing, which may endanger these developments. They welcome, however, further indications serving to confirm that the process of <b> change </b> already begun is going ahead in the direction advocated by the Strasbourg European Council. They have decided to continue to encourage this process. Against this background, the European Council has decided that as soon as legislative <b> action </b> is taken by the African government to repeal the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, the Community and its member states will proceed to an easing of the set of measures adopted in 1986. As of now, so as to contribute to combating unemployment and improving the economic and social <b> situation </b> in South Africa, and to encourage the movement under way aimed at the complete abolition of apartheid, the European Council has decided to lift the ban on new investments. At the same time, the Community and its member states, with the objective of sending a clear message of political <b> support </b> to the victims of apartheid, and intending to contribute to a new economic and social balance in South Africa, have agreed to strengthen the program of positive measures and to adapt it to the requirements of the new situation, including requirements related to the return and resettlement of the exiles. The Community and its member states hope in this way to be able to contribute to the speeding up of the process under way through sending to all the parties involved in negotiations a concrete sign of <b> support </b> for the establishment of a new South Africa, united, non-racial and democratic and capable of resuming the place which it deserves in the international community. </p> 0.272641028930976  \n",
              "   The Federal Communications Commission has decided to relax its rule on ownership of more than one radio station. The new rule would allow commonly owned stations to be as close as 25 miles apart, as long as they are in different markets. The rule would reduce by about half the distance required between two stations owned by the same person or company, and it would allow common ownership of stations in adjacent markets. The FCC said the new rule will enable more station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that result from common ownership of stations. The FCC also agreed to recommend that Congress require cable companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights to carry their signals. The commission is expected to extend that recommendation to cover local TV signals before it issues a final order in the matter. </p> 0.272405528356638  \n",

              "   Thousands of relics left by a lost Indian tribe in the ruins of their famed cliff houses were methodically looted before the turn of the century. Now a band of ``reverse archaeologists'' wants to bring them home. Before Congress outlawed the practice in 1905, collecting baskets, pots, tools and other everyday household items from Anasazi Indian ruins was a thrilling romp through history for explorers hired by East Coast collectors. Like the swashbuckling treasure hunter in the ``Indiana Jones'' movies, they took the ancient ruins of a culture that vanished before Europeans reached the New World. Most of the loot eventually found its way into <b> museum </b> display cases. Large collections are housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Museum of the American Indian in New York, among others. But a group of volunteer researchers is eager to bring them home to the Four Corners area of the Southwest where the Anasazi pioneered farming and <b> built </b> dense communities hundreds of feet high in scenic cliffsides. Julia Johnson, the director of the volunteer Wetherill-Grand Gulch researchers, decried the looting at a recent symposium on the early Anasazis, known as the Basketmakers, in Blanding, Utah. The group wants to reverse the actions of 1890s explorers and return the <b> artifacts </b> to museums as close to the ruins from which they were taken as possible. To help achieve that and to help scientists study the Anasazi, 5,000 pages of documents and 500 photographs have been compiled on the <b> museum </b> <b> artifacts </b> to trace their origins. Since many of the early-day explorers kept meticulous diaries, ``it's possible in some cases to identify exactly which hole something came out of,'' said Fred Blackburn, a biologist who joined the ``reverse archaeologists.'' Blackburn, 40, and his colleagues crawl through Grand Gulch in Utah, about 100 miles west of Cortez, searching for signatures the explorers carved into cliff walls. By matching the individual <b> artifacts </b> on display in Eastern museums with the diaries, Blackburn's group can supply a research base for scientists studying the Basketmaker era of the Anasazi, he said. The ruins were virtually cleared out and their treasures carted off by the time Congress forbade the practice in 1905, Blackburn said. ``And the expeditions weren't real researchers,'' said Blackburn, whose wife, Victoria Atkins, is an archaeologist. ``There's so much we don't know about the Basketmakers.'' The Basketmaker Anasazis lived in the area from about the time of Christ until the year 700, Blackburn said. They are believed to be the farming pioneers of the tribe that <b> built </b> a thriving civiliation in the famous cliff houses of Mesa Verde National Park. Their Pueblo Anasazi descendants disappeared from the area, apparently driven by a long drought, in about 1300. ``We're putting this together so researchers can go back and find out what the origins of these people were, their customs, where they came from and where they went,'' Blackburn said. He started with the diary of Charles Cary Graham, who with Charles McLoyd began excavating Grand Gulch in 1890. The pair met Richard Wetherill and Charlie Mason just as the latter two were riding out after discovering the landmark Balcony House at Mesa Verde. Wetherill, a nearby rancher and amateur archaeologist, hired Graham and McLoyd to bring <b> artifacts </b> from Grand Gulch to the local historical society. The collection later ended up at the Field Museum in Chicago. As news of the rich ruins spread, other expeditions followed, explorers erasing clues to the mysterious Anasazi's past in their diligence to gather prized artifacts. One likely <b> site </b> for any relics returned to the region would be the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores, a town north of Cortez. Initial efforts will try to arrange artifact loans, with the eventual goal of establishing permanent exhibits, volunteers said. Fund-raising is under way to pay for lobbying visits to museums that house large Anasazi collections. Blackburn, who specializes in studies of Bighorn sheep, says his strong ties to the Four Corners area prompted his ``reverse archaeology'' work. He's especially fascinated with evidence of the Anasazis ability to co-exist with the sheep that used to roam the area in large numbers. The fledgling ``reverse archaeolgist'' movement _ looking for <b> artifacts </b> in museums to bring them back to historic sites, rather than the other way around _could provide clues to true archaeologists enabling them to unravel the mystery surrounding the demise of the Anasazi, he said. ``Archaeology is really pretty new here in southwest Colorado,'' he said. ``And there hasn't been much done on the Basketmakers. ``There are a lot of parallels between the Anasazi and what we have today. Overpopulation and drought were a major problem for them and many archaeologists think that's what drove them out of here. Overpopulation and drought are big problems for us, too.'' </p> 0.469916214218051  \n",
              "   A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and nondescript. Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office <b> building </b> planned for downtown Atlanta. Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the 50-story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is a slender, post-modern <b> tower </b> of stone with tall arched entryways and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high, eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern. Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words like ``gracious,'' ``truly wonderful,'' ``serene,'' ``imposing'' and ``glamorous'' to describe the tower. ``It certainly <b> projects </b> a vibrance to the rest of the world,'' said Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development with the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ``It's just beautiful. Everybody's just staggered by it.'' The <b> tower </b> is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of the city's tallest buildings. Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going up in Atlanta, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper complex was altered to complement the rose-colored IBM tower. New York architect John Burgee, whose firm designed the IBM <b> building </b> with design consultant Philip Johnson, won't take credit for transforming Atlanta's skyline. But he said the city's image, as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change. ``Atlanta has been looking for its identity,'' Burgee said in a telephone interview from his New York office. ``It's an historical city (but) its architecture and image is not strictly historical. You think of Atlanta and you think of `Gone With The Wind.' Now, there is an attempt to come up with a visual image. ``We all know Peachtree Street, but you don't think of its buildings,'' he said. ``Like in New York, the Empire State Building; Chicago, the Sears building; San Francisco, the TransAmerica building. Atlanta doesn't have that. It's moving toward that, very definitely.'' Burgee and Johnson also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown Atlanta. Another planned <b> project </b> grouped in the ``Son of IBM'' <b> building </b> spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section, a complex of three office <b> buildings </b> and a <b> hotel </b> being developed by AT&T and the Atlanta-based Landmarks Group. When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the excitement over the nearby IBM Tower, its architects, Thompson, Ventulett & Stainback, redrew the plans to use rose glass above rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire. The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by Portman, whose imprint is already deeply felt in Atlanta, primarily through the Peachtree Center and the towering cylindrical Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. Portman's new <b> building </b> is slated to begin <b> construction </b> next year and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One Atlantic as the Southeast's tallest building. Unveiling the design in May, Portman said it was ``respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern architecture.'' Dale Durfee, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech, said completion of the IBM <b> tower </b> signaled the acceleration of a change in the look of the city that began a decade ago. ``Atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla,'' he said, ``with no development of architectural significance.'' Burgee echoed that appraisal, saying, ``It was pretty nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you (to Atlanta) blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you wouldn't have a clue where you are.'' Durfee said that 10 years ago, Atlanta was groping to form an identity and had no demand for the type of <b> buildings </b> now are going up. Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office buildings, Durfee said, and corporate sponsorship of <b> building </b> <b> projects </b> has changed the rules of skyscraper financing. Some say that all the <b> building </b> activity simply makes good business sense. ``Sure, there's competitive prestige. Good architecture is good business,'' said Truman Hartshorn, chairman of the geography department at Georgia State University and a specialist in urban affairs. A good-looking building, he said, ``is easier to sell to the financing people as well as the tenants.''

              "   The <b> cost </b> of living in Fairfield County is among the highest in the country, but the <b> cost </b> of dying has become pricey, too. To make matters worse, burial plots are running out. Most cemeteries, where single plots can <b> cost </b> $1,000 and more, are likely to be filled within 10 or 15 years, according to funeral home and cemetery managers. ``Cemeteries are going to become a thing of the past,'' said William E. Magner Jr., who manages Willowbrook Cemetery in Westport. Harriet Steuber, president of a group that administers Union Cemetery of Norwalk, said that once <b> space </b> runs out, ``I guess we'll all have to be cremated and dumped in the sound,'' referring to Long Island Sound, the stretch of ocean off the Connecticut coast. ``I don't like to think about it. It gives me the creeps,'' Steuber said. One solution may lie above ground. Mausoleums up to four stories high are becoming increasingly common in the region. Construction of one such facility by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport began this month at Darien's St. John's Cemetery. ``It's one of the, shall we say, contemporary modes of burial to help meet the lack of space,'' said Monsignor Nicholas B. Grieco. The structures are often multistory units containing hallways lined with crypts. Each floor might contain up to 100 bodies. ``Think of it as a giant bookcase with slots,'' Magner said. But mausoleums are not cost-savers. They are generally more expensive than below-ground burial, Grieco said. Other cemetery managers say mausoleum interment is about twice the price of traditional burial. Sometimes it's possible to economize. At St. John's Cemetery in Norwalk, a two-grave plot can be used for four individuals _ one on top of another. The practice is allowed at the discretion of the cemetery, which charges $1,050 for the double plots. But the <b> cost </b> of the grave <b> site </b> is only the start. Add to that payments to the cemetery for digging the grave and the price of a concrete vault, plus a foundation for a gravestone and it could <b> cost </b> as much as $2,000. Cremation, which one local funeral director said now accounts for about 30 percent of his business, can save several hundred dollars at the funeral home and there would be no cemetery costs. Basic cremation and transporation services can <b> cost </b> as little as $160. </p> 0.431739320901043  \n",
              "   One of the last persons to receive a Jarvik artifical <b> heart </b> before federal <b> approval </b> of the <b> device </b> was withdrawn died after surgery to replace the pump with a donor organ. He spent 87 days on the device. Carl E. Bryant, 43, of Louisville, died Wednesday, eight hours after the transplant operation, said doctors at Louisville's Jewish Hospital. ``We did everything we could for Carl Bryant,'' said Dr. Laman A. Gray Jr., who transplanted the heart. Physicians said the donor heart, which became available late Tuesday, met the criteria for transplantation. But the left ventricle, or main pumping chamber, failed to function once the <b> heart </b> was inside Bryant. The Jarvik 7-70 assist <b> device </b> was implanted Dec. 22 at Humana Hospital-Audubon by Dr. William DeVries, who pioneered use of the artificial heart. ``The transplant surgery offered Carl's only real chance for survival,'' DeVries said in a statement Wednesday. Bryant was the second-to-last person to receive a Jarvik pump in this country before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew its <b> approval </b> of the <b> device </b> Jan. 8, said Gary Cole, an executive vice president with Symbion Inc., the Arizona manufacturer of the pumps. The agency said its inspections uncovered ``serious deficiencies'' in the way Symbion was carrying out studies with the device. In February, the FDA said it would allow use of the <b> device </b> as a last resort, but only when all other available treatments had failed and when no other life-saving <b> device </b> could be used. The <b> device </b> was last implanted in the United States in Columbus, Ohio, on Dec. 31, Cole said Thursday. He said two Jarvik pumps have been implanted in other countries since the FDA withdrawal. Cole said 159 Jarviks have been implanted as bridges to transplants since 1985. He said the longest-surviving patient to use the Jarvik while awaiting a donor organ was a French woman. She lived 603 days on the device. Dr. Barney Clark, the first person implanted with a Jarvik heart, died in 1983 after 112 days on the device. He received a Jarvik-7, which was supposed to be a premanent replacement for his heart. Bryant had a massive <b> heart </b> attack in July and underwent cardiac catheterization and angioplastic surgery in his left coronary artery. His wife, Cynthia, took him to the hospital Dec. 16 after he complained of chest pains. Three hours before he was to undergo triple bypass surgery, Bryant suffered a second massive <b> heart </b> attack. DeVries implanted the Jarvik <b> device </b> during a six-hour procedure. ``I have no qualms about Carl being on the assist <b> device </b> at all,'' Cynthia Bryant said. ``It worked wonderfully and may further research to help someone else. And we had three good months together that we would not have had otherwise.'' </p> 0.428420640878955  \n",
              "   Proponents of artificial hearts fear the Food and Drug Administration's withdrawal of <b> approval </b> for the Jarvik <b> heart </b> could hurt research toward a totally implantable device, but most see it as a temporary setback. And they don't believe the action will have a serious impact on <b> heart </b> patients because other temporary heart-assist devices still are available as a bridge to a <b> heart </b> transplant. ``It is a shame because the Jarvik, for its limitation, did make some positive contributions,'' said Dr. Antonio Gotto, chief of internal medical services at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and past president of the American Heart Association. ``I hope this will be only a temporary, not a permanent, setback toward the goal of achieving a totally implantable heart.'' The FDA informed Symbion Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., this week that it was withdrawing <b> approval </b> for continued investigational uses of its artificial heart, both as a permanent replacement and a temporary bridge for patients awaiting a human <b> heart </b> transplant. The Jarvik heart, named after its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik, gained household recognition after it was implanted in Barney Clark on Dec. 2, 1982. He lived 112 days, his new <b> heart </b> tethered to a bulky external power system, before he succumbed to multiple organ failure. In revoking Symbion's approval, the FDA said it had found ``serious deficiencies'' in manufacturing quality control, monitoring of research sites, servicing of equipment, training of personnel and reporting of adverse reactions to FDA. Dr. Donald Olsen, director of the University of Utah's Institute for Biomedical Engineering, said he was ``surprised and disappointed'' by the FDA's action and hoped it would not hurt future federal funding of artificial <b> heart </b> research in general, particularly for totally implantable devices. ``Our concern, of course, is that this particular publicity will not have a negative influence'' on artificial <b> heart </b> development in general, said Olsen. ``But I would like to make sure (people know) that the artificial <b> heart </b> did not fail; it was a failure on the part of Symbion to meet the requirements of the FDA'' for improving the device. Gerson Rosenberg, a biomedical engineer who leads Pennsylvania State University's efforts to design an electric heart, said he did not think the decision to pull the Jarvik would hinder research. But others felt the decision could slow research in the field. ``By removing the Jarvik, you take the first and main artificial <b> heart </b> player out of the ballgame,'' said Dr. Jacob Kolff, who heads Temple University's efforts to develop the temporary ``Philadelphia Heart.'' ``That leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think there may be a future for an artificial heart,'' said the surgeon, whose father, Dr. Willem Kolff, developed the first artificial kidney in 1943. Withdrawal of the permanent Jarvik <b> heart </b> leaves only one other natural-heart replacement with FDA investigational approval, but that <b> device </b> is used only as a temporary bridge and only at Hershey Medical Center of Penn State. Other companies have approvals for temporary implants and for left ventricular assist pumps that help the natural <b> heart </b> work without replacement. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Thousands of Iranians gathered at the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's tomb Thursday, the 11th anniversary of his return from exile, and his son preached continued hostility to America, Tehran <b> radio </b> said. On the first anniversary since the revolutionary patriarch's death June 3, Ahmad Khomeini said his father, known as the Imam, constantly defied ``global arrogance,'' an Iranian phrase for United States and its allies. ``We must always remain on the Imam's path,'' he said at a ceremony beginning a 10-day celebration of the Islamic revolution. Ahmad Khomeini said his father warned that, ``if we show the slightest bit of complacency, America will deliver its final blow against us. You, the people, must prepare for struggle against America.'' The <b> radio </b> the younger Khomeini, a leading radical, praised his father's successor as spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for ``treading the same path as the Imam.'' His exhortation for no compromise with the United States was seen as a warning to President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatist faction in Iran. Rafsanjani, who attended the ceremony Khomeini's golden-domed tomb in the Behesht Zahra cemetery, seeks better relations with the West in order to obtain help in recovering from eight years of war with Iraq. The first part of Rafsanjani's 5-year development plan, calling for up to $20 billion in foreign investment, got Parliament's approval Wednesday over opposition from radicals who want state control and no foreign involvement. Tehran television showed throngs at the cemetery chanting ``Death to America!'' and ``Death to Israel!'' Iranian officials paid their respects at the tomb and promised to safeguard Khomeini's ideological legacy, the <b> radio </b> said. ``At a time when the government was in the hands of the enemy, the Imam's coming from a safe place to the center of the danger was an act rooted in the immense power of the Lord,'' Rafsanjani said at the graveside, the <b> radio </b> reported. Khomeini returned from 14 years of exile Feb. 1, 1979, after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced to flee. Ten days later, the government he left behind collapsed and Khomeini proclaimed the Islamic republic, Rafsanjani said: ``The Iranian people have proved that if a nation is resolute in its stand, and if it has courage and spirit, it cannot be defeated.'' He said recent changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere were ``a small example of what the people of Iran achieved 11 years ago, and these popular rebellions are the legacy of the people of Iran.'' Khamenei, the nation's spiritual leader, told another gathering in Tehran: ``The future belongs to Islam, the Moslems and the freedom-loving nations of the world,'' the television reported. ``In the confrontation with the organizations of the satanic powers (the West), it will be Islam which triumphs.'' Despite the fiery rhetoric, this year's anniversary of the revolution differs from past observances. It reflects the more more relaxed character of Rafsanjani's government, formed in August, and an easing of Islamic rigidity. While Khomeini was alive, the anniversary was a time of rallies to show support for him, and of reruns on state television of bloody clashes between revolutionary zealots and the shah's forces. On Thursday, television showed film of Khomeini arriving in Tehran in 1979 on a chartered Air France jet, but comedy and children's shows dominated the morning programming. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said music would be part of the celebrations this year for the first time. Khomeini felt good Moslems should shun music. </p> 0.329791664560139  \n",
              "   An Iranian official said both presidential candidates have asked Iran for help securing the <b> release </b> of <b> hostages </b> <b> held </b> in Lebanon. Hussein Sheikholeslam, a deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, spoke at a news conference late Thursday in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, where he stopped en route to Kenya. He said Republican candidate George Bush and Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis made contact with Iran through third parties, including governments and individuals. Bush has denied this, and officials in Washington insist the United States has no direct or indirect contacts with the Iranians. Sheikholeslam said the identity of the intermediaries is ``a touchy question'' and that he did not want to get involved ``in the election games of the United States.'' But he said the contacts were not at the level of those conducted in 1986 that led to the Irangate scandal, in which arms were secretly sold to Iran. He did not elaborate. Sheikholeslam stressed that normalizing relations with the United States should be separated from the issue of the <b> hostages </b> <b> held </b> in Lebanon. Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem militants are believed to hold most of the 14 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Nine of the captives are American. The longest <b> held </b> is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was <b> kidnapped </b> March 16, 1985. Sheikholeslam said Iran also was concerned about four Iranians who have been missing in Lebanon for six years. He said that while Iran was appealing for the <b> release </b> of its nationals, it was not necessarily linking their fate to that of the 14 Westerners. Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who lives in exile in Paris, said recently that Richard Lawless, a former U.S. official, negotiated with Iranian government representatives on behalf of Bush for the <b> release </b> of the American hostages. In Washington on Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied again that the U.S. government was negotiating with Iran. Fitzwater took issue with a report Friday in The Nation, a Jerusalem weekly, that <b> talks </b> on the <b> hostages </b> were <b> held </b> but recessed because of news leaks. ``No one is authorized to talk for the (U.S.) government,'' he said. ``As we have said before, there are all kinds of people around the world freelancing on this situation.'' Fitzwater also predicted more such stories, although he did not say why. ``Suffice it to say, we find them (the news reports) mostly detrimental,'' he said. ``What they do is build up people's expectations when they are not warranted.'' </p> 0.322289821428602  \n",
              "   The United States and Iran have signed a $105 million settlement of some 3,000 financial claims, bringing the two countries one step closer to re-establishing economic relations, a U.S. official said today. The settlement deals primarily with so-called ``Small Claims'' for under $250,000 that stem from the 1979 Islamic revolution, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. It clears the way for the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal to deal with about $16 billion in major claims, whose resolution in turn could open the way to normalizing economic ties between the two nations, the official said. The settlement accord was signed late Sunday night or early this morning by Timothy Ramish, U.S. agent to the tribunal, and Iranian Agent Ali Nobari, according to the American official at the tribunal. The most recent settlement <b> talks </b> between U.S. and Iranian officials occurred shortly after the <b> release </b> of American <b> hostages </b> Frank Reed and Robert Polhill by pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon. But U.S. and Iranian representatives to the tribunal have repeatedly stated the <b> talks </b> dealt only with financial arbitration and not with the six remaining Americans still in captivity in Lebanon. Last week a U.S. State Department official in Washington, who commented on condition of anonymity, said he could not predict whether resolving its financial disputes will result in the <b> release </b> of remaining <b> hostages </b> or was in any way related to the <b> release </b> of Polhill and Reed. The Small Claims package dealt primarily with Americans who left behind personal possessions or were owed salaries by Iranian companies when they fled Iran during the revolution. They were settled for a total of $50 million. The settlement also provided $55 million for repayment of a loan from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The tribunal was set up as part of the Algiers Accord of 1980, which resulted in freedom for the American <b> hostages </b> <b> held </b> by Iranian militants at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The tribunal has three Iranian, three American and three third-nation arbitrators. The biggest claim still before the tribunal, valued at up to $11 billion by Iran, is for military equipment which Iran ordered but did not receive as a result of the embargo imposed by the U.S. government. After the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979, Iran canceled contracts for $9 billion worth of weaponry, including four destroyers under construction that were later taken over by the U.S. Navy. Remaining major claims, totaling about $5 billion, were filed by American oil companies for property and operations expropiated by the Iranian government, as well as for broken contracts. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini wrote an aide in 1986 asking what ``we can do to bring heat'' on a <b> federal </b> banking regulator who was opposed by <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> owner Charles H. Keating Jr., the Senate Ethics Committee was told today. The senator's memo to his <b> staff </b> aide, Laurie A. Sedlmayr, was written in December 1986, after Keating had made clear his opposition to top bank regulator Edwin Gray, who wanted Keating's <b> thrift </b> to adhere to investment limits. Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett cited the memo in questioning Sedlmayr as the panel held its fifth day of hearings into allegations DeConcini and four other <b> senators </b> improperly intervened with <b> regulators </b> on behalf of Keating, a financial contributor. Sedlmayr said she was aware Keating wanted Gray out of office. DeConcini wrote her a memo on Dec. 11, 1986, citing press accounts of potential financial and ethical problems facing Gray and asking, ``Anything we can do to bring heat?'' She said she responded five days later saying it was ``probably unnecessary'' for him to take action and suggesting the senator ``stay out of this.'' Sedlmayr, under questioning by Bennett, said Keating was more aggressive than many other businessmen she dealt with. ``I found him to be something of a zealot and I wasn't comfortable with that,'' she said. ``I think the senator probably thought I was overstating the case,'' she said. Keating, who owned the now defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan, and his associates contributed $1.3 million to the senators' campaigns or favored causes. As the panel began its fifth day of hearings in three weeks, DeConcini, D-Ariz., was the only one of the five <b> senators </b> under <b> investigation </b> who attended the session. The other four are Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Donald Riegle of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio. Sedlmayr was questioned about a memo she wrote to DeConcini in 1987 suggesting a possible deal with the government on behalf of Keating's <b> savings </b> and loan. DeConcini denies he offered a deal or tried to negotiate for Keating in the April 2, 1987, meeting. Sedlmayr testified that DeConcini went to the April 2 <b> meeting </b> with three other <b> senators </b> and Gray despite being warned by an aide that the session was a ``political mistake.'' She testified that she was not concerned about the propriety of the meeting, but was concerned Gray ``would misrepresent it'' later. ``I told him I didn't think it was a good idea and could later be misinterpreted by the press,'' she said. ``I thought ... it was a political mistake.'' Sedlmayr and other aides were not included in the meeting, but she said that when it ended, DeConcini ``said he was pretty disgusted.'' She said DeConcini recounted that Gray had said, ``I don't know anything about Lincoln, I don't have any information and you'll have to meet with the <b> regulators </b> in San Francisco.'' Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, did not attend that meeting. However, he did attend a session on Lincoln a week later with the other <b> senators </b> and San Francisco-based <b> federal </b> regulators. The question of whether DeConcini offered a deal on Keating's behalf is considered crucial to the <b> ethics </b> investigation. Bennett, told the panel ``there is overwhelming evidence'' DeConcini asked Gray to withdraw a regulation opposed by Keating in exchange for a promise by Lincoln to make more home loans. The regulation limited Lincoln's ability to make risky investments in speculative real estate ventures. Sedlmayr's memo to her boss detailed ``What American Continental wants from Gray for concessions,'' and ``What American Continental is willing to do.'' American Continental was Lincoln's Phoenix-based parent company, controlled by Keating. A sworn statement by another Senate aide says that DeConcini took the Sedlmayr memo with him to the April 2 <b> meeting </b> and ``made verbal references to the subjects discussed in the memorandum.'' That statement was by Mary Jane Veno, administrative assistant to Glenn. She said she was told of the memo's use by Gene Karp, DeConcini's administrative assistant. When the <b> meeting </b> was over, she said, McCain asked DeConcini to explain what he had been talking about and in response DeConcini gave McCain a copy of the memo. But Karp said Friday he did not know if DeConcini actually referred to the memo and could not recall what he told Veno. ``As I remember it now, Gray said at the very beginning he didn't know anything about Lincoln and DeConcini never got into the subject matter of the <b> investigation </b> or anything about that,'' Karp said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Whether there was any specific reference made, I can't answer. Only the principals that were there can answer it.'' Gray has said DeConcini offered a ``quid pro quo'' proposal and that Gray believed the <b> meeting </b> was improper. No aides attended the April 2 meeting, and Bennett said there is evidence DeConcini's <b> office </b> instructed all to come alone. Lincoln was the object of a bank board examination at the time of the meeting. Bennett said the <b> senators </b> were there ``with varying degrees of intensity, to pressure the board to end promptly the Lincoln examination.'' Lincoln was seized by the <b> federal </b> government in April 1989 at a potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion to cover insured deposits. </p> 0.526604334871864  \n",
              "   A U.S. <b> thrift </b> regulator testified Friday that Sen. Dennis DeConcini broke the bounds of propriety - but four other <b> senators </b> did not - when they intervened on behalf of <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> owner Charles H. Keating Jr. Regulator Michael Patriarca, addressing the Senate Ethics Committee, drew the line between the behavior of DeConcini, D-Ariz. and four colleagues: John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif. Patriarca said it was wrong for a senator to attempt to ``influence, to change the outcome'' of an examination that was highly critical of Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan. ``My personal view is Senator DeConcini did that,'' he said. ``It's not clear to me that any of the others did.'' The regulator was referring to the senators' conduct at an April 9, 1987 <b> meeting </b> with four San Francisco-based <b> regulators </b> - including Patriarca - who were responsible for the Lincoln investigation. Patriarca also said he would fault the <b> senators </b> generally, because they ``appeared to have made up their minds in advance'' that Keating was right and the <b> regulators </b> were wrong in finding serious problems at Lincoln. Patriarca's two days of testimony backed the assertion of his ex-boss, former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray, that DeConcini took the lead in trying to negotiate a deal on Keating's behalf. DeConcini denied that he sought a waiver for Lincoln of a rule prohibiting risky investments, in return for the <b> thrift </b> establishing a home mortgage <b> loan </b> program. Patriarca was questioned by Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., one of six Ethics Committee members who will judge whether the five <b> senators </b> improperly intervened for Keating. Keating and associates donated $1.3 million to the campaigns and political causes of the five senators. The committee has held nine days of hearings in an effort to determine whether the money influenced the intervention. The hearing adjourned until Monday after a former member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board testified he received calls from Cranston and DeConcini in April 1989 - immediately before the government takeover of Lincoln. In those calls, said Roger Martin, both <b> senators </b> urged the board to approve a sale of Lincoln rather than its seizure. The requests were rejected. All the <b> senators </b> except Riegle met on Keating's behalf with Gray on April 2, 1987 in DeConcini's office. When the chief regulator said he lacked details of the Lincoln investigation, the four San Francisco-based <b> regulators </b> including Patriarca, were summoned to the April 9 meeting. That also was in DeConcini's <b> office </b> and this time Riegle joined the group. Rudman asked Patriarca whether he thought DeConcini was ``out of line'' in the April 9 meeting, when he sought the waiver for Lincoln. ``Yes I did, senator,'' the regulator responded. He said that the proper way to challenge the regulation was through the courts and Lincoln ``had a retainer with every significant law firm in the country'' to do so. Lincoln in fact did, shortly before the meetings with regulators, file a court suit challenging the rule. The suit was not successful. Patriarca said McCain showed the ``least prejudice'' toward <b> regulators </b> at the April 9 meeting; DeConcini and ``perhaps Sen. Glenn seemed to have their minds made up pretty substantially'' and Riegle was ``in the middle.'' Another member of the committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., asked if the <b> senators </b> were hostile at the meeting. ``I think it was hostile,'' Patriarca said. ``We were being dressed down.'' Helms then asked whether the <b> senators </b> expressed ``surprise or shock'' after the <b> regulators </b> informed them that serious problems - and possible criminality - were found at Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif. ``We didn't seem to be getting through to the senators,'' the regulator said. ``They did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that we were trying to convey to them.'' On Thursday, Patriarca said the <b> senators </b> became less aggressive when <b> regulators </b> said they would make criminal referrals to the Justice Department. </p> 0.430818882237569  \n",
              "   The Senate Ethics Committee today opened politically-charged hearings into links between five <b> senators </b> and the owner of a failed <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> and the panel's chairman bluntly told the lawmakers that many people believe ``you sold your office.'' Four of the so-called Keating Five looked on as Sen. Howell Heflin said, ``many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services were bought by Charles Keating, that you were bribed, that you sold your office, that you traded your honor and your good names for contributions and other benefits.'' Sens. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona each listened intently as Heflin spoke in his gravely Southern accent. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment, did not attend. All five deny any wrongdoing. Committee counsel Robert Bennett jostled a boxed puzzle before the committee members as he began his opening statement, saying he would provide them with a picture that later pieces of evidence would fill in. Bennett said Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle ``were important players'' in helping Keating in his ``all-out war'' with <b> federal </b> regulators. He said McCain and Glenn played lesser roles. Bennett said he did not contend it was improper for the <b> senators </b> to hold meetings with <b> federal </b> regulators, but that it was up to the panel to decide whether their actions were improper. He said ``there can be no doubt'' that the intent of each of the five <b> senators </b> was to help Keating when they met with <b> federal </b> <b> regulators </b> in 1987. The five <b> senators </b> received a total of $1.3 million in campaign contributions or donations to their favored causes from Keating and his associates. All contacted <b> federal </b> <b> regulators </b> on behalf of Keating at a time when the government was considering whether to seize the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine, Calif.-based <b> thrift </b> institution. The <b> thrift </b> later collapsed at an estimated cost to the taxpayers of $2 billion. Heflin told the five they would have the chance to say whether the donations ``influenced your actions in any way.'' He said lawmakers' activities legitimately include helping their constituents and overseeing government institutions and added that there is room for disagreement about conclusions in the case. Bennett said the evidence will be clear despite the refusal of Keating to answer questions during the Senate inquiry. Keating has been indicted in California on state securities fraud charges and is awaiting trial. ``One could ask the question, `If Mr. Keating were here, would you believe what he had to say anyway?''' Bennett said. The five <b> senators </b> have become a symbol of the massive <b> savings </b> industry collapse, and the outcome of the <b> ethics </b> hearings could intensify the political ramifications of what so far has been a bipartisan scandal. In addition, the <b> case </b> has highlighted a political system that gives lawmakers great latitude in contacting <b> federal </b> <b> regulators </b> on behalf of constituents, at the same time they are dependent on campaign contributions to mount their political campaigns. The hearings stemmed from a complaint last year by the citizens group Common Cause. ``It's not just the five <b> senators </b> but the whole Senate whose integrity and credibility is on the line,'' said Fred Werthheimer, the organization's leader. Heflin and others on the panel said the <b> case </b> should not create a standard that bars members of Congress from intervening with <b> federal </b> agencies on behalf of constituents or campaign contributors. ``A standard of conduct which would preclude members of Congress from intervening on behalf of individuals who happened to have contributed to or raised funds for their campaign is nonsensical and unworkable under existing law,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., another member of the committee, complained that panel has taken too long with the case. ``We should have already taken certain ... actions,'' he said. Heflin, D-Ala., defended the panel's decision to hold the hearings against charges of partisanship. ``On all the votes taken by the committee ... not one was divided along partisan lines,'' he said. With documents stacked several inches high on a table covered with green felt, Heflin framed the issue that the <b> ethics </b> panel will have to grapple with: ``The allegation in this case, that an individual used his wealth to get preferential treatment from government officials in the performance of their official duties, raises questions which are as old as history, and issues that bear on the balance of power among the branches of the <b> federal </b> government. The committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or recommend a more serious punishment to the full Senate. Each senator has denied any connection between Keating's money and their meetings with regulators. The basic issue is whether any violated Senate rules against exerting improper influence in return for compensation. All except Riegle attended an April 2, 1987, <b> meeting </b> with Ed Gray, then the top <b> thrift </b> regulator. All five attended another <b> meeting </b> a week later with San Francisco-based bank examiners who revealed that potential criminal actions by Lincoln were involved. McCain's top aide, Chris Koch, said McCain would make the <b> case </b> that he ended his friendship with Keating on March 24, 1987, when Keating asked the senator to negotiate with <b> regulators </b> on his behalf. ``There's no smoking gun on Don Riegle,'' the Michigan senator's lawyer, Thomas Green, said before the hearing. He contended that Riegle's <b> meeting </b> with <b> regulators </b> was unrelated to a fund-raising effort Keating directed for Riegle. DeConcini wrote a letter to about 5,000 supporters this week denying wrongdoing. ``You may hear derogatory statements about me and my office, but I can assure you that I have not betrayed my public trust, nor do I intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their dealings with our government,'' DeConcini said. Glenn has said in the past that he had no discussions on behalf of Lincoln after the 1987 <b> meeting </b> when <b> regulators </b> said criminal charges were possible. Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said Cranston contends, ``I pocketed no money, I broke no law, I violated no Senate rule. Those are undisputed facts.'' </p> 0.352777354026735  \n",
              "   Gov. Mario Cuomo today accused lawyers for a black teen-ager who says she was assaulted by six white men of ``making up conditions'' as part of their continuing refusal to have the young woman testify about the case. Meanwhile, the teen-ager's aunt was quoted today as saying the girl hadn't even talked about the <b> case </b> with the lawyers representing her. Tawana Brawley, 16, missing for four days in November, was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces, with racial insults scrawled on her body. She said she was assaulted by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge. Miss Brawley, of Wappinger's Falls north of New York City, and her family have refused to be questioned further on the advice of attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. of New York City, the lawyers who used a similar tactic to get a special prosecutor appointed in the Howard Beach manslaughter case. Cuomo had nothing good to say about those lawyers at an impromptu news conference today. ``They said they had reasons they could not cooperate. ... It's clear now they don't really,'' Cuomo said of the two lawyers. ``These conditions obviously don't mean anything. They keep making up new conditions.'' Maddox and Mason were on the road this morning and not immediately available for comment on Cuomo's statements or today's report in the Middletown Times Herald Record newspaper that Miss Brawley hadn't talked to the lawyers about the case. Cuomo said again today that he was willing to meet with Miss Brawley if it would help push the stalled <b> investigation </b> along. However, he said he would do so only if her lawyers approved and state Attorney General Robert Abrams, Cuomo's special prosecutor in the case, said it would be helpful. In her interview with the Middletown newspaper, Juanita Brawley, who helped raise Tawana for eight years and who has spent time with her since her attack, said she is the only one who knows enough about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girl's mother informed. ``I know a few things that no one else knows,'' she said in an interview at her home. She said of Maddox: ``He has not talked to Tawana. He does not need to talk to Tawana.'' She did not elaborate. On Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said the Brawley family would go to jail before testifying before a grand jury empaneled by Abrams. Sharpton, a minister from New York City who has said he is advising the family, said Cuomo is using ``macho politics'' in trying to compel Tawana's testimony. On Wednesday, Cuomo had called on Abrams to ask a grand jury when it convenes Monday in Poughkeepsie to force Miss Brawley and her family to cooperate with investigators. ``Someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a young girl who has already been abused,'' Sharpton said of Cuomo. This morning, Cuomo said that whatever happened with the grand jury, he thought it was ``very unlikely'' that Tawana would be sent to jail even if she continued her refusal to cooperate with Abrams' investigation. On Thursday, Cuomo had told New York City radio station WLIB that he can't understand why the Brawley family will not cooperate with authorities. ``I see no reason, no common-sense reason, no difficult-to-understand reason, why there is not cooperation,'' Cuomo said. ``At one point you have to ask yourself, why aren't they cooperating with the prosecutors?'' </p> 0.350349098513716  \n",
              "   Highflying former <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> owner Donald Ray Dixon goes on trial Wednesday on charges he used depositors' money to finance lavish acquisitions, leaving taxpayers with a $1.3 billion <b> federal </b> bailout. Dixon, 50, traveled the world for gourmet parties and acquired such trinkets as a 17th Century castle door, Baccarat crystal, Remington sculptures, a silver-studded saddle and a posh house in Solana Beach, Calif., just north of San Diego. The government says those luxuries, as well as payments to prostitutes and political campaigns, were financed from the vaults at Vernon Savings & Loan Association, which collapsed under the weight of Dixon's excess in 1987 and was taken over by the government. A dozen other Vernon executives and associates have preceded Dixon in court; 10 have been convicted and a guilty verdict against two others was set aside because the jury discussed Dixon's indictment. ``Perhaps when my day in court comes, if they'll listen, they'll find out what really happened and the blame can be properly assessed and properly assigned,'' Dixon said in July when he was arraigned on a 38-count indictment. The indictment charged him with conspiracy, misapplication of funds, making false statements and other crimes. Jury selection was to begin Wednesday in <b> federal </b> court. Testimony is expected to begin Monday, and continue three to four weeks. If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be sentenced to up to 190 years in prison and fined as much as $9.5 million. An extra-large panel of 75 to 80 potential jurors was called because of publicity in the case, said Jean Hiller, court coordinator for U.S. District Judge Joe A. Fish. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jarvis of Dallas said 40 to 50 prosecution witnesses could testify. Included on that list is a convicted madam, who has confirmed that she supplied prostitutes for Vernon executives when they were in San Diego. Defense and prosecution attorneys declined to discuss the <b> case </b> this week, citing a instructions from Fish. Until the recent notoriety given Neal Bush and Silverado Savings and Loan in Colorado or Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loan in California, Dixon and Vernon were at or near the top of the list of abuses cited in the industry. Dixon's trial is an effort ``to bring to justice people who break the law, who use <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> associations as personal piggy banks, and who may have thought they could just walk away free and let the American taxpayer shoulder the cost of their greed,'' said Timothy Ryan, Office of Thrift Supervision director in Washington. Vernon had a luxury yacht and a fleet of five planes worth $6 million. The S&L also paid the $22,000 tab for Dixon's gastronomic tour of European restaurants, the government said. Dixon also is charged with illegal contributions to such politicians as former House Speaker Jim Wright and Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York who is now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Recipients of those funds did not know they came from illegal sources, prosecutors have said. When <b> regulators </b> closed Vernon, it was the largest <b> thrift </b> bailout in history, and it remains among the most expensive. Most of the expensive acquisitions have been sold at auction since the government takeover. When <b> regulators </b> closed Vernon, they renamed it Monfort Savings Association. In December 1988, Monfort was one of five insolvent thrifts combined to create First Gibraltar Bank, the largest <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> in Texas. Vernon also has resulted in the stiffest sentence to date for an S&L officer. Former Chairman Woody F. Lemons was sentenced to 30 years in prison earlier this year. </p> </details> \n",

              "   The resignation of Bulgaria's Socialist premier calmed raging anti-Communist sentiment, but it hasn't done anything to solve the country's deep economic and <b> political </b> crisis. Unrelenting pressure from the <b> opposition </b> in Parliament and from strikes and street demonstrations forced Premier Andrei Lukanov and his <b> government </b> of former Communists to leave office on Thursday. Tens of thousands of people cheered in the streets of Sofia, an <b> opposition </b> stronghold. But Lukanov's demise may prove a Pyrrhic victory. The main <b> opposition </b> group, the Union of Democratic Forces, must now prove it can help solve Bulgaria's social and economic woes. ``Not even Jesus can fill Bulgarian stores,'' Lukanov said in a recent speech. A new coalition <b> government </b> probably will be announced next week. So far, nothing has been revealed about who will head it, whether it will be a collection of nonpolitical experts or draw in equal numbers on <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> and the still-powerful Socialists. The Union of Democratic Forces <b> opposition </b> had long criticized Lukanov for mismanagement, demanding that he step down. But it is questionable whether anybody could manage Bulgaria's economy, which is so dependent on the collapsing Soviet bloc that it can only reflect the chaos of that disintegrating alliance. The <b> opposition </b> case against Lukanov always seemed to rest more on a desire to get the former Communists out of office. The opposition, and many of its Western supporters, seemed convinced it would win June elections. When the Socialists won, the <b> opposition </b> formally accepted the result, but has seemed unable to live with it since. Street demonstrations got under way almost immediately, with students around the <b> country </b> occupying universities to force the resignation of Socialist President Petar Mladenov. Mladenov bowed to the pressure in early July. Then it took three weeks of Byzantine <b> political </b> wrangling to get Zhelyu Zhelev, formerly the <b> opposition </b> leader, appointed president. Lukanov, seen by observers as one of the few capable politicians in Bulgaria, was widely credited with persuading the Socialists to accept Zhelev. But the <b> opposition </b> never came through with the tacitly implied second part of the deal: agreement to join the former Communists in Lukanov's government. Backed by some Western diplomats, the <b> opposition </b> apparently felt the Socialists were a spent <b> political </b> force bound to disintegrate. For his part, Lukanov refused to break with the Socialist Party, arguing that it stood for his social <b> democratic </b> ideals. Lukanov eventually appointed an all-Socialist <b> government </b> but continued to battle for broad support, arguing this was vital to a vague but sweeping program of economic reform. Meanwhile, the economy and society slid into chaos. Electricity and food rationing began in Sofia and other cities in September. Stores have grown barer since. Power is now shut off two hours in every four in the capital. The worst outburst of violence came in late August, when an angry crowd invaded Socialist Party headquarters, burning and pillaging several offices. Last week, the <b> opposition </b> took the decisive step of walking out of Parliament. A general strike by the main <b> opposition </b> union this week proved the final blow to the Socialist government. Although the <b> political </b> <b> parties </b> are said to have agreed on a transition <b> government </b> until new <b> elections </b> are held in May, there is virtually no evidence of <b> political </b> unity. The Socialist Party draws on 100 years of tradition and is even older than the Soviet Communist movement, but remains severely split. The unwieldy <b> opposition </b> coalition of 16 <b> parties </b> also is deeply divided, and boasts few figures of Lukanov's caliber. On Friday, Sofia returned to its bitter reality. The shoppers glumly queuing for food know the new <b> government </b> is unlikely to make life much better. ``Even though I am stepping down, my economic and social program has no alternative,'' Lukanov told the Grand National Assembly in his farewell speech Friday. In his last weeks before resigning, Lukanov pushed for radical market-oriented reforms including an austerity budget that would jack up many state-controlled prices, close down unprofitable firms and introduce guarantees for foreign investments. If Bulgaria does not carry out radical reforms soon, it could find itself lagging far behind ``the European train'' of change, Lukanov told reporters. ``I'm afraid we have already missed the train,'' he added. --- EDITORS: Veselin Toshkov, AP correspondent in Sofia, has worked in posts in Bulgaria and abroad for 15 years. </p> 0.431498096259634  \n",
              "   Opposition <b> leaders </b> and Communist officials have tentatively set <b> national </b> <b> elections </b> for June, <b> government </b> television reported. ``According to unofficial information, the first round of (parliamentary) <b> elections </b> should take place on June 8,'' Czechoslovak TV said Thursday. The report came as the Communists, other <b> political </b> <b> parties </b> and the <b> opposition </b> Civic Forum met to review procedures for the <b> elections </b> and the status of independent <b> political </b> parties. ``The draft <b> elections </b> law is aimed at having the <b> elections </b> for the Federal Assembly and both National Councils (parliament) first ... and in the second half of the year the <b> elections </b> to the lower levels of representative bodies should take place,'' the television said.

              "   Efforts to reshape South Korea's faction-ridden politics took a new turn today when President Roh Tae-woo's governing <b> party </b> indicated it would dissolve itself to form a new ``grand'' conservative party. The move by the governing Democratic Justice Party, coupled with strenuous efforts by the two centrist <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> to merge, made the country's <b> political </b> picture complex. ``We will actively respond to moves by the two <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> to merge,'' said the governing party's secretary general, Park Jun-byung. Another Democratic Justice official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``It is possible that we would consider forming a new pan-national, centrist <b> party </b> representing all <b> democratic </b> groups.'' If the new conservative <b> party </b> is formed, the governing <b> party </b> could be folded and its leader, Roh, would give up <b> party </b> membership and stay neutral, the same official said. Kim Young-sam, head of the No. 2 <b> opposition </b> group, said today that he would firm up plans next month to merge his Reunification Democratic Party with the No. 3 <b> opposition </b> group, the New Democratic Republican Party, led by former premier Kim Jong-pil. The two <b> opposition </b> <b> leaders </b> earlier agreed in principle to merge their <b> parties </b> possibly before local elections, scheduled in the first half of this year. ``It would not be a simple merger of two parties. The new <b> party </b> to be born would be a central force comprising all conservative groups,'' Kim Young-sam told reporters. Kim said his ultimate goal is to make the present four-party system into a bipartisan setup. If the two <b> parties </b> merge, it would become the largest <b> opposition </b> group, replacing Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy. The emergence of a centrist <b> opposition </b> <b> party </b> would be welcome news for the governing party, which has been trying to isolate and discredit Kim Dae-jung's liberal, pro-reform party. Kim Dae-jung, holding a news conference today, vehemently opposed the planned merger by his <b> opposition </b> rivals, contending an artificial restructuring of the present four-party system would only benefit Roh's governing party. He said the <b> government </b> camp would try to use the planned <b> opposition </b> merger to seek a conservative alliance, through which it would try to remain in <b> power </b> beyond 1993, when Roh steps down at the end of a single five-year term. Many politicians believe the <b> government </b> camp also favors a <b> political </b> realignment that would enable it to hold onto <b> power </b> as Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party does. If its plan to merge or seek alliance with <b> opposition </b> moderates is successful, the <b> government </b> camp, assured of enough votes in the Assembly, would propose a constitutional amendemnt to change the present presidential system into a Cabinet setup headed by a <b> prime </b> minister, they said. The governing party, with 127 seats in the Assembly, is currently far short of a two-third majority required for a constitutional amendment. South Korea's politics are currently controlled by four main parties, neither of which has a controling majority in the 299-member National Assembly. The three main <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> have a combined majority in the single house but intense rivalry makes it difficult for them to cooperate. At his news conference, Kim Dae-jung said he would try to rally support from ``centrist <b> democratic </b> forces'' to counter moves by his rivals to merge or seek alliance. However, his proposal lacked details. He also reiterated that his <b> party </b> would, if the <b> government </b> endorses the plan, send delegates to <b> communist </b> North Korea in the first half of this year to discuss <b> national </b> unification. If the dispatch of the <b> party </b> delegation is proven successful, Kim said he would visit Pyongyang with <b> government </b> approval to meet with North Korean <b> leader </b> Kim Il Sung He said President Roh responded favorably when he raised the issue last week. But presidential and <b> government </b> officials said the <b> opposition </b> plan to send delegates to the north was premature. </p> 0.395253676640631  \n",
              "   Neil Kinnock, <b> leader </b> of Britain's <b> opposition </b> Labor Party, will be challenged for the post by veteran leftist Tony Benn at the <b> party </b> conference in the fall, a Labor coalition said Wednesday. The Campaign Group, composed of about 40 leftist <b> party </b> lawmakers, said Kinnock's deputy, moderate Roy Hattersley, will be challenged by leftist Eric Heffer. The announcement came after a meeting of the party's <b> national </b> executive committee. Kinnock, 46, and Hattersley are considered not as left wing as Benn and Heffer. Benn, 62, a former Cabinet minister, has accused Kinnock of watering down socialism after the party's three defeats in nine years by the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Kinnock and Hattersley have worked for a united <b> party </b> and cracked down on militants in hopes of making a broader appeal to voters. They say a leadership contest will distract the <b> party </b> from opposing the government. Kinnock and Hattersley denounced the challenge in a joint statement as ``futile and selfish'' and predicted ``massive defeat'' for Benn and Heffer. Benn told reporters: ``Democracy is about choice.''

              "   The University of California at Berkeley, recently disrupted by student protests demanding more <b> minority </b> teachers, has launched a new cultural studies program. Beginning with the freshman class of 1991, all undergraduates will be required to take one course on <b> minority </b> culture. Each of the courses will focus on three <b> minority </b> ethnic groups, said Ron Choy, assistant director of the new program. ``We're creating a whole new <b> program </b> from scratch,'' said Choy, assistant director of the new Center for the Teaching and Study of American Cultures. The center, planned for some time, opened Thursday. Choy said he expects students to welcome the courses, noting the ethnically diverse student body has a strong interest in race and <b> minority </b> reations. Some students boycotted classes for two days last month to protest the lack of ethnic diversity among the faculty. Out of 1,636 full professors, only 24 percent are <b> women </b> or members of <b> minority </b> groups. ``Frankly, this center was created partly to help get the faculty up to date,'' Choy said. ``We have to teach them, too.'' The 1989-90 student body is 45 percent white, 27 percent Asian, 13 percent Hispanic, 8 percent black, 1 percent American Indian and 6 percent undeclared, according to the school. The cultural studies center was created as part of a restructuring of Berkeley's 1960s-era ethnic studies programs, Choy said. ``Most ethnics studies classes just talk about one group,'' he said. ``We want to create new classes that will deal with at least three <b> minority </b> <b> groups </b> at one time in an integrated, comparative way.'' Such an overlapping picture of ethnic <b> groups </b> will better mirror society, he said. </p> 0.333286187168428  \n",
              "   A federal judge apologized Thursday to an attorney he had scolded and threatened with jail when she insisted on using her maiden name and the courtesy title ``Ms.'' in court. ``I have always referred to married <b> women </b> by their married name. This is the way my generation was taught,'' said Senior U.S. District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum, 73. ``I recognize your right to be addressed in any manner in which you see fit, and I apologize for my comments and the resulting situation,'' the judge told Barbara Wolvovitz and three other attorneys involved in the trial of a race <b> discrimination </b> suit against PPG Industries Inc. On July 8, Teitelbaum told Ms. Wolvovitz, whose husband is University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel: ``From here on, in this courtroom you will use Mrs. Lobel. That's your name.'' The judge originally threatened her with jail when she resisted his instruction, and when her co-counsel, Jon Pushinsky, protested, Teitelbaum found him in contempt for ``officious intermeddling'' and gave him a suspended 30-day jail sentence. Ms. Wolvovitz, representing two black <b> men </b> suing PPG, moved Monday for a mistrial, which Teitelbaum rejected. When she again stated her preference, he said: ``What if I call you sweetie?'' The judge said he would settle for calling her ``counselor.'' He also vacated his contempt order for Pushinsky. The jury began deliberations Wednesday afternoon and was still out when the judge made his apology, which was officially entered into court records. Teitelbaum said that if Ms. Wolvovitz still wanted to press for a mistrial, he would grant it before the jury returned with a verdict. Teitelbaum said the parties would be ``stuck with that verdict'' if they declined his offer. The attorneys agreed to not seek a mistrial. Hours later, the jury decided against Ms. Wolvovitz's clients, who had charged they were harassed at work because of their race. Ms. Wolvovitz, 36, who has practiced law for 10 years, and Pushinsky did not want to comment further after the judge's apology, Pushinsky said Thursday. ``I think that he did what he had to do, and thank God he did it,'' said National Organization for Women President Molly Yard, a Pittsburgh resident who is familiar with Teitelbaum. ``I think it's raised everybody's consciousness and that's fine.'' Tom Hollander, president of the Allegheny County Bar Association, said: ``I think it was big of him to apologize.'' JoAnn Dempler, Teitelbaum's law clerk for eight years, said the judge ``is not sexist ... does not discriminate against woman ... does not demean women.'' ``He's a tease,'' she said Thursday. ``His sense of humor is such that he likes to tease and joke and kid around, and if people do not know that, they could easily misconstrue what he's doing or saying. ``Even in court, because we're dealing with very serious matters, every once in a while to just sort of inject a little levity or reduce tension he will make a lighthearted remark, and people who know him realize he doesn't mean to offend anyone,'' Mrs. Dempler said. Teitelbaum said he wasn't teasing when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she would ``sleep in the county jail tonight'' if she refused to be addressed as Mrs. Lobel. ``I unfortunately lost my temper and the matter then got out of hand,'' he said. The judge also said he misstated Pennsylvania law when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she was legally required to use her husband's last name unless she had court permission to do otherwise. ``I was wrong,'' Teitelbaum said. ``I made a mistake.'' </p> 0.332884933072444  \n",

              "   This has been ``a decade of progress for <b> women </b> on television'' _ especially for <b> female </b> characters in prime time _ but the industry must be monitored to ensure further gains, the National Commission on Working Women said. The accolade and note of caution came Tuesday as the commission released a report entitled ``Ten Years in Prime Time: An Analysis of the Image of Women on Entertainment Television, 1979-1988,'' which examined the portrayal of <b> women </b> and compared the fictional panorama with the profile of real-life <b> women </b> during the decade. ``The 1980s mark a decade of progress for <b> women </b> on television. Their portrayals have become more diverse and, for the most part, more true-to-life,'' the report said. ``... The networks get a pat on the back,'' said the study's author, Sally Streenland. The study said 60 percent of <b> female </b> characters on the 25 top Nielsen rated shows in 1979 were portrayed as employed outside the home. By 1987, that figure had risen to 75 percent. By comparison, 1987 <b> population </b> statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau show that 56 percent of all <b> women </b> were in the labor force. Streenland's study also showed TV painting an unrealistically rosy picture of the types of jobs held by women. In 1979, more than 40 percent of television's <b> women </b> were employed in clerical or service jobs. By 1987 only 23 percent of the <b> women </b> on TV had the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional careers. The real life situation is that 47 percent of working <b> women </b> have clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent work in professional or managerial jobs. The report also showed that black <b> women </b> have become more visible on TV. In 1979 there was only one black <b> female </b> character on television, but by 1987, 22 percent of <b> women </b> characters were black. </p> 0.312385004656423  \n",
              "   Authorities are extending mandatory birth control to the far northwest's ethnic minorities, but they will be allowed more children than majority Hans, an official report said Sunday. As of July 1, <b> minority </b> couples in cities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be limited to two children, and those in rural areas will be permitted three, the Xinhua News Agency said. Minority ethnic <b> groups </b> in Xinjiang total 8.6 million, or more than 61 percent of the population, the report said. Most Hans or ethnic Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of China's 1 billion people, are limited to one child with the country struggling to feed and educate its spiraling population. However, the policy has been more relaxed toward China's 56 ethnic <b> minority </b> groups. The different standard toward minorities has been designed in part to win their loyalty to the Han-controlled government and allay their fears of being overwhelmed by ethnic Chinese. </p> </details> \n",

              "   A Playboy <b> magazine </b> photographer will not be allowed to screen Providence College students for a ``Women of the Big East'' pictorial at either the Roman Catholic college or a Providence hotel, officials said. Photographer David Mecey had planned to meet with Providence College students for part of a Big East athletic conference layout scheduled for the April 1989 issue, Playboy spokeswoman Cindy Rakowitz said from New York. Mecey, who planned to stay in Providence from Wednesday through Friday, intended to interview and photograph <b> women </b> in various locations, including the Providence Marriott Inn where he had a reservation. The planned feature would include nude and semi-nude photos. The hotel's name and number were listed on a Playboy leaflet and in a quarter-page advertisement to appear in today's edition of The NewPaper, said Anne Trumbore, an employee at the weekly alternative newspaper. But Stephen McCarthy, the hotel's resident manager, said that when officials realized Wednesday morning who Mecey was, they decided not to allow him to conduct business at the hotel. Mecey was told by <b> hotel </b> officials when he arrived Wednesday night that he could not conduct interviews on <b> hotel </b> property. ``If he wants to stay here, he can. He has rented a room and we are in the business of renting rooms,'' said general manager Rene Neidhart. ``But he did not have our authorization to use our name in any advertisements, and he cannot interview or photograph in the hotel.'' ``I'm not entirely taken aback, but I think that's pretty drastic,'' said Rakowitz when informed of the Marriott's decision. ``That's sort of eliminating the rights of the individual to make a freedom of choice _ but a <b> hotel </b> is private property.'' Playboy also was banned from interviewing or staying at the Sheraton Tara in Braintree, Mass., when it interviews Boston College students in mid-November, said Jeff Cohen, Playboy's managing photo editor. Some people who arrived at the Marriott looking for Mecey were escorted off <b> hotel </b> property by security guards, said McCarthy. He said several people, both <b> women </b> and men, were removed from the lobby and floors. Playboy had decided against seeking the cooperation of administrators at any of the schools it will visit, deciding instead to advertise off-campus and in college newspapers. Playboy had hoped to run an ad in the Cowl, the student <b> newspaper </b> at the 3,800-student college, but students and administrators decided against it, said a school spokesman, the Rev. John McGreevy. Officials at St. John's University in New York, another Catholic school, decided earlier this month against running an <b> article </b> about the Playboy feature in its student newspaper. ``I'm still confident that we will recruit our women,'' said Rakowitz, who said about 20 <b> women </b> were wanted for the feature. ``I've never come into a problem at a hotel. I think it's sort of repressing.'' Other schools in the Big East Conference are Villanova University, in Villanova, Pa.; Washington's Georgetown University; Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J.; the University of Connecticut; the University of Pittsburgh; and New York's Syracuse University. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Authorities moved to placate separatist Moslem <b> militants </b> Monday by dissolving the legislative assembly of Jammu-Kashmir <b> state </b> and acknowledging that the 1987 polls in which it was elected might have been rigged. Also Monday, at least three <b> people </b> were <b> killed </b> and six injured in confrontations between security forces and Moslem protesters agitating for the secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-majority India. State Gov. Jagmohan said the Jammu-Kashmir assembly was being dissolved because it had ``lost its representative character.'' The move clears the way for new elections to the assembly, which could form the basis for making peace overtures to the militants. Many of the <b> militants </b> say they were members of political parties earlier, and began agitating for an independent nation after what they claim was widespread rigging during the 1987 elections. ``It has been alleged that in 1987 some vested interests had rigged the election,'' Jagmohan said in a statement issued in Srinagar. In those elections, Farooq Abdullah was voted the chief minister, the top elected post in the <b> state </b> administration, for a five-year term. Abdullah resigned from the post on Jan. 19 to protest the appointment of Jagmohan as governor of the state. Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, has said that quelling militant violence and holding new elections is the only way to defuse the separatist movement in the Moslem-majority state. Police reported at least three deaths Monday as Moslem crowds violated curfew orders in two towns in the valley. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two <b> people </b> were <b> killed </b> and six injured when police opened fire to control a rioting mob in the town of Bijbehara, 30 <b> miles </b> southeast of Srinagar. One person was <b> killed </b> in the town of Shopian, 33 <b> miles </b> south of Srinagar, in another incident of police firing, they said. The deaths raise to at least 103 the number of <b> people </b> <b> killed </b> since authorities launched a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20. Most of the victims have been protesters <b> killed </b> in police firing on curfew violators. The movement for secession of Kashmir from India is at least four decades old, but has flared in recent months. The <b> state </b> of Jammu-Kashmir, which includes the valley and the plains of Jammu to the south, is India's only Moslem-majority state. India and Pakistan have both claimed Kashmir since the Indian subcontinent was divided along religious lines after gaining independence from Britain in 1947. The countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, and Pakistan occupies a slice of the valley. A U.N.-monitored cease-fire line divides the valley into Indian and Pakistani sectors. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the trouble in Kashmir. Islamabad denies the charge but says the Kashmri <b> people </b> have a right to self-determination. About 64 <b> percent </b> of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 <b> percent </b> of the 880 <b> million </b> population. Hindus make up 82 percent. </p> 0.562268472012152  \n",
              "   Three Sinhalese <b> extremists </b> and a soldier were <b> killed </b> and <b> militants </b> torched buses on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence, police said today. Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in Colombo, the capital, and its surburbs. Police said <b> people </b> were afraid to open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed to the Indian-brokered peace accord. A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the island's south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike. Residents in the northern city of Vavuniya, about 125 <b> miles </b> northeast of Colombo, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also declared curfews in some areas in the island's north and east until Sunday morning to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels. The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for five years for independence in the north and east of the island and by the Peoples Liberation Front, an extremist group from the island's majority Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority, while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for independence. Three men were <b> killed </b> by police in separate incidents in which Sinhalese <b> extremists </b> tried to attack <b> government </b> property, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said a Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with <b> extremists </b> in Hambantota district in the south. In southern and central Sri Lanka, strongholds of the Sinhalese extremists, at least eight government-owned buses were set afire Thursday night and this morning, the police spokesman said. Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern Sri Lanka were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese <b> extremists </b> bew up electrical transformers, he said. A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a firebomb as it pulled into Colombo, police said. Only a few government-owned or private buses were seen running. In the island's north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called for a demonstration to protest the peace pact. On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were <b> killed </b> by Tamil rebels near Padaviya village, about 100 <b> miles </b> northeast of Colombo. The peace accord, signed by India and Sri Lanka on July 29, 1987, calls for the <b> government </b> to grant limited autonomy to minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight for a separate Tamil nation. India agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, refused to accept the accord. India is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its own Tamil minority of 60 <b> million </b> for the island conflict. Before the peace pact was signed, Sri Lanka regularly accused India of training and supplying the rebels. More than 8,000 <b> people </b> have been <b> killed </b> since the ethnic war began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 <b> percent </b> of Sri Lanka's 16 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75 <b> percent </b> and control the <b> government </b> and the army. More than 400 <b> people </b> have been <b> killed </b> since the accord was signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists. Most of the victims have been <b> government </b> officials or members of the governing United National Party of President Junius R. Jayewardene, who signed the accord. </p> 0.551098179376065  \n",
              "   Eight bombs exploded today in the stronghold of Moslem <b> militants </b> seeking independence for the Himalayan valley of Kashmir, authorities said. No one was injured. Authorities said the blasts, at two banks, a post office and other shops and businesses, occurred hours after fire swept through a shopping complex in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. No one claimed responsibilty for the explosions. Police said they believe the blaze was an accident since it occurred before dawn while a curfew was still in force. But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed the fire and the bombs on the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, the militant group leading the four-decade-old drive for the country's only Moslem majority <b> state </b> to secede from predominantly Hindu India. India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but says the Kashmiri <b> people </b> have a right to self-determination. At least 82 <b> people </b> have been <b> killed </b> since Jan. 20 in frequent street clashes between <b> militants </b> and security forces in Srinagar and adjoining areas. Most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying curfew imposed by <b> government </b> forces to stem rising violence. The curfew was relaxed during the day from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m., except in the areas where the explosions occurred. Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir. Sixty-four <b> percent </b> of the state's 5 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> are Moslems, but Moslems make up 12 <b> percent </b> of the 880 <b> million </b> population nationwide. Kashmiri <b> militants </b> had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population, but the <b> militants </b> now demand independence and the status of a neutral country.

              "   Police today detained about 10,000 Hindu students on their way to a protest rally in the Kashmir Valley, where a day earlier 21 Moslems were <b> killed </b> in a reported shootout. The caravan of buses and trucks that was stopped in Udhampur, 45 <b> miles </b> north of Jammu, was headed toward Srinagar, where the Hindu activists of the All India Students' Federation had planned to hoist Indian flags. The government, fearing violence, had appealed to the Hindu activists not to hold their procession to Srinagar, a Moslem stronghold in Kashmir, the northern sector of Jammu-Kashmir state. The students, based in Jammu in a predominantly Hindu sector, had ignored the official pleas. The Hindu students are opposed to a Moslem secessionist movement that is attempting to get independence for Jammu-Kashmir state, the only Indian <b> state </b> in which the majority of the population is Moslem. The students were arrested without resistance, one official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. They were expected to be released after a few hours without charges being pressed. In Srinagar, shops were closed and traffic stayed off the roads today in response to a general strike call given by Moslem militants. The strike was to protest the deaths of 21 Kashmiris Tuesday during a shoot-out with paramiltary troops near Srinagar. The <b> government </b> claimed all the victims, including 17 <b> people </b> in a bus which exploded and caught fire, were militants.

              "   A bomb hidden in a motor scooter exploded in a crowded vegetable market in Punjab <b> state </b> today, killing at least 31 <b> people </b> and wounding 70 others as Hindus celebrated a religious holiday, police said. The bombing, which police blamed on Sikh separatists, raised to 39 the number <b> killed </b> since Monday in the northern state. Sikhs campaigning for a separate nation have <b> killed </b> more than 500 <b> people </b> so far this year in Punjab, a rich northern farming <b> state </b> where they hold a slight majority over Hindus. Soon after the blast in Batala, 25 <b> miles </b> north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, Hindu mobs hurled stones at a police station 150 yards from the vegetable market, senior police superintendent S.K. Goel said. Goel was unsure whether any policemen were injured. The violence prompted officials to impose an indefinite curfew on the city, he said, adding that ``the situation is very tense.'' Most of those <b> killed </b> were Hindus and the wounded included both Sikhs and Hindus, said Sanjeev Gupta, another senior police official. Thirty-two of those wounded were in serious condition. Goel said the bomb exploded during a march by about 100,000 Hindus celebrating the birth of Rama, a heroic warrior-king. Rama is extolled in Hindu lore as an incarnation of Vishnu, a member of the supreme Hindu trinity of gods. Witnesses, contacted by telephone, said portions of bodies were hurled across the market, which was covered with blood-soaked pieces of vegetables. ``Some <b> people </b> were crying for help. Those who were lucky to survive ran away in panic. Many shops, scooters and one car were destroyed,'' said one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier today, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near Amritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, both Sikhs, senior police superintendent Anil Sharma said. Police blamed Sikh <b> extremists </b> for the blast near Taragarh, 17 <b> miles </b> northeast of Amritsar. Sikh Extremists initially targeted only Hindus in their campaign but now have also turned their guns on Sikhs who don't support the separatist cause. On Monday night, Sikh <b> militants </b> shot and <b> killed </b> four members of a Sikh family in another part of Punjab, police said. At Salghowal, 95 <b> miles </b> southeast of Amritsar, five or six Sikh gunmen burst into the farmhouse of a Sikh constable Monday night, killing the policeman, his parents and a younger brother, senior police superintendent Baramjit Singh said. Police also blamed Sikh <b> extremists </b> for an attack on a bus Monday night in Uttar Pradesh state, which is separated from Punjab by Haryana state, news agencies reported. United News of India said one police guard was <b> killed </b> and 11 passengers were wounded when five gunmen stopped the bus. But a second police guard <b> killed </b> one of the gunmen and the others fled, according to United News. Press Trust of India said police recovered a Chinese assault rifle bearing the inscription ``Khalistan Commando Force.'' Khalistan, which means ``Land of the Pure,'' is the name Sikh <b> militants </b> use for the independent Sikh nation they want to create in Punjab. The bus was halted while traveling between Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar, about 75 <b> miles </b> northeast of New Delhi and about 95 <b> miles </b> from the Punjab-Haryana <b> state </b> line. Most attacks by Sikh <b> extremists </b> have occurred in Punjab. Nationwide, Sikhs comprise only 2 <b> percent </b> of India's 880 <b> million </b> people, while Hindus account for 82 percent.

              "   The two Koreas met on the soccer field at Olympic Stadium today before more than 80,000 South Koreans, who cheered for both teams and roared approval for unification. South Korea's national <b> team </b> won 1-0, but the score was insignificant beside the diplomatic coup in having two enemy nations share a playing field for only the second time since World War II. The first time was two weeks ago in North Korea, when the northern <b> team </b> beat the <b> south </b> 2-1. Today's crowd was the largest to see a South Korean <b> sports </b> event since the 1988 Olympic Games. At the end of the game, spectators rose for a standing ovation as the athletes jogged around the stadium holding hands and waving. The teams exchanged shirts and waved them in the air. ``Our wish is unification,'' blared a unification song over the loudspeakers. The game, called North-South Unification Soccer, is the high point of a five-day <b> visit </b> by a 78-member North Korean <b> sports </b> delegation, the first from the Communist <b> north </b> to <b> visit </b> the <b> south </b> since the 1945 division of the peninsula. South Korean soccer players visited the <b> north </b> earlier this month. That <b> visit </b> was only the second civilian exchange between the countries in more than four decades. The soccer <b> delegation </b> returns to North Korea on Friday after rounds of sightseeing, dinners and <b> talks </b> on future <b> sports </b> exchanges. South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong Sung and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, agreed in principle to form a joint single <b> team </b> for the 1992 Olympic Games and other international <b> sports </b> events at <b> talks </b> in Pyongyang. They said further discussions would be held in Seoul. About 5,000 plainclothes police were positioned inside and outside the stadium. Spectators were searched twice and passed through metal detectors to get to their seats. Scalpers were asking $140 for tickets, 10 times the highest face value price. The teams of the rival Koreas entered the stadium side by side, holding hands and waving to thunderous applause. ``This is not purely <b> sports </b> festival,'' Kim said before the match began. ``It should lead to a unification festival.'' ``I hope this soccer match will be a spring board for national unification,'' Chung. Thousands roared in approval and waved colorful pompons. Spectators had been asked not to bring national flags, decorative placards or other paraphernalia which would be identified only with South Korea. A drum and bugle corps played and a gigantic electric signboard flashed the pictures of the ministers. The North Korean <b> team </b> threw half a dozen soccer balls signed with their signatures into the grandstand and screaming spectators raced to retrieve them. During the game, the South Korean crowd cheered wildly for plays by both teams. Radical students, who had said they would root for the North Korean visitors, were not visible. News reports said tickets were sold on an individual basis apparently to avoid large radical or dissident groups sitting together. The <b> sports </b> exchange comes at a time when South Korea and North Korea are seeking to find ways to ease tensions and work together for unification. The prime ministers of both Koreas met for the second time last week in Pyongyang, the north's capital, and have agreed to meet again in Seoul in December. A South Korean musicians' <b> delegation </b> returns Wednesday from a 10-day <b> visit </b> to the north. The Korean <b> peninsula </b> was divided into the Communist North and capitalist South in 1945 at the end of the World War II. The two nations fought a <b> war </b> in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was never signed. The border between the Koreas <b> remains </b> tightly sealed and is one of the most heavily fortified demarcations in the world with more than 1.5 million troops on either side. </p> 0.486592565118984  \n",
              "   Last month, Communist North Korea turned over what it said were the <b> remains </b> of five U.S. servicemen killed in the Korean War. Now American officials say they're not sure whose <b> remains </b> they have. The <b> remains </b> were handed over to to a U.S. congressional <b> delegation </b> in an emotional Memorial Day ceremony in the truce village of Panmunjom in what was billed as the first return of U.S. Korean War dead since 1954. Only two of the five bodies were identified by name by the North Koreans, based on dogtags they said were found with them. They were U.S. Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah and Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, of Chester, Pa. But the United Nations Command said today that the bodies, which were sent to the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu for identification, were not those of Saunders and Seaton. ``While North Korea has indicated name association for two of the five remains, dental and physical characteristics of the <b> remains </b> were compared with the dental and physical records of the those two individuals, with negative results,'' the command said. The command said its findings were preliminary, but said it did not appear that the other <b> remains </b> returned were those of Saunders or Seaton either. ``Until the identification process is complete, we can't even be sure they were the <b> remains </b> of Americans,'' the command added. The soldiers' relatives have been told of the findings, the command said. The other three sets of <b> remains </b> were not identified by North Korea, but it said at the time of the return that they were believed to be those of another Army servicemen and two U.S. Air Force members. All five were believed to have been prisoners of <b> war </b> who died in Hwanghae Pukto province, <b> south </b> of North Korea's capital of Pyongyang. Saunders and Seaton had been listed as missing in February 1951, the Pentagon said. According to U.S. military, 8,172 U.S. soldiers remain unaccounted for from the war. The return of the <b> remains </b> was widely seen as a sign of healing and reconciliation after decades of emnity, an effort by North Korea to improve relations with the United States. The two countries do not have diplomatic ties. The United Nations Command says 33,629 U.S. soldiers were killed and 103,284 wounded in the war. More than 2 million Koreans were killed. The 16-nation command, led by an American general, was formed at the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War to help South Korea repel invaders from the North. There were large-scale returns of <b> remains </b> of U.S. <b> war </b> dead in 1953 and 1954. Then, after years of no returns, the North Koreans announced May 14 that they would turn over the <b> remains </b> of the five. Ho Jong, North Korean's deputy permanant representative at its U.N. mission, said at the time that the Communist government was prepared to discuss the return of more remains. He said the move was an ``eloquent illustration'' of North Korea's wilingness to ``settle pending issues with the U.S. government in a good way.'' North Korea acknowledged for the first time in January 1988 that it was still holding the <b> remains </b> of U.N. Command <b> war </b> dead. </p> 0.439376559501793  \n",
              "   Communist North Korea on Friday offered to open a small stretch of its border to promote unification with South Korea, but its capitalist rival dismissed the gesture as insignificant. The Communist overture came as the prime ministers of the two nations prepared to hold historic talks, perhaps as early as August. North Korea announced it would open the northern sector of Panmunjom, a border village, on Aug. 15, according to Naewoe Press, a semi-official South Korean news agency that specializes in Communist affairs. North Korea said the opening, about 800 yards long and 500 yards wide, was aimed at promoting unification of the Korean <b> peninsula </b> and urged South Korea to do the same, according to Naewoe. ``For successful progress of contact and visits between the <b> north </b> and the south, we will open the portion of our side ... and hope that the <b> south </b> side will take a corresponding measure,'' the agency quoted the Communist government as saying. The opening, however, would not permit foreigners to travel inland, past the perimeter of Panmunjom, a truce village that straddles part of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas. The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a United Nations Command, comprising the United States and 15 other countries that fought with South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. No civilians may enter the area from either side without approval. South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had not been officially notified of the north's plans and would not comment on whether anyone would be allowed to cross the border. But a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity that North Korea's move was ``insignificant'' because it affected only a small, restricted section of the heavily fortified border. Other officials said the move was aimed at dividing opinions in South Korea, where dissidents are pushing for free contacts with their Communist neighbors. The South Korean opposition welcomed the announcement. Dissidents asked Seoul to allow 300 people to meet with North Koreans at the border village Aug. 15, the day in 1945 that Korea was freed from Japanese colonial rule. But a spokesman for South Korea's umbrella dissident group, Chonminyon, said the Seoul response had been negative. The South Korean government bans unauthorized border <b> talks </b> with North Korea. After a five-month suspension, South Korean and North Korean officials have been meeting to discuss an accord that would outline terms for the first <b> talks </b> between their prime ministers. On Tuesday, the Koreas agreed in principle to hold the prime ministers' meeting, possibly in August in Seoul. They agreed to adopt a formal accord July 26. Talks have been held sporadically between the two Koreas, but little progress had been made until recently. The border on both sides is heavily fortified and sealed, blocking exchanges of mail and transportation. North Korea is one of the last totalitarian Communist states, and sweeping changes in Eastern Europe and its socialist allies have made little impact. The two Koreas are still technically at war. No peace treaty has been signed since the three-year Korean War ended in 1953. </p> 0.433794463538924  \n",
              "   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today accused North Korea of trying to disrupt the Olympic Games and said the United States would beef up its military forces to stop any threat. ``Let me assure you that we will do all we can to help ensure the security of the 1988 Summer Olympics Games,'' he said. Communist North Korea continues to threaten peace on the divided Korean <b> peninsula </b> by refusing to work with South Korea to defuse the tension, Carlucci said. ``It is most unfortunate that the <b> north </b> continues its trouble-making role and <b> remains </b> unwilling to make the simple concessions necessary to bring about a reduction in tensions on the peninsula,'' he said. Carlucci gave the assurance to South Korean defense officials at the start of the 20th annual U.S.-South Korea security conference to discuss mutual defense. South Korea Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok also stressed the North Korean threat to the <b> south </b> and said the Olympics was adding to the tension. ``With the danger of their scheme to disrupt the coming Olympics remaining undiminished, military tension between <b> south </b> and <b> north </b> on the peninsla continues, thus posing a grave threat to the stability of Northeast Asia,'' he said. U.S. and South Korean delegates agreed during the <b> talks </b> to build up their early warning systems to detect any possible North Korean military threat. Up to three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will help provide security for the Games, officials said. North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the demand, saying the Games are awarded to a single city. The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter opponents that have clashed repeatedly. The United States has about 42,000 U.S. troops based in the <b> south </b> under a mutual defense pact. After meeting with Oh, Carlucci had lunch with President Roh Tae-woo and was awarded the Order of National Security. His scheduled visits later in the day with frontline American and South Korean troops were canceled due to bad weather, officials said. </p> </details> \n",

The five were charged with criminal association of a Mafia type and with illegal possession of firearms. They are reputed leaders of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia. Authorities said the five met at the apartment of the boss of one Camorra gang and that the apartment had been under surveillance for months. The five were identified as Antonio Egizio, 35; his brother Umberto Egizio, 24; Vincenzo Romano, 28; Vincenzo de Michele, 36; and Salvatore Manna, 44.

              "   Reputed mob boss John Gotti was described as ``God's gift to the underworld'' in tapes secretly recorded by law enforcement agents and played Wednesday to jurors at his assault and conspiracy trial. Prosecutors say Gotti, 49, became boss of the Gambino <b> crime </b> family, largest of New York's five Mafia factions, in December 1985 after then-boss Paul Castellano was gunned down in front of a steak house. Transcripts of the tapes, which were released to the news media, show Gotti concerned about keeping underlings, including lifelong friends, in their place. At least once on the tapes, Gotti uses the term ``Cosa Nostra' when he is apparently telling an unidentified man that mob soldiers should not address him directly on business matters but should go through their ``capos,'' or captains. The tapes also indicate a relationship with the Westies, a vicious Irish-American gang that operates on Manhattan's West Side. The Westies are a key factor in Gotti's trial with associate Anthony Guerrieri, 60, on charges of assault and conspiracy in the 1986 revenge shooting of John F. O'Connor, former vice president of a Carpenters Union local. Gotti is accused of commissioning the Westies to shoot and wound O'Connor because the union leader had thugs trash a restaurant owned by Gotti associate Philip ``Philly'' Modica. The transcripts show at least one mention by Gotti of the restaurant and several comments on the Westies. At one point Gotti says ``...they're doing something for me them Irish guys...,'' but does not say what. At another point, Gotti refers to James Coonan as ``my friend'' who is ``the leader of the West Side gang, Irish guys.'' He also says, ``He's on the payroll, and he gets it legitimately ...'' The tapes were introduced by Edward Wright, an investigator with the state's Organized Crime Task Force. Wright said the alleged mobsters, suspecting they might be under surveillance, turned on hair dryers, flushed toilets, whispered and used other means to try to make conversations inaudible. The tapes were made from listening devices placed in Gotti's hangout in the borough of Qeens and monitored by police between June 19, 1985, and Feb. 26, 1986. More than 1,000 cassettes were recorded, prosecutors say. One 1986 tape shows Gotti in a telephone conversation quoting someone who praised him: ``When they say God's gift to the underworld, you are it. ``He speaks with his heart,'' Gotti said on the telephone. ``He means it. I tell ya something, I love the guy.'' On another tape, Gotti expressed annoyance with lifelong friend Angelo Ruggiero for his familiarity during business hours. ``I told Ange, `You gotta forget them liberties you take. Take `em when we're alone,''' Gotti said. Gotti apparently had just made Ruggiero a ``caporegime,'' or crew captain, according to the tape transcripts, and was not satisfied that his friend was acting like a leader. Ruggiero, a defendant in the O'Connor case with Gotti, died of natural causes last month. </p> 0.317650341569912  \n",
              "   The Town Council has resigned to protest reports its members are suspected of ties with the Mafia. The councilmen followed the lead of the mayor, Paolo Scarna. He quit after a nephew was suspected of killing a judge last month who was ruling on whether purported Mafia members should be kept under house arrest, news reports said Friday. The resignations of the 32 council members came amid reports that police were investigating local politicians for possible links with organized crime. The town of 25,000 people, one of the poorest in Sicily, is in the province of Agrigento, an area that over the last few years has seen many slayings linked to the mob, including the murder of two anti-Mafia magistrates. Italy's top anti-Mafia fighter, Magistrate Domenico Sica, has looked into possible Mafia activity in the town. In Palermo, meanwhile, officials announced on Friday that police have arrested 12 people suspected of drug-trafficking and money-laundering. The arrests came in a nationwide sweep that began Thursday night and involved searches of houses and business offices in Palermo, Rome, Milan and the northern cities of Como and Asti, police officials said. Those arrested were held for investigation of suspected organized <b> crime </b> ties that involved drug dealing and money laundering. Investigators said they were aided by the testimony of a former mobster-turned-informer and by the discovery in January of a ledger that police say contained entries on Mafia financial transactions. The ledger was found in the house of a fugitive suspected Mafia boss. The drugs appeared to have moved directly from Turkey to Sicily and the drug profits appeared to have been laundered through Swiss banks, the Italian news agency AGI reported. </p> 0.313418487504187  \n",
              "   Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, a close friend and adviser of Premier Ciriaco De Mita, was shot to death Saturday at his home in northern Italy. An anonymous caller said Red Brigades terrorists were responsible. Investigators told Italian news agencies the body of the 51-year-old Christian Democrat senator was found on a couch in his living room at Forli, 40 miles southeast of Bologna. They said he was shot in the back of the neck. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said an anonymous telephone caller to the Bologna office of the Rome newspaper La Repubblica asserted responsibility on behalf of the Red Brigades. The spokesman quoted the caller as saying, ``We have killed Senator Ruffilli, attacking at the heart of the state. Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party.'' President Francesco Cossiga said: ``Our institutions and all the forces that are alive in the country will know how to act with firmness for the defense of liberty and of right. ``The assassination of Sen. Roberto Ruffilli is a horrendous <b> crime </b> against the most sacred of human values _ life. It is an abominable attack on the parliamentary and representative institutions which are the fulcrum of our democratic state.'' Maurizio Laudi, a magistrate who has investigated the terrorist group, was quoted by the news agency AGI as saying the Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party is the most dangerous and active group in what remains of the Red Brigades. He said it also is the most difficult to penetrate. AGI said Ruffilli had received threatening phone calls in recent days. He led the Christian Democrat committee on problems of the state and was working with the premier on institutional reform. Ruffilli also was on the parliamentary commission that investigated the P-2 Masonic Lodge scandal. Premier De Mita convened a special meeting Saturday night of Interior Minister Antonio Gava and the chiefs of the Italy's police forces. ``The criminal warning of the terrorists could not have been any clearer,'' he said. ``It has the same clarity with which 10 years ago through the person of Aldo Moro they aimed at his political program.'' Red Brigades terrorists kidnapped and killed Moro, a former premier, in 1978. According to the news agency ANSA, investigators at Ruffilli's home found the door open and no signs of forced entry. State-run RAI television said the assassins fled on foot after the shooting at about 1 p.m. In a dispatch quoting government sources it did not identify, AGI said the car bombing that killed five people and wounded 17 at a Naples club for U.S. military personnel Thursday night may have inspired terrorists to kill Rufilli. An American servicewoman and four Italians were killed in the blast. The murder of air force Gen. Licio Giorgieri in Rome on March 20, 1987, was the last terrorist act for which a branch of the Red Brigades claimed responsibility. A month before that, the Red Brigades for the Formation of Fighting Communist Party claimed responsibility for an armored car robbery in Rome. In December 1981, Red Brigade terrorists disguised as plumbers kidnapped U.S. Brig. Gen. James Dozier, who was with the NATO command in Italy, from his home in Verona. He was rescued 42 days later by a special police unit in Padua. In February 1984, terrorists in Rome fatally shot Leamon Hunt, a U.S. diplomat and director-general of the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. The Red Brigades claimed responsibility. </p> 0.301221604585091  \n",
              "   The bulk of one of the world's most important private art collections will hang in Spain for at least 10 years under an agreement signed Thursday. The arrival of 700 to 800 of the $2 billion Thyssen collection's most significant paintings will cement the Spanish capital's reputation as a leading world art center. The agreement was signed by collector Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and the Spanish government. The ceremony took place across the street from Prado museum in the 19th-century Villahermosa Palace, which Spanish authorities are refurbishing to devote exclusively to the new works. The collection is expected to open to the public in November. Thyssen said his decision to chose Spain over museums in the United States, Switzerland and West Germany was ``completely objective'' but stressed that his ties to Spain played a deciding role. The Baron's fifth wife, Spanish-born Carmen Cervera, was an important factor in the final decision, according one of the plan's chief architects, the Duke of Badajoz, who also is the brother-in-law of King Juan Carlos. Cervera, a former beauty queen and widow of ``Tarzan'' actor Lex Barker, ``has a great influence over her husband,'' he said. The duke said Thyssen had not yet completed the choice of which paintings would make up the Madrid collection, but the agreement stipulates they include ``the most significant paintings'' of the Thyssen collection. The duke said the 10-year loan agreement paves the way for a second pact to make Spain the collection's permanent home. ``It takes away a bit of the tension,'' he said. ``Now we can proceed with calm to work out the definitive agreement.'' A beaming Culture Minister Javier Solana said the collection ``is going to fundamentally improve the cultural life of our country.'' The Swiss-based Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Trust, headed by the baron, owns 1,600 paintings from the 13th to 20th centuries, including 570 old masters. The collection was started by his father, Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a German steel baron who died in 1947. News that Thyssen was looking for a bigger home for the bulk of the paintings currently housed at his Villa Favorita residence in Lugano, Switzerland, elicited offers from Spain, the Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., and museums in several West German cities. The 10-year loan is to be administered by a private foundation set up by the Spanish government and Thyssen, and chaired by the baron. The agreement stipulates that the pieces on loan to Spain will be able to travel freely to other museums without prior approval from Spanish authorities. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Former President Carter described Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis as ``highly competent'' on Tuesday and said Dukakis would fare well against Republican George Bush in the Nov. 8 general election. ``I know him well. He and I were governors together,'' said Carter, who was governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and won the presidency in 1976. Carter said the Massachusetts governor ``is highly competent. I think among all the governors, he would be voted one of the top ones in administrative ability, in vision and competence and sound judgment.'' Carter said Dukakis' nomination was ``the obvious likelihood now'' and predicted ``he will do well'' against Bush. As a former Democratic president, Carter is a delegate to the <b> convention </b> in Atlanta this summer. He said it is still his intention to go to the <b> convention </b> as an uncommitted delegate because he <b> told </b> the candidates earlier that he would not choose among them until the convention. </p> 0.51658736644396  \n",
              "   Illinois Republican Gov. James Thompson came to this <b> convention </b> city to taunt the Democrats, but wound up hinting that he'd make a good <b> running </b> mate for GOP candidate George Bush. As the Democrats embraced the ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, who differ on a number of issues, Thompson stressed his compatibility with the <b> vice </b> president. ``George Bush and I agree on a lot of things,'' said Thompson, a four-term governor who was an early Bush supporter. ``I'm too moderate for some people, but I've never been <b> told </b> I'm too moderate for George Bush,'' he said. Thompson was careful to avoid sounding overly eager as a job applicant. Vice <b> presidential </b> hopefuls traditionally refrain from tooting their own horns. ``There are a number of qualified candidates,'' Thompson said. ``There's no lack of talent in our party.'' Thompson's <b> support </b> gave Bush a boost in the Illinois primary, where he thrashed his GOP rivals after an impressive showing in the South. Since then, Thompson has been mentioned as a <b> vice </b> <b> presidential </b> prospect, and ``Thompson-Bush'' bumper stickers have appeared in Springfield, the Illinois capital. Thompson was in Atlanta on Wednesday to carry the GOP banner. He clearly relished the task, signaling what's certain to be a Republican effort to focus attention on Jesse Jackson as part of the Democratic team. ``Gov. Dukakis has accepted Jesse Jackson as his partner in this campaign, elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps higher than his nominal <b> running </b> mate, Lloyd Bentsen,'' Thompson <b> told </b> reporters. Thompson said it was a clever strategy by Dukakis to offer Bentsen as ``the soothing, reassuring conservative.'' But he said, ``my guess is those two partners of the troika, Dukakis and Jackson, will soon leave Bentsen in the dust.'' Thompson added: ``With Bentsen whispering in one ear and Jackson whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen to? ... I think that's the question the American people need to have answered.'' </p> 0.498473725482628  \n",
              "   Talk of a brokered <b> convention </b> is making some Democrats shudder, while former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill says he thinks it would be a lot of fun and other party leaders say the scenario probably will be avoided one way or another. ``A brokered <b> convention </b> is nothing,'' said O'Neill on Wednesday evening. He recalled the brokered 1952 <b> convention </b> that nominated Adlai Stevenson and said, ``It was enjoyable ... it makes it more fun.'' ``If I had my way _ they talk about the smoke-filled rooms _ we ought to open them up to the TV and the press,'' he said in an interview Wednesday night. Sen. Paul Simon's favorite-son <b> primary </b> victory in Illinois on Tuesday brought the brokered <b> convention </b> speculation to the fore, along with concerns that the Democrats could only be hurt by such a lack of unity. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who some hope would emerge the nominee if there were a deadlocked convention, condemned the possibility as ``the best way to give this election away to the Republicans.'' He joined Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk in calling for the Democratic leadership to unify behind the front-runner when the <b> primary </b> season ends in June, rather than wait until the July <b> convention </b> in Atlanta. Simon, reviving his faltering campaign, took most of the <b> delegates </b> in Illinois, with the other home-state candidate, Jesse Jackson, coming in second and taking the rest of the delegates. Simon said no one will have enough <b> delegates </b> to lock up the nomination before the convention, and added, ``We're going to have to work out some kind of a compromise.'' Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who currently holds a slim lead in delegates, said the party should unite behind the front-runner at the end of the <b> primary </b> season, and that encouraging a brokered <b> convention </b> ``would be a very dangerous thing.'' ``I think there is agreement on the part of most Democrats across the country that somebody will come out of this <b> primary </b> process with, if not an absolute majority, a substantial plurality ... and that people will rally behind that person. Obviously, I hope I will be that person,'' the governor said in Boston. But other prominent Democrats, interviewed Wednesday at a congressional dinner, professed not to be worried about the deadlocked <b> convention </b> prospect, mostly because they don't think it will come to that. ``Nobody said the process had to end by March,'' said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But he said he thinks his candidate, Dukakis, will have enough <b> delegates </b> to take the nomination by June, and that ``the process is going to work its way out.'' Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, who opted not to seek the <b> presidential </b> nomination this year, said he doubts anyone will have a winning cache of <b> delegates </b> in June. But he predicted that the party would unite behind a candidate before the convention. Nonetheless, he added, ``I don't fear a brokered <b> convention </b> ... I don't think any harm comes from it.'' After Illinois, Dukakis had 464.5 delegate votes, Jackson 460.55 and Simon 171.5. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee had 354.8 and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri 145. Uncommitted <b> delegates </b> totaled 272.65 of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination. Boosted by his Illinois win, Simon plans to <b> campaign </b> vigorously for the upcoming Michigan caucuses March 26 and the Wisconsin <b> primary </b> April 5. Gore, who fared poorly in Illinois, said he is ``almost prepared'' to agree that the race will still be fluid at the convention. ``I still think this process is likely to produce a winner before the first ballot is over,'' Gore said. ``The results (from Illinois) ... make it more likely we will go to a second ballot.'' Gephardt, who skipped Illinois to try to resuscitate his <b> campaign </b> in Michigan, said the Democratic battle could go all the way. ``The race is wide open,'' he said in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``I think if I can get a good result in Michigan, which I think I can, I'm going to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great chance to be the nominee.'' House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said Wednesday night he anticipated he would be involved in any discussions to unite behind a candidate before the <b> convention </b> if no one had the winning number of <b> delegates </b> in June. He said a brokered <b> convention </b> wouldn't be the worst thing, but added, ``All things considered, it would be desirable if it didn't happen.'' Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey on Wednesday signaled the likelihood that he, too, would help in early selection of a nominee. First, he <b> told </b> party leaders in his home <b> state </b> that he would endorse a candidate before the <b> primary </b> there June 7, with Dukakis the favorite for his backing. And he said party leaders should halt an effort to put together an uncommitted delegate slate for the state. Victory for such a slate, he said, could cause problems for the front-running candidate when the <b> primary </b> is held. </p> 0.479709693591917  \n",
              "   Michael Dukakis, the clear Democratic front-runner after beating Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. in New York, said today the party's runner-up after the primaries won't necessarily be the <b> vice </b> <b> presidential </b> choice. Gore, conceding ``things didn't turn out exactly as I planned,'' suspended his <b> campaign </b> but said he would hang on to the <b> delegates </b> he's won so far. ``I want no part of a stop-Jackson or stop-Dukakis movement. The only man I want to stop is George Bush and we're going to stop George Bush, Gore said, bringing applause from supporters at a news conference in a Senate office building. ``Technically, I shall remain a candidate for the nomination but only to enable my <b> delegates </b> to go to the <b> convention </b> so they can represent our point of view in our party's deliberations,'' he said. Gore, the youngest candidate in the race, joked that in the campaign, ``I was doing great until I turned 40.'' Jackson, in Pennsylvania, brushed aside surveys suggesting he faces an uphill fight in next week's <b> primary </b> in that state. ``I do not follow opinion polls, I mold opinion,'' Jackson <b> told </b> cheering supporters in Philadelphia. Gore's decision to merely suspend his <b> campaign </b> followed a similar action by Sen. Paul Simon earlier. Both Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning today in Pennsylvania, where 178 Democratic <b> delegates </b> are at stake on Tuesday. Dukakis was going on to Ohio, which holds its <b> primary </b> a week later. Dukakis, asked about a potential <b> running </b> mate during an interview with The Associated Press, said, ``I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks as if it's pretty well in hand.'' Some Jackson backers were beginning to float the idea of Jackson as a possible <b> running </b> mate if Dukakis were the nominee. ``There would be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket,'' <b> campaign </b> chairman Willie Brown <b> told </b> The New York Times. But Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said such a ticket was unlikely. Kirk, in comments published in today's Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said, ``Only once in 19 elections since the turn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placed second and asked him to run. It was 1960.'' Dukakis himself said, ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn't entitle me to anything more than consideration, period.'' He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer questions about the <b> vice </b> presidency away from Jackson. ``The nominee makes that decision _ as he (Jackson) himself said. And rightly so,'' Dukakis said. On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush continued his march to the nomination, with 1,052 of the 1,139 <b> delegates </b> needed to nominate. Bush was endorsed Wednesday by California Gov. George Deukmejian, who had initially pledged neutrality through the June 7 California primary. But Bush's only remaining competitor is Pat Robertson, who has all but halted his campaign. Simon's suspension of his Democratic <b> presidential </b> <b> campaign </b> earlier this month drew fire from Jackson, who complained bitterly about the Illinois' senator's decision to keep a lock on <b> delegates </b> that would otherwise have gone to him. Jackson <b> campaign </b> spokesman Bob Brosage brushed aside talk of Jackson as <b> vice </b> president. ``We're still <b> running </b> for president,'' he said. ``There are significant primaries to come.'' And Jackson himself gave no indication he's giving up his drive for the nomination. ``We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,'' he <b> told </b> an enthusiastic crowd of 3,500 at a Philadelphia rally. Jackson was also picking up the endorsement today of the Philadelphia Daily News. A survey commissioned by the newspaper, in concert with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, suggested this week that Dukakis had a 3-1 lead in the state. Even so, ``Jesse Jackson can win,'' the Daily News said in an editorial. Financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission indicated Jackson had his best fund-raising month ever in March, raising $2.8 million. But Dukakis, whose <b> campaign </b> has been well bankrolled all along, raised $3.4 million during the same period. Jackson's stops in Pennsylvania today ranged from a high school to a labor rally to a homeless shelter. Dukakis was heading for Pittsburgh tonight, after spending a day in Boston following the New York primary. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, at a Democratic dinner in Washington Wednesday night, was eager to move beyond the raucous contest in his home state. ``I expect the <b> campaign </b> will be converted to an intelligent, civilized exchange of opinions,'' he said. Dukakis is comfortably ahead of Jackson in the delegate count, getting a boost Wednesday from the selection of congressional ``super delegates.'' The latest Associated Press delegate count gives Dukakis 1,063.15; Jackson 841.1; Gore 421.55; and uncommitted 613.75, out of 2,081 needed to nominate. But Dukakis was doing his best to dampen any talk of inevitability. When he was introduced at a Statehouse reception in Massachusetts as ``the next president of the United States,'' he grinned but quickly cautioned: ``Steady as she goes.'' In one respect, however, Dukakis was behaving as if he were the nominee, focusing attacks on Bush, who is all but certain to carry the GOP banner in the fall. ``I'm a doer,'' Dukakis said Wednesday, saying that characteristic stands in ``sharp contrast to the Republican nominee.'' </p> 0.451467600268355  \n",
              "   Democratic <b> presidential </b> contender Michael Dukakis said today at the White House that the Reagan administration's anti-terrorist policy is worthless because of arms dealing with Iran. In the Midwest Republican Bob Dole taunted George Bush for refusing to compete in Minnesota and South Dakota. Dukakis, speaking to reporters after a National Governors' Association meeting with the president, said, ``I'd have a much tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy.'' The Massachusetts governor, referring to the sale of arms to Iran during secret negotiations to free American hostages, said, ``We'll be living with the consequences of what happened in 1985 for a long time.'' ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless. And that's what we did,'' said Dukakis. Asked about Dukakis' statement, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I think it's very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you're talking about specific episodes. Vice President Bush, who has said repeatedly he supported Reagan's Iran initiative but was involved with few details, was campaigning in South Carolina today. But Dole, in Duluth, Minn., was suggesting Bush wasn't where he should have been. Minnesota and South Dakota, the next two events on the long road to the 1988 <b> presidential </b> nominations, vote on Tuesday. ``We're ready to do well here tomorrow. We're here to play,'' Dole <b> told </b> supporters in Duluth today. ``I don't know where George Bush is,'' Dole said. ``I didn't find him yesterday in Wyoming. Couldn't find him in South Dakota. Couldn't find him in Minnesota. Must be somewhere. And these are very important states. Later today we're going to send him a map of Minnesota so at least he gets a little idea where it is.'' Among the Democrats, Richard Gephardt, who also finished first in Iowa, is bidding for a strong showing in South Dakota's Democratic straw poll to give him a boost as the <b> campaign </b> moves toward the Super Tuesday showdown on March 8. The 4,067 Minnesota caucuses are the first step toward choosing 78 <b> delegates </b> to the Democratic National Convention, while on the Republican side caucus attendees will mark a non-binding straw ballot to express their <b> presidential </b> preference. In South Dakota's primary, Republican voters will determine allocation of 18 <b> convention </b> delegates, while the Democrats will hold a beauty contest ballot that will not have a binding effect on who gets the state's national <b> convention </b> delegates. Bush, faced with the potential of a repeat of the Iowa results in which Midwesterner Dole was a big winner, is concentrating on the South where he hopes to cripple the Kansas senator's effort. Dole is a strong favorite in South Dakota, while Minnesota is shaping up as a three-way fight between Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former television evangelist Pat Robertson. Dukakis, winner of the New Hampshire Democratic <b> presidential </b> primary, is campaigning hard in both these upper Midwest states in an effort to prove he can win <b> support </b> outside his native New England. After an appearance at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, including a session with President Reagan, Dukakis was flying to Minnesota to campaign. On his way into the White House for a black-tie dinner Sunday night, Dukakis quipped, ``I'm just looking the place over, that's all.'' Asked where he hoped to be next year, Dukakis replied, ``I hope right here.' Gephardt, who has made tough action to correct trade imbalances a cornerstone of his campaign, got a blow from his House colleagues when words came out they planned to scuttle his legislation that would impose sanctions on countries that maintain large trade surpluses with the United States through unfair practices. ``We're going to dump it because it's bad policy,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the Trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``I'm going to fight for my amendment,'' said Gephardt, when <b> told </b> of the plan. Much of the sniping between <b> presidential </b> rivals was being done by long distance. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who made little effort in Iowa and not much more in New Hampshire while pursuing a Southern strategy for the Democratic nomination, was interviewed on the NBC show ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday and got in jabs at both Dukakis and Gephardt. The senator attacked Gephardt for shifting positions. ``It's not a case of just having one or two or three issues where he has changed 180 degrees,'' said Gore. ``There is a long, long list of issues.'' Turning to Dukakis, Gore said the governor has not had ``a single day's experience in foreign policy.'' Dukakis' spokesman Leslie Dach quickly retorted that ``Al Gore's never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building an economy.'' Gephardt was attacking Dukakis in ads <b> running </b> in South Dakota that criticize the Massachusetts governor for not supporting farm legislation sponsored by Gephardt and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. The ads also take a shot at Dukakis for once suggesting in Iowa that farmers ought to consider diversifying into such crops as Belgian endive. The ads drew retorts from Dukakis supporters in both Minnesota and South Dakota. ``A new low in South Dakota <b> presidential </b> politics,'' said State Sen. Roger McKellips, a co-chairman of Dukakis' South Dakota campaign. After his surprising second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Robertson was considered a strong contender in Minnesota where caucus organization is once again important. The former evangelist was in Spartanburg, S.C., on Sunday and <b> told </b> a crowd of about 4,000 at a church dedication that ``the problem facing America is not a government problem but a moral problem.'' </p> </details> \n",

              "   Since the prison disturbances by Mariel Cuban detainees last fall, the government has released more than 1,000 of the detainees into halfway houses or with family sponsors in communities, the Justice Department announced Friday. One of the triggers to last year's uprisings at federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was the fact that the government was taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were deemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for the detainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble finding halfway house space for the detainees. From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in November, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released 106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A total of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances. INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots. Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the denials have been decided since the uprisings. When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detainees in various facilities. The Justice Department also announced it plans to repatriate 14 Mariel Cubans, the first group of detainees designated for return to Cuba since the prison disturbances. The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences for crimes committed in the United States, have been notified that the INS intends to send them back, the Justice Department said. Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of crimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape. The repatriation process will include a review of their cases by a Justice Department review panel under an agreement which ended the rioting at Atlanta and Oakdale. Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to submit additional information on their behalf to the Justice Department review panels, which specifically exclude <b> immigration </b> officers. </p> 0.376502286739609  \n",

In recent weeks, Ezell and other INS officials have taken pains to publicize the impending May 4 deadline to <b> apply </b> for amnesty. Romero-Gaitan, who was born in San Pedro, worked on a hacienda and as a rodeo rider, and operated a Guadalajara tortilla shop until his retirement at age 82 in 1968. When his wife died in 1974, his son Carlos Jr. of Watsonville, Calif., flew to Guadalajara and took him by plane to Tijuana, where they got into a waiting car. With the father asleep in the back, Carlos Jr. drove to the border. ``They (the Border Patrol) asked everyone else in the car for identification, but they didn't want to disturb the man who was asleep, so he got through clean,'' INS spokesman Joe Flanders said. Flanders said Romero-Gaitan has lived ever since in Watsonville, tending the family's garden, watching cowbody shows and boxing matches on television and venturing out to an annual rodeo in the Salinas area. Romero-Gaitan said Friday that he decided to <b> apply </b> for amnesty now ``so I can feel free to go out of my house and not be afraid of being picked up.'' Four of his five children are alive and live in the United States and Mexico. He has 30 grandchildren and 40 great-grandchildren. </p> 0.370149293726227  \n",
              "   The Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington will stop representing Cuban <b> diplomatic </b> interests in the United States by March, the state CTK news agency reported Tuesday. CTK quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the grace period should permit Havana ``to cope with the new situation, without jeopardizing its interests in the U.S.A.'' The Czechoslovak Embassy has represented Cuban interests in Washington since 1977. Diplomatic and consular ties between Cuba and the United States were severed in January 1961. Interests sections enable countries to maintain <b> diplomatic </b> contact without having to have full-fledged embassies. A senior Cuban <b> diplomatic </b> official in Washington, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the Cuban government has no alternate plan in mind at present to replace the current arrangement with the Czechoslovak government. He said he assumes both the Cuban and U.S. governments wish to maintain a <b> diplomatic </b> presence in each other's capital and that Cuba will seek a new arrangement. The official said he had seen news reports about Prague's decision but had heard nothing officially. U.S. <b> diplomatic </b> activities in Havana have been carried out under the auspices of the Swiss embassy. One <b> diplomatic </b> source suggested that Cuba may ask the Swiss to perform that function for Cuba in Washington. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry source as saying that ``the different opinions of the two countries on the exercising of human rights'' and other fundamental differences prompted the Czechoslovak decision. Czechoslovakia has become a democracy following the revolution that toppled the Communist leadership one year ago; Cuba remains Communist-ruled. The ministry source suggested that deteriorating relations after Czechoslovakia embraced democracy contributed to Prague's decision, CTK said. He singled out the storming of Czechoslovak <b> embassy </b> premises in Havana in July by Cubans who claimed they were dissidents but who the Czechoslovaks believe were in the pay of the Cuban government. The invasion of the <b> embassy </b> ``can be rightfully presumed to have been intended to discredit the new Czechoslovak regime in the eyes of the Cuban public,'' CTK quoted the source as saying. Efforts to contact the Czechoslovak <b> embassy </b> in Washington by telephone were unavailing. </p> 0.365187116447699  \n",
              "   At least 12 Mariel prisoners have apparently exhausted their administrative appeals and could be deported within days, but plans are in the works by prisoner advocates to block any deportations, a newspaper reported Thursday. Gary Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed by the Justice Department that there would be an announcement Thursday on the prisoners. Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in Miami and Atlanta plan to ask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried out would mark the first time Cubans have been deported to their <b> communist </b> homeland since May 1985, The Miami Herald reported. ``There is a chance if we all speak with one <b> united </b> voice here and explain the merits of our case,'' said Rafael Penalver, chairman of the Task Force of Cuban American Citizen Organizations. Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in Oakdale, La., and at an Atlanta prison last November. ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He can block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the airport.'' A special three-member Justice Department panel was created in the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Mariel detainees in federal prison in Talladega, Ala. In the past two months, the panel has looked at prison records, <b> immigration </b> history, written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but there have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers. Deportations to Cuba were reinstated as part of a renewed <b> immigration </b> pact between the United States and Cuba that allows up to 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families to emigrate and, in return, the Cuban government will take back 2,500 prisoners. The Justice Department contends that these prisoners are criminals the Cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from the port of Mariel. Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of Mariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984 <b> immigration </b> pact. Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, acknowledges there is much division over the deporations, even in Dade County's Cuban exile community. He said the foundation favors letting Cubans <b> apply </b> for visas to immigrate to the United States but opposes the deportations to Cuba. ``I cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation in Cuba and then support sending them back,'' Mas said. </p> 0.363299074150423  \n",
              "   An attorney for 13 Cuban detainees argued Tuesday they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylum before being sent back to the homeland they fled in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Lee Ochoa of Miami, an attorney for 13 of 15 Cubans convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, told U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon that some of the Cubans were afraid to go home because they did not know how they would be treated by Fidel Castro's government. Clemon said he will rule Monday on whether to allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to fly the 13 back to Cuba. Clemon said he wanted to give attorneys for the Cubans time to support their request for a preliminary order blocking the deportation. The INS on Nov. 17 notified 15 Cubans at at the Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega that they would be deported within 72 hours. However, the next day the government promised Clemon it would not send them home until their attorneys had a chance to study their files. Leo Ochoa of Miami, attorney for 13 of the 15, told Clemon that they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym and to due process. ``In this country we want to do things fairly and properly,'' Ochoa said. But Lauri Fillppu of the INS said that the Cubans' only claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in Cuba. He said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court in Atlanta already had rejected that argument. Fillppu questioned what he called ``a last-minute tactic'' by the Cubans, claiming there was no new evidence. </p> </details> \n",

              "   It was ``an act of God'' that brought two love-struck bulls together with the <b> cows </b> next door, says a man accused of negligence for failing to keep them apart. The bulls were unexpectedly freed from their pen when a tree limb felled by a storm crushed the fence enclosing them. They headed for Maggie and Blackbird, two pure-bred <b> cows </b> awaiting artificial insemination by a $770,000, prize-winning Angus bull named Broadway. Since the bulls, aged 9 and 13 months, may have beaten Broadway's time with the cows, the cows' owners were advised to wait 60 to 90 days before artificial insemination, to make sure Broadway was the father. Though this was done, the owners are suing Kirk Hardin, caretaker of the bulls and cows, for $39,000, accusing him of negligence in not keeping the guys and gals apart. Lonnie Pembrook, owner of Pembrook Cattle Co. near Fairview, and Tom Young, a New Jersey businessman, each owned a half-interest in Blackbird. Pembrook owns Maggie. Hardin, a specialist in artificial insemination and embryo transfer techniques, contends the fence mishap, in the fall of 1986, was an ``act of God'' that could not have been prevented or foreseen. The trial began Monday before a Payne County jury, and testimony ended Tuesday. Closing arguments are scheduled Friday. After the artificial insemination took place, the embryos were frozen, according to testimony. Pembrook picked up the frozen embryos in October, but there was no testimony on whether the embryos had since been placed in host cows. </p> 0.394664977062178  \n",
              "   Elizabeth Taylor ignored her ex-boyfriend in court Wednesday as their lawyers began selecting a jury to decide a multimillion-dollar dispute over the rights to her ``Passion'' perfume. Miss Taylor walked across the courtroom surrounded by her lawyers and made no acknowledgement of former beau Henry Wynberg, seated at the opposite end of a table. A panel of 50 prospective jurors sat with their eyes riveted on the actress, dressed in purple, as the judge explained what the trial was all about. Miss Taylor won permission earlier in the day to tell jurors about Wynberg's criminal record after her lawyers said it would explain her decision to keep him out of her perfume business. Lawyers for Henry Wynberg sought to prevent jurors from hearing that Wynberg - who courted Miss Taylor between her two marriages to Richard Burton - once pleaded guilty to statutory rape, providing drugs to underage high school girls in return for sex and taking pornographic photos of young girls. They called the evidence ``irrelevant, inflammatory and prejudicial.'' But Miss Taylor's lawyers argued that those issues were crucial to proving that she was justified in breaking off her business relationship with Wynberg ``because any reputable cosmetics company would refuse to deal with Wynberg.'' Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart declined to bar the evidence. Wynberg claims he conceived the actress' line of ``Passion'' perfume, and he's seeking a hefty share of the profits. He says he created the fragrance under the Elizabeth Taylor Cosmetics Inc. banner. At stake: about $70 million a year in profits. Litigation has produced volumes of depositions and affidavits about Wynberg's claim that he had a contract with Miss Taylor for exclusive rights to her name and likeness for promotion and sale of cosmetics. Wynberg sued in 1986 for 72 percent of ``Passion'' profits. Court documents show Wynberg's two-year romance with the violet-eyed actress ended in August 1975, when Miss Taylor said, ``I'm going back to Richard, Henry. I'll see you later.'' Burton and Miss Taylor remarried in Africa, and Wynberg returned to California. Court records show that a short time later, Miss Taylor and Wynberg signed the cosmetics agreement in Switzerland, with Burton as a witness. Wynberg said he spent years consulting with chemists and manufacturers, smelling perfumes and looking for the perfect bottle. ``I wanted sparkling little lights like stars in there, and I wanted it to look like money, feel like money,'' Wynberg said. According to Wynberg, Hen he presented the actress with the heart-shaped bottle and fragrance in November 1983, Miss Taylor said: ``Let's let bygones be bygones, Henry. Let's split 50-50 on the perfume deal.'' In a deposition, Miss Taylor denies Wynberg's assertion. ``I didn't want to do any business with him,'' she said. Miss Taylor contends that Wynberg's failure to follow through on the project violated the contract and made it invalid. In 1986 she signed with the Chesebrough-Ponds Inc. cosmetics company to market ``Passion'' using her name and likeness. It went on to be a big seller. </p> 0.346147855963656  \n",

Operating revenue in the hotel sector declined 12 <b> percent </b> to $21 million. The drop was largely due to a one-time credit that boosted revenue in the 1987 <b> quarter </b> and a charge for taxes that depressed the figure for the latest quarter, said Roy Judge, a vice president and assistant to the chairman.

But second-quarter revenue for the nation's biggest automaker rose 12 <b> percent </b> to $29.9 <b> billion </b> from $26.7 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> ago, breaking the previous quarterly record of $27.6 <b> billion </b> set in 1986 when the auto <b> industry </b> set a 16.3 million-vehicle annual <b> sales </b> record. GM <b> reported </b> net <b> earnings </b> of $1.5 billion, or $4.52 a common share, up from $1.17 billion, or $3.39 a common share, in the second <b> quarter </b> a <b> year </b> ago. ``It was a good quarter. The number of units produced per employee went up almost 17 <b> percent </b> versus second-quarter last year. That's phenomenally good, showing the kind of <b> earnings </b> General Motors can have if <b> sales </b> pick up,'' said Ronald Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco. Car and light truck <b> sales </b> in 1988 have continued to surge well ahead of pessimistic predictions issued in the wake of the October 1987 stock <b> market </b> crisis. Expectations for the <b> year </b> have risen to a consensus of about 15.6 <b> million </b> vehicles, and GM has benefited from the industry's surprisingly strong performance. ``Last year, (sales) volume was so low that most of their gains came from accounting changes. This year, it seems based on volume. Sales were strong in the first half, particularly in the second quarter,'' said Kathleen Heaney, analyst with Nikko Securities International in New York. Second-quarter revenue rose 12 <b> percent </b> from a <b> year </b> ago and broke the previous GM record for any <b> quarter </b> of $27.6 <b> billion </b> set in 1986, GM said. The <b> earnings </b> were the best for any <b> quarter </b> since second <b> quarter </b> 1984. GM also said that as of June 30, it had shaved $2.7 <b> billion </b> of the $4 <b> billion </b> it plans to trim from its costs during 1988. In the second quarter, operating income rose 64 percent, to $1.75 <b> billion </b> from $1.07 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> earlier. It rose 16 <b> percent </b> in the first six months, to $2.4 <b> billion </b> from $2.08 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> ago. GM said the improvement came both from a return to stronger profitability in North America and overseas performance stronger than last year's record. However, GM said it does not provide income for different geographic areas on a quarterly basis. GM's worldwide vehicle <b> sales </b> rose 9.3 <b> percent </b> in the second quarter, to 2.25 million. At the end of the second quarter, GM's North American-built cars and light trucks held 35.1 <b> percent </b> of the U.S. market, up slightly from 33.8 <b> percent </b> at the end of June 1987. In the first six months of 1988, GM <b> earnings </b> rose 13.3 <b> percent </b> to $2.6 billion, or $7.63 a share, on revenue of $56.34 <b> billion </b> from $2.29 billion, or $6.65 a share, on revenue of $52.8 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> ago. On Wednesday, GM <b> reported </b> <b> earnings </b> by its three subsidiaries _ General Motors Acceptance Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp., and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. GM blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings for an 18.9 <b> percent </b> drop in GMAC earnings. Second-quarter <b> earnings </b> for EDS and Hughes were up 33 <b> percent </b> and 16.4 percent, respectively. </p> </details> \n",

              "   The number of white <b> blood </b> cells infected by the AIDS <b> virus </b> rises sharply in the year before virus-infected males actually develop the disease, says a <b> study </b> that may lead to speedier <b> treatment </b> for AIDS victims. While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is trying to develop a simpler test that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown AIDS, said the CDC's Janet Nicholson. Such a test would help <b> doctors </b> decide when the benefits of giving <b> patients </b> certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks, said Dr. Paul Volberding, associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and AIDS program director at San Francisco General Hospital. ``If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point, even if he hadn't developed full-blown AIDS,'' he said. Nicholson, the CDC's clinical immunology chief, presented her findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing <b> blood </b> cells from 15 homosexual Atlanta men who were infected by the <b> virus </b> and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didn't suffer AIDS. Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, Nicholson said. She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected peripheral <b> blood </b> mononuclear cells _ a class of white <b> blood </b> cells. If a simple test could show that someone infected with the <b> virus </b> soon will get AIDS, <b> doctors </b> could better decide when to prescribe AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections that kill AIDS <b> patients </b> once the <b> virus </b> has crippled their <b> immune </b> systems, Volberding said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is believed to slow progression of AIDS. From a scientific standpoint, ``learning what a person's risk of developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,'' he said. But Nicholson and Volberding acknowledged that some AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will develop <b> disease </b> symptoms. Nicholson said <b> researchers </b> previously knew that people infected with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting white <b> blood </b> cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection progresses. Her <b> study </b> found that the number of helper cells decreases more quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in infected <b> patients </b> who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms. ``It's not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will develop disease,'' she said, adding that her findings point the way toward determining which <b> patients </b> are likely to do so. AIDS, or acquired <b> immune </b> deficiency syndrome is caused by a <b> virus </b> that damages the body's <b> immune </b> system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. The CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991. </p> 0.654384948653109  \n",
              "   The Red Cross acknowledged Saturday it erred in distributing 24 pints of <b> blood </b> that had failed AIDS procedures but said none of the <b> blood </b> was used and none carried the deadly virus. The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the questionable one-pint units were shipped last month to hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers in Washington and Nashville, Tenn., but were never used on any patients. The FDA did not identify the facilities that received the blood. ``While it should not have been shipped, it actually proved to be HIV (AIDS virus) free, and a number of units underwent processing that would inactivate the virus,'' said Gene Jeffers, American Red Cross spokesman. He said there was ``no known <b> health </b> hazard associated with the 24 units of blood. We were very fortunate and lucked out in that there was no human risk at all involved here.'' Jeffers acknowledged, however, that five of the units tested positive for hepatitis B antigens and could have posed a <b> health </b> risk had they been used in transfusions. However, they were not used, he said. Initial tests showed 10 of the questionable units contained HIV antibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those units underwent a process that breaks down the <b> blood </b> into components for specific uses and eliminates the virus, Jeffers said. The remaining nine units, he said, were from donors who were unacceptable because they previously tested ``false positive'' for AIDS, but all the actual units were tested as safe, he said. Federal officials estimate that the chances of getting AIDS, or acquired <b> immune </b> deficiency syndrome, from a transfusion are one in 40,000. The chief victims have been homosexual men or intravenous <b> drug </b> users. No one is known to have recovered from the <b> disease </b> that attacks the body's <b> immune </b> system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The Nashville Banner reported Saturday that two additional pints from disqualified donors were actually used in transfusions, but no patient was harmed. The newspaper gave no details of the transfusions but said follow-up tests of the <b> blood </b> donors showed they did not carry the AIDS virus. Jeffers said he knew of no actual transfusion of <b> blood </b> that should have been rejected. The FDA report said none of the questionable <b> blood </b> was used on patients. As a result of the errors, the FDA said it has increased its periodic audits of the <b> blood </b> supply and instituted new training procedures for <b> blood </b> bank employees. The mistake in Washington was discovered in a routine audit. The Tennessee errors came to light in an FDA investigation that followed a lawsuit against local <b> blood </b> bank officials by a woman who said she became infected with AIDS through a <b> blood </b> transfusion. Two senior officials of the Washington regional office of the American Red Cross _ John McGraw and Frederick Darr _ have been suspended with pay for 30 days pending an investigation of their actions, said Richard Schubert, president of the American Red Cross. Schubert said no officials in the Nashville <b> center </b> had been disciplined, but that the investigation there was continuing. Six of the questionable units of <b> blood </b> were from the Washington <b> center </b> and the other 18 were from Nashville, the FDA said. </p> 0.644204546928449  \n",
              "   The Centers for Disease Control disputes a <b> study </b> by the Hudson Institute that the number of Americans infected with the deadly AIDS <b> virus </b> is actually twice the official estimate. In a <b> study </b> released Friday, the Hudson Institute said that up to 3 million Americans are infected by the AIDS virus, an estimate that is far above the calculation by CDC, the primary federal agency monitoring the spread of AIDS. Kevin R. Hopkins, a Hudson mathematician, said his <b> study </b> uses ``realistic'' assumptions not used by the CDC and, as a result, his estimate is closer to the true number of Americans infected by the human immunodeficiency <b> virus </b> which causes AIDS. ``The actual number of people carrying the HIV <b> virus </b> in the United States (at the end of 1987) was not the 900,000 to 1.4 million the official sources estimate, but probably more than twice that number,'' the Hudson report said. ``There were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the AIDS virus, with the most likely total of infections probably close to 2.4 million,'' the report said. Dr. Timothy Dondero, chief of a CDC branch studying the spread of AIDS, quickly disputed the claim, however. In a telephone interview from the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Dondero said he and his staff reviewed the Hudson <b> study </b> and the methods used and said, ``We do not feel a change in our data is appropriate.'' He said that for the Hudson model to be correct, about 2 percent of the young adult population in the United States would have to be infected with HIV. Yet, he said, ``their figures are inconsistently high within segments of populations for which there are test results.'' Dondero said tests from hospital patients, military recruits and prisoners show HIV infection rates of less than 1 percent _ 0.2 percent to 0.66 percent _ among young adults. Hopkins admitted, ``We're all in a guessing game'' when it comes to estimating the number of people infected with the AIDS virus. Nonetheless, he said he believed the Hudson method is a more realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation. ``The CDC may be right and we may be wrong,'' Hopkins said. ``Until a national seroprevalence test is conducted, we will not know. ... The main conclusion is that we cannot be complacent about this disease.'' The <b> study </b> by Hudson, a privately financed public policy <b> research </b> organization with headquarters in Indianapolis, used basic CDC data on the number of AIDS cases. But Hopkins said Hudson used different computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques to estimate the rate of HIV infections. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is caused by the HIV virus, is the end stage of the <b> disease </b> and may not develop for years after a person is infected with the virus. But an infected person can spread the <b> virus </b> before developing AIDS. For this reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic. HIV infection is determined by a <b> blood </b> test which identifies antibodies in <b> blood </b> serum. A person with such antibodies is known as seropositive. Hopkins said the Hudson <b> study </b> also estimated that the number of heterosexuals infected by the <b> virus </b> may be three times higher than CDC estimates. The CDC says the chief victims of AIDS, a contagious <b> disease </b> that attacks the body's <b> immune </b> system, have been homosexual men and intravenous <b> drug </b> users. The Hudson <b> study </b> estimates that of the 850,000 to 1.4 million heterosexuals infected with the HIV virus, between 200,000 and 500,000 are those who do not use drugs. ``There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,'' said Hopkins. ``A breakout into the non-monogamous population is unavoidable.'' The CDC has estimated that the AIDS <b> virus </b> has infected only 80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population. The Hudson report said about 118,000 of the heterosexuals infected are ``mainstream'' population members. ``They are not poor, and they are not IV <b> drug </b> users,'' Hudson said. ``But they are nonetheless carriers of the <b> virus </b> and, through their sexual contacts, can proceed to spread the <b> disease </b> to others of their same class.'' The CDC says that as of Aug. 15, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,702 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,898, have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. </p> 0.621781836027599  \n",
              "   Mice prone to developing a <b> blood </b> cell <b> cancer </b> gained partial protection from a human gene that influences <b> blood </b> cell development, suggesting that developmental genes may affect vulnerability to cancer, <b> researchers </b> say. Such genes may make a difference in how long normal cells remain susceptible to turning malignant, they said. The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature by Philip Leder, Michel Nussenzweig and Emmett Schmidt of Harvard Medical School with colleagues there and at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. They worked with mice that carried a human c-myc gene, which puts them at high risk for developing a <b> blood </b> cell <b> cancer </b> called pre-B cell lymphoma. Pre-B cells are those that will develop as B cells, an important part of the body's disease-fighting <b> immune </b> system. Those mice were bred with others that carried a different human gene, one that makes B cells skip an early stage in their development. Some progeny from these matings inherited both human genes, and their lymphoma rates were compared to those that carried only the cancer-causing gene. Results showed that the gene that speeds development caused both a delay and a reduction in the tumors, <b> researchers </b> said. By 117 days of age, half the mice that carried only the cancer-causing gene had developed lymphoma, but none of the mice with both genes had developed it. After a year, more than 90 percent of the first group had developed tumors, compared to only 40 percent of the mice with both human genes. The developmental gene apparently hampered development of <b> cancer </b> by speeding up the maturation of pre-B cells, leaving fewer at stages most susceptible to the cancer-causing gene, <b> researchers </b> suggested. In general, a diverse group of genes that produce either an acceleration or pause in cell development may influence the rates and time of onset for cancer, <b> researchers </b> said. </p> 0.615171713382808  \n",
              "   A panel of experts says removing a cancerous tumor in the early stages of breast <b> cancer </b> gives as good a survival chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast is removed. Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give ``excellent'' results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the panel said. The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the National Institutes of Health to consider <b> research </b> on the survival of women with early stages of breast <b> cancer </b> and to develop a consensus on what therapy should be used to treat the disease. ``The therapies appear to be equivalent in survival,'' said Dr. William C. Wood, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and chairman of the committee. ``We believe it is preferable to preserve an organ.'' Mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early stage breast cancer, Wood said. A lumpectomy is followed with radiation therapy, and Wood said some <b> patients </b> choose mastectomy because they ``prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of radiation therapy.'' In its report, the committee said surgery in which the breast is saved, or conserved, ``is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer, and is preferable'' because the breast is preserved and the survival chances are the same as for mastectomy. Wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the removal of nearby lymph nodes. If these nodes are cancer-free and the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter, both methods of <b> treatment </b> have about a 90 percent chance of cure. About 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast <b> cancer </b> this year, the committee report said. Between 75 percent and 80 percent of this group will have Stage I or Stage II disease, and about two-thirds of these will have cancer-free lymph nodes. Stage I and II cancers have not spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes. But just how to treat this early-stage breast <b> cancer </b> long has been controversial. Traditionally, the preferred <b> treatment </b> has been a radical mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is removed. During the past two decades, there have been a number of studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast surgery, including lumpectomy. The committee found that, based on the studies, survival rates are virtually the same for the two types of therapy. The experts said the picture was less clear for follow-up <b> treatment </b> using chemotherapy or a <b> drug </b> that blocks the hormone estrogen. The studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy, but the committee said the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patient's quality of life. For <b> patients </b> with very small primary tumors _ one centimeter or less _ adjuvant therapy is not required, the committee said. The committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full understanding by the patient of all the options. Lumpectomies are not appropriate for all Stage I or II <b> patients </b> because of the size of the breast, or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps within the breast, the committee said. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Marion Barry's lawyer is portraying Rasheeda Moore as a vengeful ex-lover who trapped the <b> mayor </b> in an FBI sting operation because he had abandoned her for another woman. Moore, a former model, denied the suggestion Friday at the mayor's cocaine and perjury trial, insisting, ``I was not out to get Mr. Barry.'' But she acknowledged that she had repeatedly steered the conversation around to drugs during the secretly videotaped encounter with Barry in a Washington hotel room last Jan. 18. She conceded that Barry was primarily interested that evening in having sex with her. In her second day of cross-examination by Barry's chief lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, Moore also acknowledged that she broke the FBI's instructions and tried to persuade the <b> mayor </b> to use drugs. Midway through the FBI videotape in which Barry ultimately smoked crack cocaine, Moore asked the <b> mayor </b> if he wants to use drugs. ``No, not tonight,'' Barry replied in the tape, which was played in court Thursday. ``You felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade, influence, coerce or beguile'' Barry into using drugs, Mundy asked Moore. ``I did,'' she replied. ``Why did you do that?'' the lawyer asked. ``Just in the gist of the evening,'' said Moore, who said she got ``overcarried'' in performing her duties for the FBI. ``In your zeal to get Mr. Barry,'' Mundy said accusingly. ``For all you knew, he had been off drugs since May'' 1989 when Moore moved to California. ``Not in my zeal,'' the witness insisted. ``I was not out to get Mr. Barry.'' ``What was your intent?'' Mundy asked Moore. ``Working this operation'' with the FBI, she replied. The defense lawyer suggested that Moore had been badly treated by the <b> mayor </b> and motivated by revenge. ``Were you mad at Mr. Barry because he didn't return your calls'' throughout an eight-month span in 1989, Mundy asked. ``No, I wasn't,'' Moore replied. She also denied that she was angry because the married <b> mayor </b> was involved with another woman, Maria McCarthy, or because he had slapped her when they broke up their romantic relationship. Had Moore been scorned? a reporter asked Mundy after the day's court session. ``A woman scorned,'' Mundy agreed immediately. ``Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.'' McCarthy was jailed for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury looking into the mayor's alleged drug use. She later relented and is now listed as a possible witness at Barry's trial. Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. One of the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation. Meanwhile Friday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, presiding in the Barry case, barred <b> black </b> activist clergyman George Augustus Stallings, a Barry supporter, from attending the trial. Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest, broke with the Vatican by starting his own African-American church. Mundy and the American Civil Liberties Union said they were asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn Jackson's decision regarding Stallings as well as his order Thursday barring Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Jackson said Stallings' and Farrakhan's presence in the courtroom would be potentially disruptive. Barry told reporters he could ``not understand why any citizen'' who wanted to use one of the four courtroom passes provided to the defense cannot do so. ``So I think that we are in a totalitarian situation where Bishop Stallings or Minister Farrakhan (cannot attend.),'' Barry said. ``It's like in Nazi Germany.'' </p> 0.364913244447588  \n",
              "   Beneath a naked bluff on a mile-long Boston Harbor island known chiefly for its antiquated jail lie the unmarked graves of about 4,100 early immigrants whose American dreams ended in death. Most were famine-weakened Irish who fled their starving country in the mid-1800s only to be deemed ``undesirable'' and detained on Deer Island, where they died and until now were largely forgotten. ``They symbolize all immigrants that have come to Boston and to America,'' Mayor Raymond Flynn said this week. ``They may have been poor, probably didn't have any family and weren't among the elite. ``But still every respect should be afforded to their memory.'' Residents of Boston, home to more Irish-Americans per capita than any other U.S. city, are resurrecting the <b> city's </b> missing chapter. Deer Island's low-security jail is scheduled to close in 1991 and local business, labor and other groups plan to have the gravesite landscaped by 1995, the 150th anniversary year of the potato famine. The <b> mayor </b> has announced plans to erect a Celtic cross on the island and a statue near Fanueil Hall as part of the <b> city's </b> ``Great Hunger Memorial Project,'' the nation's first <b> memorial </b> to Irish famine victims _ and victims of hunger around the world. The graves on the island about four miles from Boston's wharves came to Flynn's attention several months ago, after construction workers turned up bones at a new sewage treatment plant site. ``You think of them getting this far, coming across the Atlantic and being able to look over and see the <b> city </b> ... only to end up in an anonymous pauper's grave,'' said Francis J. Costello, the mayor's adviser on Irish-American Affairs. ``We have to put a proper finish on this.'' Many of the thousands of immigrants held on Deer Island eventually made it to a new life on the mainland. But thousands more were buried in shallow, lime-lined trenches that held eight or 10 bodies each. Their anonymous graves tell the story of immigrants who saw but never reached America's shores. Ireland's population of 8 million was cut in half by fatal disease, starvation and emigration after a devastating plant disease hit the country's staple potato crop in 1845. During the next 10 years, more than 152,000 Irish fled to Boston, many of them tenant farmers forced to move on when they no longer could afford to pay rent. The Yankees were unprepared for the influx of penniless, weak and diseased immigrants, many of whom were near death after a month or more aboard the crowded ``coffin ships'' they had taken across the Atlantic. ``As a precautionary measure to ward off a pestilence that would have been ruinous to the public health and business of the city,'' a quarantine hospital was established on Deer Island, according to a Massachusetts Senate document dated 1848. Paupers and inmates also were held on the island because officials deemed them, like the Irish and a fraction of immigrants from other countries, ``undesirable within the core urban area,'' according to <b> city </b> documents. ``It was really a human dump heap,'' said Dennis P. Ryan, author of ``Beyond The Ballot: A Social History of the Boston Irish.'' Several rough-hewn wooden crosses stood for years on the bluff near the graves, but by about 1970 they had disappeared or disintegrated. A lone <b> white </b> Celtic cross also was erected amid the yellow rapeseed, but that too is gone. ``It wasn't a deep dark secret,'' said Deborah Cox, president of the Public Archaeology Laboratory Inc. in Pawtucket, R.I. ``I think it was just one of those things people don't pay attention to and then eventually forget,'' said Cox, whose company surveyed Deer Island before construction began on the new sewage treatment plant in late 1988. Boston's archivist, Edward Quill, has begun researching death records and handwritten weekly logs kept by physicians at Deer Island's quarantine hospital. For years the records have gathered dust, now they'll be available to genealogists and other researchers. Several Flynns have turned up among the 872 names Quill has traced. ``It could well have been any immigrant group that has come to our country,'' said Mayor Flynn. ``That's why we need a symbol, a decent resting place ... so their history won't be forgotten.'' </p> 0.352500052649356  \n",
              "   The cocaine and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry has focused attention on race relations in the nation's capital, a <b> city </b> with a 70 percent <b> black </b> population and little recent history of <b> racial </b> strife. ``I think that there is a perception with a substantial number of the population that he is being picked on unfairly,'' said Kenneth Robinson, a local attorney who consulted with Barry's counsel. Robinson is white. ``I think the Barry trial is just another indication that people are very, very sensitive to race and how people are treated,'' said Ethelbert Miller, a poet who teaches at Howard University. Miller is black. A U.S. District Court jury began deliberating the Barry case Thursday afternoon. Two members, both men, are white. One of them has been chosen jury foreman. Barry admits that the trial has brought to the surface ``a simmering amount of polarization and racism that was already there.'' Some <b> blacks </b> agree with Barry's claim that he was the target of overzealous <b> white </b> prosecutors. Others feel betrayed by the mayor, who had claimed repeatedly that he didn't use drugs. ``The majority of <b> whites </b> are just plain annoyed and angry and just want this guy to go,'' D.C. Councilman Jim Nathanson said before the trial began. Nathanson, who is white, represents a predominantly <b> white </b> district. For all the talk about <b> racial </b> polarization, Barry is the one who was often credited with cooling the tempers that erupted after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Ten people died, 1,191 were reported injured and 7,650 were arrested in the <b> city's </b> worst riots. Washington was then 63 percent black. Some <b> black </b> leaders, Jesse L. Jackson among them, have suggested that the climate exists for a resurgence of <b> racial </b> violence in Washington if Barry is convicted. Barry himself said it will not. ``Those who would even talk about that don't represent me, don't represent what I stand for,'' he told reporters last week. ``You obviously don't realize that we have grown as a people the last 20 years. We will not destroy that which we have worked so hard to build up.'' ``To equate this to the violence that would occur when a <b> white </b> man killed Martin Luther King is asinine,'' Robinson said. ``People will talk about it in bars and on the street, but I just don't believe that it is going to happen.'' ``Some of the noise that you hear is sort of par for the course,'' said Sam Smith, the <b> white </b> publisher of the Progressive Review, a Washington opinion journal. ``It's just that more people are paying attention to it now.'' The presiding judge in the trial, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is white. One of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin, is white. The other, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts, is black. Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, is black. Barry has called the case ``a political lynching'' and a case of ``satanic, dirt-like tactics.'' Jackson called it part of an ``ugly pattern'' of ``white judicial leadership attacking <b> black </b> political leadership.'' NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks voiced a similar complaint. U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said he believes in trying cases ``regardless of who the person is or what the political priorities are.'' The <b> mayor </b> and his allies have also sharply criticized news media coverage of the case. Abdul Alim Muhammad, a Muslim who is running for Congress in suburban Prince George's County, Md., said, ``What we are witnessing in D.C. is like an electronic lynching. In some respects, the media are no better than the red-necked tobacco chewing <b> members </b> of the Ku Klux Klan.'' Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, has shown his support for Barry by attending the trial despite efforts by the judge to have him barred as ``potentially disruptive.'' Barry, who broke into politics as a street organizer in the <b> civil </b> <b> rights </b> movement, has been <b> mayor </b> for 12 years. He is not seeking re-election, and six candidates are running to succeed him. When one of them, City Council Chairman David Clarke, was introduced at a rally for <b> black </b> South African leader Nelson Mandela, he was booed by <b> members </b> of the mostly <b> black </b> audience. Clarke is white. Although he still has a loyal following, especially among poor blacks, Barry is increasingly viewed as an embarrassment by <b> members </b> of Washington's large <b> black </b> middle class. Long-time <b> civil </b> <b> rights </b> advocate and educator Roger Wilkins, a past political supporter of the mayor, wrote recently in The Washington Post: ``Marion Barry used the elders and lied to the young. He has manipulated thousands of others with his cynical use of charges of racism to defend his malodorous personal failures.'' Robert Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, said Barry ``has certainly created a <b> racial </b> situation out of something that I do not think was. He is exploiting tensions and in some cases creating tensions that otherwise would not have existed.'' Woodson, who is black, was a member of a White House <b> council </b> on private sector initiatives in the Reagan administration. The Rev. James Bevel, a Barry supporter who conducted prayer meetings in a tent outside the courthouse through much of the trial, said; ``It is not affecting basic race relationships or hostilities in <b> black </b> folks toward <b> white </b> people. I don't see that in the people I'm around.'' The Rev. A. Knighton Stanley, the <b> black </b> pastor of People's Congregational Church, said he avoids raising the issue of possible violence. ``Am I uneasy? My answer is yes,'' said Stanley. ``My judgment is we will not have it, and my prayer is that my judgment is right.'' </p> 0.325951367562285  \n",
              "   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he stands by his criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson before New York's Democratic primary, but says he regrets that his belligerent style and sharply worded attacks offended Jackson's supporters. In a statement released hours after Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called on the <b> mayor </b> to apologize for his ``divisive'' remarks, Koch said he had ``articulated my concerns in a way that, regrettably, offended a large number of people, both <b> black </b> and white.'' ``I would hope they will look beyond my style to the substance of what I said, which I believe was fair political criticism. ``The words I used were too sharp. These are words I have used for years. Because of the particular sensitivity of this situation, I should have been more careful in my choice of words.'' It was highly unusual for Ward _ the <b> city's </b> first <b> black </b> police commissioner and a Koch appointee _ to comment on political matters that did not directly involve the police department, but he said he felt the need to do so because he was being asked regularly about Koch's anti-Jackson efforts. In a letter that appeared in today's editions of The New York Times, Koch said, ``It was never my intent to draw political lines with <b> racial </b> or religious borders.'' Ward said today he was ``absolutely'' satisfied that the <b> mayor </b> never intended to insult the <b> black </b> community. Koch's attacks on Jackson have brought a continued backlash and have prompted early efforts to form a coalition to defeat the <b> mayor </b> next year, when it is expected he will seek a fourth term. When asked if Koch was apologizing to Jackson as well as his supporters, the mayor's press secretary, George Arzt, responded: ``Whatever the letter says. We're not going beyond it.'' </p> 0.319054610538338  \n",
              "   Big Bird was there, and Fozzie Bear, and Oscar the Grouch, as more than 1,400 colleagues, family and fans paid tribute to Muppet creator Jim Henson in a verdant St. Paul's Cathedral. England was a second home to Henson, who died in May at the age of 53. ``He loved England and the English; we claim him as ours,'' said Duncan Kenworthy, chief of Henson Productions in Britain. For the tribute, the cathedral was transformed to resemble a north London parkland Henson loved. The 17th-century building was festooned with greenery, its aisles full of Henson's creatures and portraits of their creator. Friends and colleagues of Henson had worked into the night adorning the cathedral with garlands, plants and birches. A May 21 <b> memorial </b> for Henson at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York included a Dixieland band and Muppets singing their way through the crowd. Henson died May 16 in New York of pneumonia. Henson's family asked well-wishers not to wear black, saying the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for Henson's life as a traditional <b> memorial </b> service. ``He has left a heritage that will never be forgotten. Jim Henson will always be with us,'' said Lord Lew Grade. It was Grade who contracted Henson in 1976 to make 24 half-hour episodes of ``The Muppet Show'' after the Muppeteer failed to find American backing for the variety show. The show became one of the most widely seen television programs in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100 countries. Most of Henson's films were made in Britain as well. Henson owned a home in north London's leafy Hampstead district, across the street from the onetime Victorian post office housing the Creature Shop where his puppets are made. Muppet performer Richard Hunt led a quartet in a medley of Henson's favorite songs. Henson's wife Jane and four of his five children attended. ```When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who makes a difference in this world,''' daughter Cheryl, 29, recited from an essay written by her father. ```My hope still is to leave this world a little bit better than it was when I got here.''' ``We really feel he did leave the world a bit better,'' she told the congregation. ``So, thanks.'' </p> </details> \n",

              "   After 10 months, one of the many unanswered questions in the <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> of Attorney General Edwin Meese III is whether he benefited financially from his efforts on behalf of an Iraqi oil <b> pipeline </b> project or scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., <b> sources </b> familiar with the probe say. Last May 11, <b> independent </b> counsel James McKay launched his inquiry of Meese's assistance to Wedtech and the probe has spread to the <b> attorney </b> general's involvement with the pipeline. In both instances, McKay's investigators have been examining stock trades made on Meese's behalf by his investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn. Chinn and Meese were brought together by Meese's longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, a central figure in both the Wedtech scandal and the <b> pipeline </b> project. It was disclosed earlier this month that: _In connection with the $1 billion proposed pipeline, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport paid $150,000 to his <b> attorney </b> Wallach, who directed the funds to an account owned by Chinn. Rappaport was a partner in the project with San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc., which was going to build the pipeline. Rappaport was brought into the deal in 1985 primarily because of his close ties to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. _The money from the Meese Partners account, Wallach's $150,000 placed in the Chinn account and several hundred thousand dollars from Chinn's biggest customer, Marymount College of Palos Verdes, Calif., were used as capital by Chinn to buy hard-to-get, brand-new stock issues, which Chinn sold later the same day. It would have been difficult for Chinn to obtain such stock with Meese's money alone. ``Without using the holdings of the other accounts he controlled, ... Mr. Chinn may not have been able to conduct the number of trades he did ... on behalf of Meese Partners,'' a congressional subcommittee said in a report this month. _Once the stock was sold and the profit and loss determined, Chinn assigned profits and losses to his various customers. Overall, Meese invested $50,000 and came away 18 months later with $95,000, almost all of it gained through a total of 23 one-day stock trades. Eighteen of the trades were profitable. In seven of the trades, the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> didn't have enough money in his account to generate the profits and losses that were assigned him. Chinn's biggest customer, Marymount College, didn't fare nearly as well as Meese. Was the stock trading actually a well-disguised payoff to Meese? That question is one that McKay's office has been unable to resolve, say the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Central to the <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> is whether there was a plan to steer the proceeds of Chinn's stock transactions to Meese and whether the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> knew about it. The <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> says he knew nothing about the transactions because he had set up a limited blind partnership with Chinn's company under which details were to be kept secret from Meese as a way to protect the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> from violating rules against conflict of interest. The investigators face a wall of silence from the others involved in setting up the financial arrangements, Chinn and Wallach, who are both under indictment for racketeering in the Wedtech scandal. Wallach denied to McKay's investigators that he gave anything of value to Meese, but Wallach refused to tell McKay anything about his dealings with Wedtech, his knowledge of the Meese-Chinn partnership and his dealings with Chinn. McKay said that after the Wedtech trial expected later this year of Wallach, Chinn and business associate R. Kent London, the <b> independent </b> counsel may seek their testimony again. The <b> attorney </b> general's good fortune in stock trading began months after he smoothed the way for Wallach to discuss the <b> pipeline </b> with then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who met with Wallach and Rappaport in June 1985. Later in the year, Meese and Wallach met with Peres about the pipeline, which was never built. Also during the period the stock trading was taking place, Chinn sat on the <b> board </b> of directors of Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor that allegedly paid out millions of dollars to lawyers and lobbyists in an attempt to influence various public officials, including Meese, in the awarding of federal contracts. One of those lawyers was Wallach, who was paid $1.3 million from 1981 through 1986 by Wedtech. The stock trades that made profits for the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> took place some four years after Meese, then White House counselor, arranged for his deputy, James Jenkins, to intervene on behalf of Wedtech in connection with a $32 million no-bid contract to build small engines for the Army. Despite the misgivings of Army officials over what they regarded as a high price, Wedtech was awarded the contract following a White House meeting called by Jenkins. Meese ended the financial arrangement with Chinn last year after the investment adviser came under <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> in the Wedtech scandal and after public disclosure that Chinn had sat on Wedtech's <b> board </b> of directors. </p> 0.444618248789634  \n",
              "   Attorney General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula, will undergo questioning shortly in the <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> of her husband about her own $40,000-a-year job, say <b> sources </b> familiar with the case. The office of <b> independent </b> counsel James McKay is trying to determine whether longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending Mrs. Meese for jobs, said <b> sources </b> familiar with the probe, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mrs. Meese has retained the same Washington law firm representing her husband, said James Rocap, one of Meese's lawyers. She will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be questioned by investigators from McKay's office. McKay said last week that his <b> investigation </b> of Meese, also encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Meese's job, would continue at least until the end of April. McKay last month subpoenaed records relating to Mrs. Meese's post with the Washington chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, said a lawyer for the chapter, James Bierbower. A lawyer for Wallach, George Walker, has told The Washington Post that Wallach had suggested Mrs. Meese for a job with a local radio station owned by the Bender family of Washington. Mrs. Meese took the position with the MS Society instead. However, Bierbower said the Bender Foundation of Washington, controlled by the same family that owns the radio station, is contributing the $40,000 a year that constitutes Mrs. Meese's salary with the MS group. Calls to the Bender Foundation seeking its reasons for paying Mrs. Meese's salary were not returned. Mrs. Meese has been a volunteer for the MS Society since 1981 and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called Operation Job Match, matching MS victims with employers. Mrs. Meese also was questioned in an earlier <b> independent </b> counsel's <b> investigation </b> of Meese in 1984. In that investigation, <b> independent </b> counsel Jacob Stein probed Meese's failure to include in his financial disclosure statements a $15,000 loan by Edwin Thomas to Mrs. Meese. Thomas later became Meese's assistant counselor at the White House. The <b> independent </b> counsel found no connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by Thomas, his wife and his son. In another development Monday, Justice Department <b> sources </b> said Meese will face an ethics <b> investigation </b> by his own department's Office of Professional Responsibility if McKay doesn't seek an indictment. Such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a recommendation to President Reagan that Meese be fired. Former Assistant Attorney General William Weld's files on the <b> attorney </b> general's dealings with Wallach were moved to OPR last Friday, the <b> sources </b> said. Material collected by Weld's <b> criminal </b> division last year led to McKay's <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> of Meese. McKay said Friday he has insufficient evidence to date to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his involvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil <b> pipeline </b> touted by Wallach or his involvement with the regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he held $14,000 in Baby Bell stock. In December, McKay said he didn't have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. McKay said that if he decides not to seek a <b> criminal </b> indictment of Meese, the <b> independent </b> counsel's office ``will refer all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate administrative authorities,'' a reference to OPR. OPR's chief, Michael Shaheen, denied assertions by Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, that his office had begun examining Meese's ties to longtime friend Wallach last year. That review was halted when McKay launched his <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> of Meese last May 11, the <b> sources </b> said. </p> 0.380476725806409  \n",
              "   A top aide to Attorney General Edwin Meese III says a recent congressional report accusing his boss of violating White House ethics rules should top a ``list of sleaze.'' Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who last year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to Meese, said the bipartisan Senate report is harmful to ongoing inquiries into the <b> attorney </b> general's actions. ``We've got a process that's in place, people who are investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are,'' Reynolds said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program. ``If that is the best case that one comes up with against this <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> for ethical conduct, I would have to say that this man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect.'' Reynolds, the top enforcer of the Reagan administration's civil rights policies, added: ``If I were making a list of sleaze, I'd put that (the report) at the top.'' The report, issued Wednesday by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management, concluded that Meese's violation of the rules resulted in ``improper favoritism'' for the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. The report said E. Robert Wallach sent Meese, then counselor to President Reagan, 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing Wedtech's efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the Army and government officials' opposition to those efforts. Meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of Wedtech, but says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair hearing. Wallach, a longtime friend of Meese, is now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal. He was paid $1.3 million by the Bronx, N.Y.-company, which subsequently won the no-bid, $32 million contract. ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House policy on contracts with procurement officials, which failure resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,'' the report said. The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981 says that ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or business associate has a financial interest.'' Reynolds said the report ``made reference to a policy or rule in the White House that wasn't in existence at the time the Wedtech thing was referred over to the <b> attorney </b> general.'' Independent Counsel James McKay has been investigating Meese's ties to Wedtech, a $1 billion Iraqi <b> pipeline </b> project promoted by Wallach, and other matters. In addition, the Office of Government Ethics is conducting an inquiry into why Meese solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessman to pay more than $3,000 apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference. Reynolds maintained that despite the investigations, morale at the Justice Department remains good. ``Actually, it's very good,'' he said. ``We have a lot of professionals. Everybody in the department is very professional. ``Most of the people in the department take the attitude that is much the same as George Bush's attitude. These are investigations that are ongoing. They'll play themselves out, the process ought to be allowed to work,'' Reynolds said. ``So far,'' he added, ``nobody has suggested that the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> has done anything that comes close to unlawful activity or activity that is going to result in an indictment of any kind.'' </p> 0.369864663869631  \n",

Aug. 8, 1984: Congress approves a Reagan administration plan to move some Justice Department workers from the Chester Arthur Building and to give up 37 percent of its space when the lease expires in March 1986. March 1, 1985: Howard Bender, a Washington real estate developer, heads a partnership which completes purchase of the Chester Arthur Building for $37.5 million, nearly twice the assessed value and three times its purchase price about five years earlier. June 6, 1985: The administration notifies Congress the Justice Department intends to stay in the Chester Arthur Building, instead of moving out some employees. June 1985: Officials of the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, the major tenant in the building, forward complaints to the General Services Administration _ the government's housekeeper _ that the building's air system is causing illness among workers. Fall 1985: Officials at WWDC, a rock-and-roll radio station owned by the Bender family, offer Attorney General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula, a position as a public affairs commentator. She declines the offer. Sept. 26, 1985: Assistant immigration commissioner James Kennedy formally requests an environmental inspection of the air system at Chester Arthur. October 1985: The Bender Foundation, a family-owned philanthropy, makes known that it is willing to donate money to pay Ursula Meese as a development director of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, where she has been a volunteer. Howard Bender's wife, Sondra, is president of the foundation and serves on the MS society board. Jan. 1, 1986: Mrs. Meese begins a $40,000-a-year job, under the Bender Foundation's three-year grant. July 2, 1986: Environmental inspectors report ``many offices in the Chester Arthur Building which exhibited high complaint rates and above-average sick leave occurences contained viable aero-allergens in concentrations which could easily produce these effects.'' May 14, 1987: The GSA signs a $50 million, 10-year lease for Justice Department workers to stay in the Chester Arthur Building after the Bender partnership promises to clean the air system. The rent jumps more than three-fold. May 27, 1987: The partnership headed by Howard Bender sells the Chester Arthur Building for $60.1 million cash _ a $22.7 million profit over two years _ to an Illinois-based partnership. </p> 0.366105433666985  \n",
              "   July 8 The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on the resignation of Attorney General Meese: The last crony is leaving. Months, even years after propriety demanded it, Ed Meese says he'll resign _ sometime. Whatever conservative legacy he left the Justice Department and the courts is overshadowed by his cheapening of the office of <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> and the chaos now paralyzing Justice. ... Meese has managed to slip through the net in four investigations, because the evidence against him always was circumstantial. It just happened that cronies who did favors for Meese soon ended up with lucrative government contracts, or federal jobs or other special favors. The best Meese's investigators could find was impropriety, not illegality. Yet the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> took the lack of charges as a ringing endorsement of his innocence. ... Meese is a deal-maker, a hustler. He never understood that the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> can't use his office to create a personal pork barrel. ... Does Meese leave any legacy except sleaze? ... He tried to weaken the Miranda Rule and abortion rights before a Supreme Court that was prepared to do neither. He embarked on an anti-pornography crusade, an odd priority for someone whose mission also includes fighting organized crime. He botched the early stages of the Iran-Contra probe, perhaps deliberately. Yet, Meese has shown one thing. An <b> attorney </b> general's politics are not as important as his credibility, his honesty and his ability to lead. After three years with a laughingstock for a leader, Justice needs an <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> of high personal reputation.

              "   The elderly and students who are citizens of one country in the European Community at the end of 1991 will be able to live in any other EC nation if they wish, it was decided Wednesday. The decision by the 12 EC nations gives jobless nationals in the European Community the same rights as wage-earners. An elderly citizen who has dreamed of retiring in sunnier southern climates will be able to obtain a five-year, renewable residency permit in the EC country of his choice. The retiree must show only proof of health insurance and that he or she will not burden the adopted nation's social security system. And a student who can show proof of registration at a university or college in another EC nation as well as sufficient income will receive a one-year renewable residency permit. Those who are unemployed by choice and do not classify as being either elderly or a student will have to prove they have sufficient income not to need assistance from the social security system in their new country. The 12 EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. In 1992, the nations will drop trade barriers among themselves to create a unified Euromarket. In Brussels Wednesday the 18 nations of Western Europe's two trading blocs began talks to pave the way for the so-called European Economic Space. The move would bring the six nations of the European Free Trade Association _ Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland _ closer to the European Community. Frans Andriessen, an EC commissioner, said he hoped broad agreement would be reached near the end of this year and be fully implemented on Jan. 1, 1993, when the EC's single market comes into force. </p> 0.317949177023953  \n",
              "   Luxembourg takes over the European Community's presidency on Tuesday, with war looming in the Persian Gulf, world trade talks in disarray and Europe in full transformation. The Grand Duchy, a tiny speck on the map with only about 0.1 percent of the population in the 12-nation community, has a good track record in handling the rotating six-month EC presidencies. Jacques Santer, <b> prime </b> <b> minister </b> of the 378,400 Luxembourgers, is convinced the mouse will roar again when his country takes over the community's presidency from Italy as 1991 begins. ``During all of our presidencies we always came up with results,'' Santer said in a recent interview. Five years ago, the Luxembourg presidency paved the way for the Single European Act, an updated constitution that pushes the trade bloc toward creating a truly unified market after 1992. This time around, new initiatives to create economic, monetary and political <b> union </b> by the turn of the century have been thrust into Santer's lap. The Christian Democrat plans to act as a mediator between the EC's powerhouses - Germany, France and Britain - to finalize the blueprint for European unity. ``Because we are so small, the others do not suspect us of having ulterior self-serving motives,'' he said. Shoehorned between Germany, France and Belgium, Luxembourg occupies a key crossroads on the continent, straddling Europe's main cultures - the Romanic and Germanic. It is also well-connected with both the rich north and poor south in the community. The Persian Gulf crisis might prove the first test of Luxembourg's mettle. The EC has said it would not hold talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz unless the United States first reaches agreement with Iraq on exchanging foreign ministers' visits. If the EC agrees to talk with Iraq, that task would fall to Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jacques Poos. During Luxembourg's six months, a lot of energy will be spent on two conferences - one on economic and monetary union, the other on political <b> union </b> -to pave the way for a more unified Europe. Disarray reigns on how fast monetary <b> union </b> should be achieved, Santer said. He said calls for an independent EC defense organization are not realistic and it remains ``essential that we keep a partnership with the United States'' within NATO - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The partnership with Washington has been strained in global trade, where the EC has resisted U.S. proposals that it reduce price supports and subsidies for farmers. The agricultural dispute blocked an agreement in world trade talks held in Brussels, Belgium earlier this month. The talks are to resume in Geneva next month. Santer, stressing the progress that has been made in the other 14 sectors covered by the trade talks, said farming should not block an overall accord. He argued in favor of a final deal that, if need be, excludes agriculture. </p> 0.312941082165462  \n",

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused Friday to answer questions about Ridley's political future, reportedly leaving the first move up to him. But even rank-and-file members of her Conservative Party, who applaud his warning of German supremacy over a united Europe, said he will have to go. Sir Marcus Fox, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory lawmakers, told BBC Radio 4 that Ridley's position was now ``very bad.'' Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons on Thursday that Ridley was not reflecting government policy, nor her own views, but she rejected demands for his dismissal. Ridley, 61, the outspoken and controversial son of Viscount Ridley, is considered Mrs. Thatcher's closest ideological ally in the Cabinet. Political commentators said his departure would be a blow to her. In the interview with the conservative weekly, the Spectator, Ridley said the West German government's support for European monetary <b> union </b> ``is all a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to be thwarted. ``This rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely intolerable.'' Ridley said he opposed yielding sovereignty to the 12-nation European Community, which he said was run by ``17 unelected reject politicians.'' He said: ``You might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly.'' Earlier Friday night, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made the government's first move to repair the damage to Anglo-European relations. Speaking at the Anglo-American conference center near Oxford, Hurd said: ``Our alliance, our partnership and our friendship with France and Germany lie at the heart of modern British foreign policy. ``Lingering memories from the past do not prevent us from strengthening, month by month, the practical proofs of that friendship. ``Irreversible also is the steadily increasing cooperation with the fellow members and institutions of the European Community of which the <b> prime </b> <b> minister </b> spoke after the Dublin (EEC) summit (last month). ``Nothing will now put these processes in doubt.'' Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Liberal Democratic Party, said: ``The issue has now become not Mr. Ridley's folly but Mrs. Thatcher's judgment. By refusing to sack him, she is multiplying the insult of his outrageous views.'' Gordon Brown, the opposition Labor Party's trade spokesman, said she was guilty of a ``dismal failure of leadership'' for leaving the decision about Ridley's future in his hands. ``With this indecision following on top of the Ridley insults, her inaction today signifies an astonishing abdication of responsibility that will make Britain the subject of, at best, ridicule, and at worst, hostility throughout Europe,'' he said. </p> </details> \n",

              "   The owner of two Indian <b> elephants </b> says he'll agree to sell the 3{-ton <b> animals </b> if their former owner, who apparently has been hiding the pachyderms for four years, will return them. Richard Drake, owner of a now-closed Tehachapi, Calif., <b> animal </b> farm, said Sunday he wants to get fair market value for the 27-year-old female elephants, appraised at $70,000 apiece. Drake said he has spent ``thousands and thousands of dollars'' crisscrossing the country searching for Arlan Seidon, the man who fled with the elephants, Tory and Duchess. Seidon, who raised the elphants from infancy, contacted The Star Ledger of Newark several weeks ago from an undisclosed location and said he would return to face charges of third-degree theft if the <b> elephants </b> were not given to Drake. Seidon sold the <b> elephants </b> to the Drakes for $80,000 in 1981 but said he repossessed the <b> animals </b> for non-payment. The Drakes successfully fought the action and in May 1984 Superior Court Judge Peter Thomas awarded them $107,000 in damages. Seidon also charged that Drake, 50, and his son, Edward, 30, abused the animals. The Drakes deny that charge. Seidon, 58, fled with the <b> elephants </b> from a farm in Colts Neck Township while the <b> animals </b> were with a circus in New Jersey. He has been on the lam ever since. ``It's been at a standstill for four years,'' Drake said from his sister's Far Hills home. ``We have to do something.'' Drake said Sunday he had contacted Seidon's attorney, Isabelle Strauss of East Orange, and was awaiting an answer to his proposal. Ms. Strauss, an <b> animal </b> activist, was not in her office today for additional comment, a secretary said. She told The Star Ledger on Saturday that Seidon, who phones her periodically, would not allow the <b> elephants </b> to go to <b> animal </b> brokers who would sell them to other people. Ms. Strauss said a Vermont businessman is interested in the <b> animals </b> and that she is trying to work out a deal. Ms. Strauss has said she does not know where or how Seidon has been concealing the elephants. Seidon has said he left his farm at Fordland, Mo., and his career preparing <b> animals </b> for circus and television appearances to care for the elephants, which eat about 200 pounds off hay a day. He said he hasn't seen his four children or met his only grandson since he took off with the animals. </p> 0.443985526522564  \n",
              "   The discovery of two <b> species </b> of the daddy-longlegs insect family in Edgewood County Park may block a proposed 18-hole <b> golf </b> course. Both <b> species </b> are called the Edgewood Park harvestman, of Sitalcina minor. They live only in serpentine rock formations in the park's hills, and several conservationists want the habitate to be preserved. ``Constructing a <b> golf </b> course would wipe out the whole harvestmen populations,'' said Thomas F. Briggs, a science teacher at San Francisco Lowell High School. ``These are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world,'' he added. Briggs discovered one of the <b> species </b> in 1983 and the other in 1985. Both have eight legs, and bright orange-red bodies that measure about 1 millimeter. Unlike spiders, daddy-longlegs do not spin webs. Along with Darrell Ubick, an entomologist, Briggs has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the <b> species </b> discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected creature, which could halt any development of their only known habitat. San Mateo County purchased the 468-acre site in 1980 from the state and has been attempting to build a <b> golf </b> course there for several years. ``This little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a <b> golf </b> course,'' said Barbara Kootz of nearby San Carlos, a golfer and leader of pro-development interests in the area. </p> 0.437763169939778  \n",
              "   Endangered <b> species </b> pop up in the strangest places. Like flowerbeds. Plant-protection activists say some <b> species </b> of bulbs bought to decorate American and European gardens are being collected by the millions in the wild, threatening to wipe out those flowers in their home turf. ``The world would lose an irreplaceable treasure,'' said Marjorie Arundel of Warrenton, Va., an adviser to the Garden Club of America's horticulture committee. ``They're the ancestors of all of our spring bulbs today.'' Mrs. Arundel and other activists are urging American gardeners to buy only commercially propagated plants, which experts say make up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway. ``Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade, but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants,'' said Faith Campbell, director of the plant conservation program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of America, the NRDC has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to avoid most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or snowdrops, which they say are collected in the <b> wild </b> in Turkey. Those three <b> species </b> are listed as <b> endangered </b> in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. But this treaty _ effective in fighting trade in some <b> endangered </b> <b> animal </b> skins, horns and tusks _ has had little effect on the flower trade, Ms. Campbell said. Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey's Mediterranean regions, forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions. The popular ``Angel's Tears'' narcissus are being collected in the wild, but experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or somewhere else. Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from the <b> wild </b> in the United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and the Soviet Union appear to be the sources for still other rare flowers. Some <b> species </b> of these plants may be produced by growers in the United States or Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check the origins as carefully as they can. This may become easier, as a result of the decision last May by the Dutch Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to require exporters to use a ``Bulbs from Wild Sources'' label to identify wild-collected plants. Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label their cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor <b> species </b> and in 1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths. Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower trade, the action by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major impact, Ms. Campbell said. It is not binding, though, on dealers in the United States or other countries. Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall's catalogs. So even if American gardeners <b> order </b> from Dutch dealers covered by the rules, they might not know they were buying wild-collected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail, labeled ``wild sources.'' ``We can just hope they won't <b> order </b> those again,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``It is a messy phasing-in.'' The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in Turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting <b> wild </b> flowers to start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat, she said. Gardeners shouldn't think they're aiding nature by keeping alive a <b> species </b> that might be disappearing in its native habitat. ``We don't consider that a contribution to conservation in any way,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``It's not playing its role in the ecosystem in which it evolved.'' </p> 0.421592774982234  \n",
              "   Entomologists say they want <b> endangered </b> <b> species </b> protection for a recently rediscovered butterfly that experts believed had been extinct for more than 50 years. Paul Hammond, an Oregon State University entomologist and butterfly expert, said he rediscovered the butterflies by accident. ``In the spring of 1989 I hiked out onto a south-facing slope of a hill that had native prairie on it, and here was this very unusual kind of lupine plant with all these little blue butterflies swimming around on it. ``I knew immediately what it was,'' he said. It was Fender's blue butterfly, a relic of the ice ages found only in Oregon's Willamette Valley. The butterfly was last seen near the small town of Wren, west of Corvallis, in 1937. Since that find last year, several pockets of the <b> species </b> have been found in western Oregon. A petition is being prepared to ask the U.S. Fish and Wildlife to declare the butterfly a threatened <b> species </b> under the federal Endangered Species Act. Hammond said the butterfly has a wingspan of only about 1 inch. The male is a ``brilliant, iridescent blue,'' he said. ``They really stand out. The female is a drab brown.'' The butterfly dates back more than 10,000 years, Hammond said. Surrounded by glaciers to the north and mountains to the south, east and west, the butterfly's <b> habitat </b> was limited to a small area of the Willamette Valley. </p> 0.376721114005934  \n",
              "   A zoo advocacy group is calling for an investigation into the cause of a half-dozen puncture wounds on the head and face of an elephant that injured a veterinarian who was trying to treat the wounds. ``What we're talking about here is abuse,'' Sandra Keller, spokeswoman for Citizens for a Better Zoo, said Sunday. ``We have been receiving complaints about the way these <b> elephants </b> are being mistreated for several months.'' Veterinarian Gail Hedberg was treating an abscess on the head of a 3{-ton Asian elephant named Tinkerbelle when the <b> animal </b> attacked her Saturday, fracturing her pelvis. Zookeepers said Tinkerbelle did a ``handstand'' on the woman. Hedberg was listed in stable condition today at San Francisco General Hospital. Some officials defended practices at the San Francisco Zoo. ``We have to use elephant hooks and other methods that may appear abusive because we're not talking about puppy dogs and pussy cats here,'' said zoo director Saul Kitchener. ``How do you get a 10,000-pound elephant's attention?'' Elephant keeper Michele Radovsky said beating an elephant is no different from ``people taking rolled newspapers and hitting their dog.'' But Paul Hunter, a keeper at the zoo for nine years, said the abscess on Tinkerbell's head was caused by someone hitting her too hard with a hooked instrument called an ankuf or elephant hook. ``The <b> elephants </b> get beaten up real bad, and I'm getting tired of it,'' said Hunter. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Researchers have discovered small quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from Savannah Harbor about 100 miles downstream from the Savannah River Plant. Cesium 137, a radioactive isotope, was found in material taken from the harbor and dumped on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River, which forms the border with Georgia. Tests found tiny amounts of the material, insufficient to create a health hazard, The Charleston News & Courier reported today. The tests were done for the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department by researchers at the University of Georgia. The wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants because of <b> water </b> quality problems believed to be caused by industrial discharges into the river, agency officials said. Cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of <b> nuclear </b> fission, and is generally associated with radioactive waste. It emits beta and gamma radiation, both of which can produce a variety of ill effects, depending on the dosage. Lou Gordell, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy's <b> environmental </b> division at the <b> nuclear </b> plant, said he had not been informed of the study results, but acknowledged Monday that the material probably originated at the Savannah <b> nuclear </b> plant. The complex near Aiken produces the radioactive materials plutonium and tritium for <b> nuclear </b> weapons. The government-owned <b> plant </b> has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed that a series of accidents at the <b> site </b> over the past 30 years went unreported to the public. Gordell said sediment tests in Savannah Harbor for a 1984 study showed traces of Cesium 137, and that recent monitoring upstream found similar traces both in the <b> water </b> and river sediment. Much of the material leaked from SRP apparatus in the 1950s, but some is the result of continued discharge into the river, Gordell said. The level of contamination is far below EPA's maximum allowable level for drinking water, he said. Savannah and Beaufort-Jasper counties pump <b> water </b> from the Savannah River for drinking water. Traces of tritium also are found in the river, but also are below the maximum allowable levels, Gordell said. Cesium 137, with a half-life of 30 years, persists in the <b> environment </b> longer than tritium, with a half-life of 12 years. A half-life is the time it takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate. The Savannah Harbor is periodically dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain its depth for the port of Savannah. </p> 0.435779215217155  \n",
              "   A Massachusetts <b> company </b> is making money out of <b> garbage </b> through new recycling methods for cities swimming in the refuse of a throwaway society. Public landfills are clogged with paper, glass, aluminum and plastic, and less than 10 percent of 160 million tons of <b> garbage </b> produced yearly in the United States is recycled, according to David Spencer, president and founder of wTe Corp. in Bedford. His <b> company </b> develops methods for processing <b> waste </b> to recover ferrous metal and other substances. The <b> company </b> also runs trash-to-energy <b> plants </b> under contract with cities, and joined with such companies as Dow Chemical Co. to develop plastics recycling technology. At a research station at the University of California at Berkeley, wTe hauls in barrels of trash to experiment with ways to separate components for recycling and <b> energy </b> conversion. Spencer, 44, believes recycling and recovery, which is the process of extracting certain components of trash, will become increasingly important as cities run out of land to bury refuse, long the cheapest and easiest disposal method. ``Everything we manufacture in this country finds its way into the <b> waste </b> stream. ... It all winds up on a trash truck,'' Spencer said in a recent interview. ``To look at the increase in garbage, just look at the GNP.'' Spencer acknowledged that recovery and recycling operations are costly for cash-strapped municipalities, which must weigh such expenses as housing for the elderly against recycling programs. It often may be less expensive in the short run to bury <b> garbage </b> in a landfill, but in the long run ``yesterday's landfill is today's superfund site,'' he said. Spencer, who has degrees in metallurgy and materials science, is a Philadelphia native who, after attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, founded Waste Energy Technology Corp. in 1981. The name was changed to wTe in 1987. Now a $20 million, privately held <b> company </b> with 220 employees, wTe's operations include a waste-to-energy <b> plant </b> and recycling facility in Akron, Ohio, waste-recovery projects in Dade County, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio, and, through a subsidiary, a polystyrene recycling project in Brooklyn, N.Y. In Bedford, the <b> company </b> runs the city's curbside recycling program. Columbus has wTe under contract to use a magnetic process to extract ferrous metal from the city's <b> waste </b> stream before <b> waste </b> is burned in the city's incinerator. That makes the burning process less abrasive and wearing on city equipment. It also reduces the toxic level in and the amount of ash left over, said Tim Barr, deputy director of Columbus public utilities. Ray Kapper, Akron director of public services, said wTe was brought in to run the city's waste-to-energy <b> plant </b> after problems with hazardous <b> waste </b> and an explosion in which three people died. Such <b> plants </b> burn <b> waste </b> to produce steam and other forms of energy. Under contract with Amoco Corp., wTe developed a process for the McDonald's Corp. chain to recycle polystyrene containers tossed away with half-eaten hamburgers and paper. The extracted material is turned into trays and other products for Rubbermaid Inc. Recycling methods can be environmentally benign. For example, discarded tires, long an urban eyesore, can be burned safely to create energy, Spencer says. The 300,000 to 500,000 tires discarded in Akron annually are shredded and fed into the waste-to-energy <b> plant </b> during winter, when people traditionally throw out less trash but <b> energy </b> needs are greater, he said. Spencer said his interest in recycling comes from a lifelong hatred of seeing anything go to waste. ``My mother used to get the squeak out of the pig, as they say,'' he said. </p> 0.419788158052852  \n",

By comparison, she said, a diagnostic chest x-ray involves between 20 and 30 millirems of radiation. Luce also said that there are daily, planned releases of the gas of less than a millirem.

              "   At least two companies hired by the Energy Department as independent investigators of <b> environmental </b> and safety conditions at <b> nuclear </b> weapons <b> plants </b> are on the payroll at facilities they investigated, government records show. Others participating in the audits had bid for Energy Department contracts at sites they investigated, although they were not yet working there. Still others, while not associated with the <b> plants </b> they audited, are the Energy Department's prime contractors at other <b> nuclear </b> bomb factories. Written department guidelines for carrying out the ``independent tiger team'' investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding organizational conflicts of interest. It defines such a conflict as a situation in which a contractor ``has past, present or currently planned interests that either directly or indirectly ... may relate to the work to be performed'' and which may bias its judgment. The tiger teams were assembled by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins last summer to give an independent view of the plants' compliance with state and federal environmental, safety and health standards. The auditing work is meant to lay the groundwork for actions to correct unsafe and illegal practices at the plants. Virtually all 17 major weapons facilities have severe <b> environmental </b> problems; estimates of the cost of cleaning up production wastes are as high as $100 billion. Watkins publicly stressed the independence of the tiger teams but did not explain that many of the experts would be tied to the weapons business. The Energy Department, which owns the plants, declined to comment on whether the contractors' connections to the weapons <b> industry </b> amount to a conflict of interest that undermines the independence of the investigations or taints the findings. Department spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said the department would prefer to use its own employees for this work, ``but we don't have the people to do it.'' Each team is headed by a small number of department officials, but most of the scientific work is done by contract employees. Most have extensive backgrounds in <b> nuclear </b> <b> environmental </b> and safety matters. A review of department records as well as interviews with government and <b> industry </b> officials show that of the eight weapons <b> plant </b> investigations done last year, at least three involved companies that held other Energy Department contracts at the same sites or were bidding for contract work at those facilities. _The engineering and <b> environmental </b> consulting firm NUS Corp. of Gaithersburg, Md., was on the tiger team that investigated the Y-12 uranium processing <b> plant </b> at Oak Ridge, Tenn., last fall. According to department records, NUS at the same time was working for the Oak Ridge reservation on an <b> environmental </b> study of its <b> nuclear </b> and hazardous <b> waste </b> management. The Y-12 <b> plant </b> is one of several operations at the Oak Ridge reservation. NUS's Oak Ridge contract was awarded Nov. 8, 1988, and was valued at $1.4 million. The firm also holds contracts at weapons facilities in South Carolina and Idaho. NUS spokesman Don Couchman declined to discuss any aspect of the firm's work for the Energy Department. _Science Applications International Corp. of La Jolla, Calif., helped evaluate the Nevada Test Site, which conducts underground <b> nuclear </b> weapons tests. The <b> company </b> at the same time was working at the <b> site </b> under two Energy Department contracts with a combined value of $100 million. Most of its work is at a proposed high-level <b> nuclear </b> <b> waste </b> dump at the <b> site </b> that was not part of the tiger team audit. _ICF Kaiser Engineers, an engineering and construction <b> company </b> based in Oakland, Calif., participated in tiger team audits at the Nevada Test Site. ICF held no Energy Department contracts at the test <b> site </b> at the time of the investigation last November, but it was bidding for a $5 million job to help the facility's prime contractor, Reynolds Electrical & Engineering Co., Inc., develop and carry out an <b> environmental </b> cleanup program there. ICF Kaiser announced it won the contract 10 days after the on-site tiger team work ended Dec. 1. Similarly, records show the <b> company </b> participated in tiger team investigations at the Fernald uranium processing <b> plant </b> in Ohio and the Y-12 Oak Ridge <b> plant </b> while it was a bidder for major Energy Department contracts at both sites. The contract at Oak Ridge is valued at $505 million over five years, according to Bob Lynch, deputy director of the department's field office there. Marc Tipermas, executive vice president of ICF, said in a telephone interview that he saw no conflict of interest in his company's involvement in the tiger team work. He said he was not sure whether, in choosing ICF for the work, the department knew or cared about the company's other work at the weapons plants. ``In order to get this job done well and quickly, contractors had to be used,'' Tipermas said. ``Like many other companies, we were drafted. We were helter-skelter pulled onto these teams.'' The Energy Department has used private contractors to run the <b> nuclear </b> weapons <b> plants </b> since they were built as part of the World War II Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. The contracting system has left the department with little internal expertise in this <b> area </b> and a tendency to rely on the weapons makers to police themselves. Watkins strongly advocates hiring more federal employees with environmental, safety and health expertise to lessen the dependence on private contractors. Although the department insists that the tiger team members' links to the weapons <b> industry </b> do not compromise their objectivity as judges of <b> environmental </b> and safety conditions at the plants, some outside experts disagree. ``It's inevitably a potential conflict when a contractor is reviewing another contractor, and the reason is that any possible criticism of one contractor might lead to future business for another contractor,'' said Donald F. Kettl, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University and author of a book on government use of contractors. Other tiger team members included companies in charge of running <b> nuclear </b> weapons plants, though not the ones they investigated. These include EG&G Inc., which is the prime contractor at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing <b> plant </b> near Denver, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory at Idaho Falls, which processes naval <b> nuclear </b> fuels, and the Mound Laboratory near Dayton, Ohio, which makes detonators for <b> nuclear </b> arms. Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs the Oak Ridge facilities, participated in some other audits, as did subsidiaries of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which runs several weapons sites, and Mason and Hangar Silas Mason Co., operator of the Pantex final weapons assembly <b> plant </b> near Amarillo, Texas. </p> 0.386319810983077  \n",
              "   Initial tests by a Washington apple grower have identified an organic <b> chemical </b> that may serve as a substitute for Alar, which was banned as a probable carcinogen last year after a national scare. But a scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday it was too early to tell if the grower's initial results will hold up, and that the <b> chemical </b> would require at least two more years of study. Eric Curry of the USDA in Wenatchee said such testing generally requires three orchards in three locations around the state for three years. Spray-N-Grow, a Houston-based company, said initial results on an orchard owned by a Yakima-area grower found trees treated with the <b> chemical </b> produced apples with a significant increase in uniformity of color, sweetness, firmness and harvest time over untreated apples. Bill Muskopf, president of Spray-N-Grow, said the <b> chemical </b> ``provides the same benefits (as Alar) while remaining completely organic and totally non-toxic.'' Alar was a synthetic <b> chemical </b> growers used for two decades before a private consumer group issued a report last year saying consumption of apples treated with the <b> chemical </b> increased cancer risk in children. The Environmental Protection Agency banned the <b> chemical </b> later in the year. Unlike Alar, Spray-N-Grow is an organic chemical, a micronutrient that has been proven non-toxic in private tests, <b> company </b> officials said. It has been used by commercial vegetable growers and home gardeners for several years, the <b> company </b> said. The Alar scare pushed prices for organic apples far above those for chemically treated apples. Organically grown red apples were selling for $1.29 at a Seattle market Thursday, compared to 39 cents per pound for other red apples. Alar's most significant benefit was retaining the internal firmness of apples during months of cold storage. That will be tested with the new <b> chemical </b> this year, Spray-N-Grow said. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Feminist leaders said Friday the clock would be turned back 25 years on women's <b> rights </b> if David Souter is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. ``If we lose this one, we'll never get it back,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, who is lobbying the Senate to reject the nominee. Smeal said she had read all 200 of Souter's <b> legal </b> opinions and believes he would work to cut off women's access to <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> and abortion. Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Souter revealed his opposition to <b> abortion </b> by calling it the ``killing of unborn children.'' ``That's the language of the right wing,'' Yard said. Souter did not use the words during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings this week, but while New Hampshire attorney general he signed a brief that contained the language. However, during the hearings Friday, Souter said he has not made up his mind on the <b> abortion </b> <b> rights </b> issue and would consider both sides if he is confirmed. ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs. Wade,'' Souter in reference to the case that legalized abortion. ``I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up my mind and I would not go on the court saying I must go one way or I must go the other way.'' But Yard said that Souter's repeated reference to the <b> abortion </b> <b> rights </b> position as ``the other side,'' was evidence of where he stood. Smeal and Yard, who have attended most of the hearings, said Souter's answers to questions on constitutionally protected privacy <b> rights </b> concerning <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> indicated he believed in the concept for married couples, but left open whether single people had the same right. Smeal said the addition of Souter to the court would create the majority needed to whittle away at a woman's right to <b> abortion </b> and <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> until access no longer existed. ``It would take about 10 years,'' she said. ``First would be a requirement that teen-agers get parental consent for an abortion, then spousal consent.'' She predicted the court then would restrict the time period in which an <b> abortion </b> could be performed and then limit the kind of facility that could do the operation. Those decisions would be followed by requirements that teen-agers get parental consent for <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> requiring a physician's prescription and later that <b> women </b> get their husbands' consent, Smeal said. ``The last step would be outlawing the sale of <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> to single people,'' she said. ``That would take us back to 1965.'' That year, in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a case involving the sale of contraceptives, the court for the first time recognized a constitutional right of privacy. The decision led to widespread availability of <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> for married and unmarried people. Smeal said women's ability to get out from under the burden of unwanted pregnancies have been the key to the many advances they have been able to achieve outside the home. Smeal and Yard spoke to a rally organized by NOW across the street from the Capitol. About 150 people opposing the Souter nomination attended. </p> 0.378563889866307  \n",
              "   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a steadfast foe of legalized abortion, said Friday he has softened his stand for the tactical reason of finally getting an updated <b> abortion </b> law passed in New Hampshire. The conservative Republican, who is running for a <b> state </b> Senate seat even though he retires in January from the U.S. Senate after two terms, said he has long supported <b> abortion </b> only to save the woman's life, but now would support exceptions for rape and incest victims. In a telephone interview from his Chichester home, Humphrey said he's easing his stance ``because that's probably the only way that we can get a bill passed and signed into law that would address the 95 percent of <b> abortions </b> that have nothing to do with rape, incest or the life of the mother.'' Earlier this year, Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a bill that would have made <b> abortion </b> <b> legal </b> until the fetus could live outside the womb. Last year, Gregg vetoed a bill to repeal the state's existing <b> anti-abortion </b> laws, which date from the mid-1800s. Humphrey faces <b> state </b> Rep. Jack Sherburne in the Sept. 11 Republican primary. Sherburne favors <b> abortion </b> rights, as does the incumbent, Republican William Johnson, who is running for Congress. Humphrey said his beliefs haven't changed and that he hopes the public eventually will agree with him that ``each <b> abortion </b> kills a human being, and a human being is a human being irrespective of his circumstances of conception.'' Asked if he would revert to opposing exceptions for rape and incest if the political climate were favorable, Humphrey said, ``That would be my preference. But I don't expect to see that day.'' He said he had not discussed his new position with <b> anti-abortion </b> supporters, but expects some criticism. Warren Aldrich, legislative director for New Hampshire For L.I.F.E., would not comment directly on Humphrey's change, but said his group ``would not take part in sponsoring or originating a bill that permits the taking of an unborn human life because of the circumstances of its conception.'' ``Rape and incest are tragic assaults on a woman's life, but we do not believe that <b> abortion </b> is in any way therapeutic for the woman,'' he said. Peg Dobbie, <b> state </b> director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, was surprised by Humphrey's new stance. ``He seems like the guy who's above it, the maverick who stands up for his convictions no matter what,'' she said. Even with the modifications, Humphrey's stance ``is a very extreme <b> anti-abortion </b> position,'' Dobbie said. </p> 0.332828481610135  \n",

              "   The Idaho House voted Thursday to repeal the state's <b> abortion </b> ``trigger law,'' which sets criminal penalties of up to five years in prison both for physicians who perform and <b> women </b> who get abortions. In developments elsewhere, Cincinnati's archbishop asked <b> abortion </b> clinic operators to voluntarily refrain from Holy Communion, and Planned Parenthood said it would appeal a ruling upholding the federal government's right to bar family planning aid to foreign organizations that perform abortions. And in Alabama, a bill that would require pre-abortion counseling and an overnight wait prior to any <b> abortion </b> passed the House of Representatives 79-18 on Thursday. But the measure faces tough election-year opposition in the <b> state </b> Senate. With little debate, Idaho House members voted 54-28 to erase the so-called trigger law, which wouldn't take effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to outlaw abortion. The repeal measure was forwarded to the <b> state </b> Senate, where it was expected to pass. ``I don't think anyone in this House would like the <b> women </b> of Idaho to be subject to criminal penalties for having an abortion,'' said Rep. Gary Robbins, a Democrat who introduced the repeal measure. ``I think the <b> women </b> of Idaho are able to make their own choices, and if they do so I don't think they ought to be penalized.'' The law was adopted by the Legislature in 1973, shortly after the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision essentially legalizing <b> abortion </b> on demand through the first two trimesters of pregnancy. If it were to go into effect, the Idaho law would mandate prison terms of two to five years for physicians who perform <b> abortions </b> and one to five years for <b> women </b> undergoing them. The law couldn't take effect under provisions of Roe vs. Wade, hence the ``trigger'' desingation. If the high court were to overturn that landmark ruling, and allow states to once again ban abortion, the Idaho law would take effect on a proclamation by the governor. In the Idaho House debate Thursday, <b> anti-abortion </b> lawmakers argued that lifting the threat of criminal penalties ignores the <b> rights </b> of the unborn. ``Some of us are here to speak for those who can't speak for themselves. Do they not count for something?'' asked Rep. Elizabeth Allan-Hodge, a Republican. ``For those of us who believe it is murder to kill the unborn, we cannot possibly believe we should slap them on the hand and tell them it's wrong.'' In Cincinnati, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk said Wednesday that Roman Catholics who operate <b> abortion </b> clinics or promote <b> abortion </b> <b> rights </b> shouldn't receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. The head of the Cincinnati Archdiocese stopped short of excommunicating or forbidding Holy Communion to pro-choice activists. ``Catholics who obstinately persist in these activities, while perhaps not formally excommunicated, should not consider themselves properly disposed to participate in receiving Holy Communion,'' Pilarczyk said. Pilarcayk's statement was released after a meeting with <b> abortion </b> opponents who complained that Barbara Rinto, a Catholic who is the new director of Planned Parenthood of Cncinnati, violates church law by operating a clinic that performs abortions. Ms. Rinto has said that her feelings on <b> abortion </b> are ``between me and my God,'' and that her beliefs about <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> and reproduction are private. In New York, Planned Parenthood announced Thursday it would appeal a ruling by a federal judge there that upheld a federal policy _ instituted under the Reagan administration and continued under President Bush _ barring family planning aid to private foreign organizations that perform abortions. The policy, adopted by the Agency for International Development 1984, requires that foreign private health agencies, in return for American grants, certify that they didn't perform or actively promote <b> abortion </b> as a method of family planning. Planned Parenthood, which assists private foreign agencies, had charged that the policy was a violation of their First Amendment right to advocate <b> abortion </b> and interfered with the <b> rights </b> of privacy of people seeking family planning information. </p> 0.321669305819114  \n",
              "   A federal judge approved a settlement Thursday that keeps the <b> state </b> from restricting <b> abortions </b> to <b> women </b> less than 18 weeks pregnant. U.S. District Judge John Nordberg agreed to the settlement between Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The court finds the proposed consent decree lawful, fair, reasonable and adequate,'' the judge wrote in the 13-page opinion. Anti-abortion groups opposed the settlement, calling it ``unconscionable and unconstitutional.'' Ragsdale vs. Turnock was settled Nov. 24, just days before the U.S. Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the case. It was one of several that <b> anti-abortion </b> groups had hoped would be used as a test case for the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The settlement permits the <b> state </b> to regulate <b> abortion </b> clinics without removing the availability of <b> abortions </b> to <b> women </b> who are less than 18 weeks pregnant. Under the agreement, access to <b> abortions </b> cannot be restricted by substantially increasing the cost of the procedure or reducing the number of clinics. The lawsuit was brought by Rockford physician Richard Ragsdale, who objected to regulations requiring <b> abortion </b> clinics to be equipped and staffed like small hospitals. He said the regulation was a veiled attempt to restrict access to abortions. One of the requirements deleted from the settlement mandated that patients receive counseling about <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> and adoption and that counselors be people who wouldn't profit from abortions. The settlement also eliminated a requirement that all <b> abortion </b> clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a ``certificate of need'' from the <b> state </b> verifying that they do not duplicate similar services in their areas. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and European Economic Community officials agreed Tuesday to step up <b> trade </b> contacts. Takeshita responded favorably to a suggestion by EEC Commission President Jacques Delors to create a panel of experts to discuss technical aspects of the EEC's rocky <b> trade </b> relations with Japan, officials said. Takeshita also stressed the need for Japan and the 12-nation EEC to widen their relations beyond <b> trade </b> to cultural and scientific sectors. ``The relationship between Europe and Japan is not very strong or as well developed'' as that between the United States with Europe and Japan, an aide to Takeshita told reporters. Senior EEC and Japanese officials meet annually. An EEC official said Delors believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in defusing <b> trade </b> tensions. The EEC is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of dumping by Japanese exporters. The EEC official, who asked not to be named, said EEC Foreign Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq noted a ``remarkable improvement in <b> trade </b> relations'' between the 12-nation <b> trade </b> bloc and Japan, even though the EEC continues to register a large <b> trade </b> deficit with Japan. The gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987, but was still $25 billion. For his part, Takeshita said the EEC's plans to turn the 12 EEC <b> states </b> into a single, borderless market by the end of 1992 was good for Japan. But his aide quoted him as saying, ``The ... single market after 1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world'' and that the EEC should remove restrictions on Japanese exports. But he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade, an issue the EEC has given high priority in order to gain greater access for European goods to the Japanese market. ``We fully understand what (the EEC) Commission people are saying on reciprocity but Japan cannot agree to reciprocity on a sectoral basis,'' Takeshita was quoted as saying. Among specific <b> trade </b> issues discussed were Japan's high taxes on imported liquor and cars, the difficulties of <b> foreign </b> companies' bidding on Japanese public works projects and better access for EEC exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors. The EEC side also urged Japan to liberalize its banking sector. Officials said Delors stressed European banks must be able to establish themselves in Japan to make it easier to finance European exports and investments. De Clercq also called on Japan to quickly comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruling to amend an accord with the United States on <b> trade </b> in semiconductors. The <b> world </b> <b> trade </b> body has ruled the deal discriminates against the EEC. Takeshita also asked Delors' advice as to the best way to distribute $500 million Japan has earmarked as special <b> economic </b> assistance to Africa. ``We are aware that European <b> countries </b> have a long relationship with African countries,'' the aide quoted Takeshita as saying. </p> 0.522992875103849  \n",
              "   The United States and Japan reached a <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> Monday that could double U.S. exports of beef and oranges to more than $1 billion a year, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. ``My judgment is that this will turn out to be a landmark <b> agreement </b> in U.S.-Japan <b> economic </b> relations,'' Yeutter said following marathon <b> talks </b> with Japanese leaders. The <b> agreement </b> calls on Japan to nearly double its <b> imports </b> of beef by 1991, and phase out involvement by Livestock Industry Promotion Corp., which currently controls most beef imports. Japan would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 1991, 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to allow Japanese farmers time to adjust. Japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22,000 tons annually, to 192,000 tons in 1990. After that, fresh oranges from the United States would be permitted in unlimited quantities, at the current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 percent off season. Quotas on orange juice will also be phased out. The United States also demanded and got compensation on tariffs for other <b> farm </b> products in return for concessions on allowing Japan to slowly phase out its tariffs. Included were liberalized restrictions on <b> imports </b> of grapefruit, lemons, frozen peaches and pears, pistachios, macadamias, pecans, walnuts, pet food, beef jerky, sausage and pork and beans. As part of the agreement, the United States agreed to withdraw a complaint filed with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the <b> world </b> body that oversees <b> international </b> trade. The two sides agreed to further discuss Japan's emergency import curbs during the current round of <b> talks </b> under GATT. The temporary <b> agreement </b> was signed by Yeutter and Takashi Sato, Japan's agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. Yeutter said the official documents would be signed in Washington, hopefully in the next few weeks, after the United States gathers the documents it needs. Cabinet Secretary Minister Keizo Obuchi welcomed the agreement, telling a regular news conference Monday that ``it reconfirms that the United States and Japan are able to solve their problems through joint efforts.'' He said the <b> agreement </b> can be fully implemented without hurting Japanese farmers. Yeutter said the <b> agreement </b> ``will require some creative and innovative thinking'' on the part of Japanese officials in helping Japanese farmers adjust. However, he said Japanese consumers will benefit through an increased standard of living and cheaper prices, while Japan's economy will benefit through increased competition. He said the United States will be closely watching Japan to make sure the <b> agreement </b> is put into effect. A similar pact on computer chips came under attack last year after the United States accused Japan of circumventing the spirit of the <b> agreement </b> by selling computer chips at unfairly low prices through third countries. That battle is still being fought through GATT. Yeutter said that ``it would be unfortunate if government agencies were to attempt to circumvent the spirit of this agreement.'' Yeutter also said the United States has no plans at this time to expand its demands to include the liberalization of rice, another thorny issue in Japan-U.S. relations. However, he said he could not rule out that possibility in the future if the United States is provoked. While agreeing to eliminate the beef import restrictions, Japan retained the right to raise the tariffs temporarily by 25 percent if beef <b> imports </b> exceed the previous year's level by 20 percent. After the transitional period ending in 1993, Japan's beef tariffs will be subject to discussions in the GATT. Sato, the agriculture minister, said the Japanese government will soon begin negotiations with Australia, another major beef exporter, on the Japanese import restrictions. Associations of Japanese orange growers and cattle farmers criticized the agreement. ``As producers who had been closely following the course of negotiations, we can't help but keenly feel regret and anger,'' Mitsugu Horiuchi, president of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, said in a statement. </p> 0.519057517264268  \n",
              "   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga says a free <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> between his country and the United States is being considered more seriously because recent successes in resolving <b> trade </b> disputes have improved relations between the two nations. It is time to ``build our partnership on the basis of our interlocking strengths instead of constantly warring over our separate weaknesses,'' Matsunaga told the Washington Council on International Trade last week. The ambassador said that the much-discussed U.S. <b> trade </b> deficit and the corresponding Japanese <b> trade </b> surplus ``simply do not comprehend'' the scope and complexity of the <b> economic </b> and political relationships between the two countries. ``It is quite understandable, therefore, that thoughtful people on both sides of the Pacific are now considering the possible benefits of some form of free <b> trade </b> arrangement between the United States and Japan, the two largest and most dynamic economies in the world, whose two-way <b> trade </b> is exceeded in value only by America's <b> trade </b> with Canada...'' Matsunaga said in his Thursday address. A U.S.-Japan free <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> _ which essentially would remove <b> trade </b> barriers between the two <b> nations </b> _ was proposed first in 1981 by Mike Mansfield, U.S. ambassador to Japan. The initial reaction was widespread skepticism that two <b> countries </b> with such different cultures and legal systems could fashion a workable agreement. But earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd raised the issue with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. And Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and now Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to prepare a report listing the pros and cons of such an agreement. The interest is driven not only by the increasingly complex <b> trade </b> relationship between the two countries, but by concerns by both about their <b> trade </b> relations with other nations. Japan has concerns about how the U.S.-Canada free <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> may affect its own <b> trade </b> with the United States and Canada. And both <b> countries </b> are concerned that the lowering of <b> trade </b> barriers among European Community nations, scheduled for 1992, could lead to increased difficulty in gaining access to that market. David Rohr, a member of the federal International Trade Commission who recently visited Japan to gather opinions for the study requested by Bentsen, said the Japanese are ``really scared'' of the sweeping U.S. <b> trade </b> bill _ signed into law last week and criticized by Matsunaga as ``disproportionately protectionist'' _ because of its sanctions for unfair <b> trade </b> practices. </p> 0.4786823304804  \n",
              "   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today opened the most ambitious <b> trade </b> negotiations ever undertaken, urging officials of 90 <b> nations </b> to compromise to resolve <b> trade </b> differences. In an apparent reference to a clash between the United States and its allies on <b> farm </b> subsidies, Mulroney exhorted the delegates to ``be motivated by a spirit of honorable compromise.'' Mulroney said farmers around the <b> world </b> ``are looking for results in Montreal. They can no longer survive on a diet of promises.'' The round of <b> trade </b> negotiations is designed to liberalize and broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an <b> international </b> trade-policing treaty signed in 1947. GATT now has 96 members, and 90 <b> trade </b> ministers were at today's meeting. The U.S. delegation has come under strong criticism from Japan, Australia and the European Community over its demand to completely eliminate government supports for farmers. The 12-nation European Community is only willing to reduce them, terming the U.S. position unrealistic. Mulroney urged the negotiators to ``be animated by a spirit of realism,'' echoing similar weekend calls to the United States in preparatory consultations for the mid-term review of the four-year Uruguay Round of <b> trade </b> talks. The United States was further isolated by a tentative accord reached between the Europeans and developing <b> nations </b> that would remove or reduce tariffs on the export of tropical products to the industrialized world. An EC spokeswoman said the United States did not yet support the agreement, which would affect $70 billion in internaional <b> trade </b> of such products as jute, bananas and coffee. Michael Duffy, Australia's Minister of Trade Negotiations, told reporters Sunday that blame for U.S.-European impasse over <b> trade </b> barriers should be shared by the two parties. But he and other officials looked to the Americans to make the first move. Duffy warned that if neither side compromises during the three-day talks, ``it will sour the rest of the round,'' which ends in 1990. The dispute over agricultural subsidies has clouded prospects for progress on other urgent <b> trade </b> problems, such as the inclusion of the booming services <b> trade </b> in the 40-year-old GATT pact and the adoption of safeguards for copyrights and patents. ``It's hard to see how there can be progress in other areas without progress in agriculture,'' said John Crosbie, Canada's Minister for International Trade. The United States took a conciliatory stand but insisted it would stick to its main objective. Chief agriculture negotiator Dan Amstutz noted the United States had moved away from setting a 2000 deadline for elimination of subsidies and agreed to emergency government food stockpiles as long as they are bought on the open market. ``We're flexible,'' he said, but ``we'd rather not have any <b> agreement </b> than a bad one.'' The U.S. delegation also appeared to hold out the possibility it would relent on its rejection of a proposal lifting barriers on the export of tropical products, such as bananas and coconuts, by developing nations. U.S. <b> trade </b> negotiator Alan Holmer warned that failure by the GATT round could create ``uncertainties'' in Congress and within the incoming administration of George Bush. He did not elaborate. But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said failure on the <b> farm </b> support issue would result in an ``export-oriented'' <b> farm </b> bill. Congress is scheduled to draft a <b> farm </b> bill next year and Leahy indicated it would include supports for farmers so they can compete effectively against farmers whose governments also subsidize exports. The United States projects that its 1989 <b> farm </b> supports will amount to $13 billion _ down from the $27 million of 1987 but still a heavy burden on the deficit-ridden budget. U.S. officials say Europeans could save about $200 billion every year if they stopped their <b> farm </b> supports. But the EC, under the influence of powerful <b> farm </b> lobbies, says eliminating supports is not a viable option. </p> 0.461372217496813  \n",
              "   The United States would be happy to consider negotiating a free-trade <b> agreement </b> with Japan along the lines of the treaty reached with Canada, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said Friday. While there are no current discussion about such a treaty, it would fit into this country's overall strategy to break down <b> trade </b> barriers wherever they exist, he said. ``We have a major trading relationship with Japan,'' Baker said. ``It (a free <b> trade </b> agreement) would be something that the United States would be pleased to consider if it were something that the government of Japan wanted to consider.'' Baker's comments came in a television interview with <b> foreign </b> journalists for broadcast outside the United States by the U.S. Information Agency. The session was a preview of the seven-nation <b> economic </b> summit opening Sunday in Toronto. President Reagan, addressing the annual conference of the USIA International Council, meantime, reiterated his belief in free <b> trade </b> while saying <b> trade </b> barriers of other <b> countries </b> are generating protectionist pressures in America. ``It damages the entire <b> world </b> economy when <b> foreign </b> <b> countries </b> fail to offer the same opportunity to American exports that America offers to their products,'' Reagan said. ``It is this basic sense of fairness that has helped generate protectionist pressures in America. Let me repeat protectionism, the closing of America's markets, is the wrong response; opening markets, that, I firmly believe, is the answer.'' Meanwhile, there appeared to be movement on another contentious <b> trade </b> dispute between Japan and the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Friday that he was leaving immediately for Japan, saying a deal may be near on ending that nation's restrictions on beef imports. ``We certainly have not yet reached an agreement, but I'm persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a trip,'' Yeutter said. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We remain hopeful,'' but added, ``Until there's a deal, there's no deal.'' The Agriculture Department has placed the overall value of the Japanese beef market at $2 billion. A U.S.-Japan free-trade <b> agreement </b> would presumably be of substantial benefit to this country because U.S. officials for years have pressured the Japanese to open their markets to American products as a way of reducing the huge <b> trade </b> imbalance between the two nations. The Japanese ran up a <b> trade </b> surplus with the United States last year of $59.8 billion, more than one-third of this country's America's overall <b> trade </b> deficit of $170.3 billion. The U.S.-Canada pact now being considered by Congress and the Canadian Parliament would end all <b> trade </b> barriers within 10 years. Some critics have charged that specific <b> trade </b> pacts such as the U.S.-Canada <b> agreement </b> or the plan to eliminate all barriers between the 12-nation European Economic Community by 1992 pose risks of returning the <b> world </b> to the <b> trade </b> cartels of the 1930s, which worked to shrink <b> trade </b> rather than expanding it. But Baker disputed this, saying the United States saw any <b> trade </b> liberalization agreements as beneficial. He said America preferred to pursue reduction of <b> trade </b> barriers through the discussions being held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But he hinted that if those <b> talks </b> did not reach a successful conclusion, the United States would look to <b> trade </b> pacts with smaller groups of countries. Baker said the summit between President Reagan and other Western leaders would include a full-fledged discussion of Reagan's proposal to eliminate all <b> farm </b> subsidies by the year 2000. These subsidies are costing the major industrial <b> countries </b> $150 billion annually in higher government support payments and increased food costs to consumers. He acknowledged that the U.S. proposal to eliminate subsidies was facing intense opposition, with Washington hoping basically for a reiteration in Toronto of a pledge the industrialized <b> nations </b> made last month in Paris to press forward in negotiations on the issue. The U.S. delegation, led by Baker, had pressed for more specific language to adopt Reagan's call for a subsidy-free <b> world </b> in agricultural <b> trade </b> by a specific date. But Baker contended Friday that progress had been made in Paris. ``The fact that we are even discussing this very difficult problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress,'' he said. ``It is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all able to go to our farmers and say the <b> world </b> is going to do this.'' European <b> nations </b> have argued that it is politically impossible to eliminate all <b> farm </b> subsidies and a proper compromise would be to reduce them, perhaps by cutting them in half. The United States is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a Montreal <b> trade </b> meeting in December. The Montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current round of global <b> trade </b> <b> talks </b> which were launched in 1986 in Uruguay and scheduled to end in 1990. </p> </details> \n",

Buthelezi has denied the charge and accused the ANC of trying to destroy all rivals. The ANC was conciliatory in its statement Monday. The group said ``it welcomed the steps being taken jointly by the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party'' to stop the violence. The two sides have been holding periodic peace talks, but neither Mandela nor Buthelezi has attended. About 5,000 <b> blacks </b> have died in the ANC-Inkatha power struggle since 1986 in Natal Province. The fighting spread to the Johannesburg area in August and has claimed 800 lives. The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest <b> black </b> opposition movements, both oppose <b> apartheid </b> but differ over tactics and a future South Africa. The socialist-oriented ANC has employed boycotts, strikes, protests and waged an armed struggle, recently suspended, in its battle against the government. Inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors capitalism. The ANC draws support across tribal lines, while virtually all Inkatha members are Zulus. The ANC also has opposed Buthelezi's role as leader of the KwaZulu homeland in Natal Province. The ANC considers the 10 <b> black </b> homelands part of the <b> apartheid </b> system. Buthelezi, meanwhile, sees the limited self-government in the homelands as an interim step on the road to <b> black </b> majority rule. </p> 0.465480196432289  \n",
              "   Alan Paton, the country's best known author, was recovering today from surgery for an undisclosed ailment, a press report said. Paton, whose 1948 novel ``Cry, The Beloved Country'' drew a compelling picture of South Africa's <b> apartheid </b> system of <b> racial </b> segregation, was in ``fairly serious condition'' after Tuesday's operation, according to an unidentified heart surgeon quoted by the South African Press Association. A spokeswoman at St. Augustine's Hospital in Durban said today that Paton was in stable condition. The 85-year-old novelist underwent surgery after being admitted to the Durban hospital Monday, the news agency said. Paton's ``Cry, The Beloved Country'' is the second best-selling book ever in South Africa after the Bible. Paton worked in <b> anti-apartheid </b> politics for many years with the United Party and still contributes political commentary to South African newspapers. By law and custom, <b> apartheid </b> establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million <b> blacks </b> have no vote in <b> national </b> affairs.

              "   At an unusual prayer breakfast, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha urged three <b> black </b> African <b> leaders </b> Wednesday to ``join hands'' in regional cooperation. Botha, who represented President F. W. de Klerk, addressed the heads of state as ``my African brothers'' during the informal meeting, which was punctuated by joking and laughter. The breakfast host was Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, head of the seven-nation Frontline States, a regional bloc that once led efforts to <b> end </b> <b> apartheid </b> in South Africa. The other two <b> leaders </b> were President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who maintains close contacts with South Africa, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, the current chairman of the 51-member Organization of African unity. President Bush sent a congratulatory message, saying the meeting ``marks a new era in Africa.'' The get-together over eggs, bacon and croissants signaled a further easing of tensions between white-led South Africa and its <b> anti-apartheid </b> neighbors. Zambian officials said it was made possible by de Klerk's recent steps toward dismantling apartheid, including legalizing the African National Congress, freeing political prisoners including the ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and lifting the state of emergency in <b> black </b> townships. The ANC, outlawed for 30 years in South Africa, had its headquarters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka until early this year. Kaunda, once one of the most vocal African critics of apartheid, said the theme of the meeting was ``peace, unity and reconciliation.'' Botha told the <b> black </b> African <b> leaders </b> that South Africa could help economic development in the largely impoverished region, adding: ``We in Africa must join hands and move closer together.'' ``South Africa must play its rightful role in southern Africa and we are ready to play that role,'' Botha said. Ugandan President Museveni said he got the idea for such a meeting from a prayer breakfast he attended with U.S. congressmen two years ago. He wanted to organize something similar, he said, but as he was not a good Christian he asked Kaunda to be host. Three other African heads of state, Quett Masire of Botswana, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and Metsing Lekhanya of Lesotho, were invited but did not attend. </p> 0.443119008127283  \n",
              "   Zulus fired assault rifles at Xhosas sleeping in a workers barracks early Monday, leaving 22 people dead and pushing the death toll to 364 in a week of tribal clashes, police said. Zulus and Xhosas, the country's two largest <b> black </b> tribes and longtime rivals, have been waging vicious battles since Aug. 12 in the townships surrounding Johannesburg. Police and eyewitnesses said Zulus armed with AK-47 rifles raided a Xhosa workers hostel early Monday in KwaThema township east of Johannesburg. At least 22 people were killed, many of them Xhosas shot in their beds, they said. Police in armored vehicles moved in after dawn to restore order. Enraged Xhosas set fire to a hostel used by Zulus before being driven off. Fighting also flared in nearby townships, resulting in several deaths. Looters continued to pillage hostels abandoned by Zulu migrant workers. People carted away refrigerators, stoves and anything else they could find. Johannesburg newspapers Monday reported five killings Sunday in the Soweto township by the ``necklace'' method, whereby youths put gasoline-soaked tires around the necks of victims and set them alight. Police on Monday raised the death toll for the fighting from the past week to 364 and said hundreds were injured. ``We just keep finding bodies. They're everywhere,'' said a police spokesman. The fighting appears to be mostly a tribal conflict with a long history, but it also has political overtones. Nelson Mandela and many other <b> leaders </b> of the African National Congress, the largest opposition movement, are Xhosas. The ANC's rival, Inkatha, is a Zulu-based organization headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, the system of <b> racial </b> segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and economic control over 30 million blacks. But the two groups differ over tactics and plans for a future South Africa. ANC leader Walter Sisulu ruled out peace talks between Mandela and Buthelezi, saying it would be a capitulation. ``That means Inkatha launches a war in order to bring us to our knees. For that type of thing we are not prepared,'' he said in a weekend television interview. Mandela's wife, Winnie, warned the ANC may be forced to resume its armed struggle to protect is supporters. The ANC agreed Aug. 6 to suspend it largely ineffective guerrilla campaign. Mrs. Mandela accused the <b> government </b> of ``working hand-in-hand'' with the relatively conservative Inkatha movement in the fighting against Xhosas, the independent South African Press Association reported. Also, the <b> government </b> has revoked immunity from prosecution for three ANC leaders, including the head of the group's military wing, Chris Hani. The three men, Hani, Ronnie Kasrils and Mac Maharaj, also are members of the South African Communist Party, a close ANC ally. The <b> government </b> gave no reason for the decision. But it was seen as a signal that authorities are upset with militant statements made recently by some ANC leaders. The trio are among more than 40 ANC <b> leaders </b> granted temporary immunity three months ago so they could participate in peace talks. All but Hani, Kasrils and Maharaj have had their immunity extended until the <b> end </b> of the year. </p> </details> \n",

              "   The House on Thursday rejected a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from desecration, heeding opponents who said it would risk damage to the Bill of Rights. The 254-177 tally left the amendment, which was supported by President Bush, 34 votes short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Republicans voted 159-17 for it, Democrats 160-95 against. The <b> vote </b> followed a sometimes impassioned day of debate featuring more than 100 speeches, including a rare address by the speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``We should not amend the Constitution of the United States to reach the sparse and scattered and despicable conduct of a few who would dishonor the flag and defile it,'' said Foley, who also cast a rare speaker's <b> vote </b> to register his opposition to the amendment. By tradition, the speaker does not normally engage in debate or vote. Countered Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``Let us take the flag out of the gutter where the counterculture has dragged it and is smearing it. We have 10 amendments that guarantee us all sorts of rights. How about one amendment that gives us a duty?'' Foley told reporters that Thursday's <b> vote </b> would be the last one on the amendment this <b> year </b> in the House, but Republicans promised to keep the issue alive. ``I am confident this debate is going to go on for a long time,'' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told the chamber. Asked about the Bush's efforts on behalf of the amendment, Gingrich said ``it was very hard for the president in two days to override the speaker.'' Supporters of the amendment, backed by veterans' groups seeking more time to lobby, had tried to delay Thursday's <b> vote </b> until next week but were defeated 231-192. Rep. Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., the <b> chairman </b> of the House Veterans Committee and the amendment's prime Democratic sponsor, said of the proposal, ``I think we owe it to the brave Americans who have died for this country.'' But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., decried the attempt to modify the First Amendment. ``When I look around the politicians today, I see more people who remind me of Daffy Duck than Thomas Jefferson,'' he said. The strength of the opposition was larger than expected and was aided by the unexpected support of some conservatives. ``Up until 24 hours ago, I was a sponsor of this amendment,'' said Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C. ``But over the rhetoric of the past few days, I finally heard the voice of my own conscience.'' The amendment read, ``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United States.'' It was first proposed in 1989 after the Supreme Court ruled that flag burning was a form of protected free speech. The issue was revived last week when the court rejected last year's attempt to pass an anti-flag-burning law that the court could accept. After the <b> vote </b> on the amendment, the House also rejected a new statute _ not a constitutional amendment _ to ban flag burning. The bill, narrowly drawn in hopes of avoiding court rejection, would impose fines and jail terms for people who burn flags to promote violence or who burn flags on federal property or belonging to the federal government. Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after their leadership called it a ``fig leaf'' to protect Democrats who opposed the constitutional amendment, and it lost 236-179. The Senate is expected to <b> vote </b> next week on the amendment, which would require a two-thirds <b> vote </b> in both chambers, and approval by 38 of the 50 states, for ratification. Foley said the House would not <b> vote </b> again this year. Regardless of the outcome on Capitol Hill, Republicans promise to raise the issue in this fall's campaign. The House majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., acknowledged the political tightrope <b> members </b> were walking. Several <b> members </b> decorated their speeches with flags and other props. Rep. Gary Ackerman, trying to highlight the difficulty of enforcing <b> legislation </b> to protect the flag, held aloft a wide variety of household items and gags decorated with the stars and stripes. ``How about American flag napkins,'' he said, holding one. ``What if you blow your nose in one. Have you broken the law?'' Although Ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the debate, Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he was offended. Most Republican speakers supported the amendment; the bulk of opposition came from Democrats. There also was a noticeable generational tilt in the debate. House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., a decorated World War II veteran, co-sponsored the amendment and called it ``a measured, prudent, limited thoughtful approach to the problem.'' ``Surely this is something different from the `assault on the Bill of Rights' some critics say it is,'' he said. Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., another World War II vet, used photographs of the famed Iwo Jima flag raising and of a flag-burning protest in New York's Central Park to dramatize his support for the amendment. But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a Vietnam veteran who said he would ``never forget the sacrifices that have been made so that our flag can fly proudly and freely,'' was a <b> leader </b> of the opposition. ``In 200 years of our history, these basic freedoms have never been amended, never. And if we start now, who knows what freedoms will be next? ... Where will it end?'' he asked. </p> 0.457894118691134  \n",
              "   In an election-year bow to an agency that serves one-third of all Americans, the Senate voted Tuesday to give the Veterans Administration a seat in the president's Cabinet. The <b> bill </b> was passed by an 84-11 vote. The House <b> approved </b> similar <b> legislation </b> last November, a week after the idea was advanced by President Reagan. Negotiators from the the Senate and House will work out minor differences between the two bills. The Department of Veterans' Affairs would become the 14th in the Cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 1989. Sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard in the highest councils of government. Opponents called the <b> bill </b> another example of <b> congressional </b> pandering to special interests. ``In recent years the VA has frequently been relegated to a relatively insignificant role within the executive branch, with the administrator having little or no access to the president or other top officials in the White House,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., <b> chairman </b> of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who has been promoting a veterans' department since 1975, said his support is not aimed at getting more money for veterans. ``Given the nature and scope of the VA, it is appropriate that we make it an executive department ... (to) ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively administered.'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., a former Veterans Committee chairman, opposed creation of the Cabinet seat. He bitterly criticized some veterans' service organizations for supporting the <b> bill </b> while they fought another measure, passed Monday by the Senate, that would allow courts to overturn some VA decisions on veterans' benefits. ``If anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice ... than they already have, then I've missed something in the nine years I've been year,'' Simpson said. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the <b> bill </b> ``absurd... silly... goofy... illogical ... irresponsible. This is rubbish. This is unprincipled (prostitution) after special-interest groups.'' According to the Veterans' Affairs Committee, VA serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of $30 billion, making it the largest independent federal agency. It will dispense $14 billion in income maintenance and $626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that converting the VA into a Cabinet department would cost $33 million over five years. The biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on VA buildings. The <b> bill </b> would reorganize VA operations and allow the secretary of veterans' affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and 15 deputy assistants. The <b> legislation </b> requires that the top operating officers _ the chief medical director and chief benefits director _ be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard to politics. Voting against elevating VA to the Cabinet were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Humphrey; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; James McClure, R-Idaho; William Proxmire, D-Wis.; Dan Quayle, R-Ind.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Simpson, and Steven Symms, R-Idaho. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Paul Trible, R-Va., and John Warner, R-Va. </p> 0.404044827963029  \n",
              "   Special interests paid nearly $600,000 last <b> year </b> for speeches by a half-dozen top leaders in the House. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, <b> chairman </b> of the tax-writing committee, took in the most with $285,000, according to financial disclosure reports made public Tuesday. Rank-and-file <b> members </b> shared in the speechmaking windfall to supplement their $89,500 salaries. All told, House <b> members </b> accepted millions of dollars for speaking and writing, and many got more for talking than the average family earns in a year. The flow of speaking fees, mostly from special interests that ranged from colleges to banks, was hardly slowed by the allegations of financial improprieties that led last <b> year </b> to the resignations of Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the majority whip. Wright's successor, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported he received $32,000 in honoraria. Coelho's successor, Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., claimed $164,098. Foley's successor as majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., reported $34,500. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., was the top talk-for-pay lawmaker outside the leadership, with $160,517. House <b> members </b> are allowed to keep honoraria equivalent to 30 percent of their salaries and most give what is left to charity. Rostenkowski traditionally spreads the excess among churches and schools in his hometown of Chicago. Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia handed over $29,304 of his $67,491 in fees to the Atlanta zoo. The disclosure statements of most House <b> members </b> were made public Tuesday, although some <b> lawmakers </b> were granted extensions. Senators' reports will be released Wednesday. Speaking and writing fees were not the only source of outside income for <b> members </b> of the House, which has dozens of millionaires. One of the wealthiest, Rep. Amory Houghton, R-N.Y., an heir to the Corning Glass Works fortune, received $127,000 last <b> year </b> for managing family trusts. Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., listed dividends of $5,000 to $15,000 from his stake in a popular barbecue restaurant, Red, Hot `n Blue, in Arlington, Va. Rep. Ronald Machtley, R-R.I., earned interest by lending money to his own campaign committee. Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, pocketed a $24,000 salary from his law firm, $11,913 in Social Security benefits and as much as $15,000 from his stake in a thoroughbred horse breeding operation. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is under investigation by the House ethics <b> committee </b> because of his association with a male prostitute, was paid between $15,000 and $50,000 as an advance on a book he is writing. Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., an actor who played on the old ``Dukes of Hazzard'' show, received a $10,625 advance for his autobiography. Another ex-actor, Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, earned $26,219 in royalties from his tour on the ``Love Boat'' series. Rep. J. Howard Coble, R-N.C., won $600 in a <b> congressional </b> pinball tournament and donated it to charities in his district. Rep. Curtis Weldon, R-Pa., who once helped extinguish a fire in a House office building, was reimbursed for expenses of 19 speaking trips to fire-fighting organizations in 16 states last year. He received no fees for those speeches. Weldon is a founder of the <b> congressional </b> fire-prevention caucus. Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., earned $17,307 as <b> chairman </b> of the Massachusetts State Democratic Committee. Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., sold a 1948 Chrysler roadster for something between $15,000 and $50,000. Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., earned nearly $14,000 designing Indian jewelry. Rep. Herbert Callahan, D-Ala., was paid $12,000 in director's fees from the Finch Companies. Although Democrats, who control the House, were paid the most for their speechmaking, Republicans shared in the wealth. Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois reported $49,300. Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, who heads the House Republican Conference, was paid $31,000. As part of a <b> bill </b> raising their government salaries, House <b> members </b> agreed that 1990 will be the last <b> year </b> they will receive honoraria. Senators will allow themselves lower government salaries than House <b> members </b> after this <b> year </b> but will keep their speaking fees. In addition to their speaking fees and other honoraria, <b> members </b> of Congress and most other federal officials are required to disclose their assets, not including their homes; their investments, most liabilities and gifts. The forms require that values be listed only by broad category. For example, a multimillion-dollar holding is reported only as worth more than $250,000. Some <b> members </b> are more precise. Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., whose seniority and Appropriations Committee position make him one of the most powerful House members, listed no speaking fees, no gifts, no liabilities, no investment transactions and no membership in any organization. He listed nine properties valued at $144,978 from which he collected $4,200 in rent, and the $4,131 savings account that earned $212 interest. Not all are so lucky in their finances. Rep. Tommy F. Robinson, R-Ark., who switched parties last year, listed among his liabilities more than $250,000 he owes Jerral W. Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Jones' daughter left a $60,000-a-year job on Robinson's staff last <b> year </b> after the congressman and Jones had a falling out over Robinson's plans to run for governor. Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., reported assets of between zero and $5,000 with no liabilities. On the other hand, Gephardt, who sold rental homes in Missouri last year, had no liabilities but assets of as much as $915,000. Rep. William Green, R-N.Y., an heir to the Grand Union food stores, reported one of the highest 1989 incomes among House members, at least $507,857 and perhaps as much as $1.26 million. His campaign <b> committee </b> returned to him between $100,000 and $250,000 of personal funds he had invested in his 1984 re-election effort. </p> 0.385928898412753  \n",
              "   The Senate passed <b> legislation </b> today that would permit the death penalty for drug dealers convicted of murder, rejecting pleas that the <b> measure </b> would be a move toward ``reducing the civility'' of society. The election-year <b> legislation </b> was sent to the House on a 65-29 vote. The bill's fate is less certain in that chamber, where the House Judiciary Committee _ which will consider it _ has been hostile to capital punishment <b> legislation </b> in the past. ``Murder is murder, whether legal or illegal,'' said Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash. ``We are reducing the civility and the compassion of our society.'' But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., the bill's sponsor, said, ``I believe society has a right to say we are outraged at certain acts, and the death penalty is the appropriate penalty in these cases.'' Before final passage, <b> lawmakers </b> voted 66-28 to set aside a provision by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., that would have limited the bill's capital punishment provisions to drug dealers who are convicted of killing law enforcement officers. On voice votes, they accepted a provision that would allow prison employees to refuse to participate in executions, and rejected language that would have required prisoners to be killed in public. Both measures were sponsored by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore. On Thursday, the Senate voted 69-27 to shut off debate, ending a filibuster by opponents who had stalled a vote. ``I'm not saying the death penalty will eliminate the drug problem, but I do think it will serve as a deterrent,'' said D'Amato. But opponents decried the <b> bill </b> as election-year politics, saying it would do nothing to deter drug dealing and represented a cynical response to public demands to do something about illegal drugs. Evans referred to a similar <b> bill </b> proposed in 1986 and said: ``Once again, we're going for an election-year slam dunk on drugs. ... We're taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political vanity.'' The D'Amato <b> bill </b> provides that the death penalty can be imposed on people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring and who are then separately convicted of killing law enforcement officers or private citizens. Many states, including those with severe drug problems, already have the death penalty and it hasn't had much deterrent effect, opponents of the <b> bill </b> said. Before invoking cloture, the Senate voted 65-31 against an amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment without parole, instead of the death penalty, for people convicted under the terms of D'Amato's bill. D'Amato's <b> proposal </b> was originally attached as an amendment to the Pentagon budget bill, but opponents filibustered and D'Amato withdrew his <b> proposal </b> in return for a promise by Senate leaders to give him a <b> vote </b> on a separate bill. Supporters said the death penalty would deter drug kingpins. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said, ``To go on talking about a war on drugs and not commit ourselves to a death penalty for those who kill our law enforcement officers in that war is to make a mockery of saying we have a war on drugs.'' But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said, ``The evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent is just not there at all.'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., added that the death penalty provision could lead to the execution of innocent people. He cited a Stanford University study which said 350 people have been convicted of capital offenses in this century and then later found to be innocent. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, responded that there are enough safeguards in the legal system to protect innocent persons. ``Nobody should be able to kill our policemen without paying the ultimate price,'' he said. Also Thursday, the House Banking Committee <b> approved </b> <b> legislation </b> to make it more difficult for drug dealers and other criminals to hide their profits. The <b> bill </b> would require banks to file transaction reports with the government for all cashiers' checks, money orders and travelers' checks of $3,000 or more. Now, banks need to file such reports on transactions of $10,000 or more. New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, meanwhile, was proposing the creation of ``tent jails'' in Nevada to incarcerate convicted drug offenders and relieve prison overcrowding elsewhere. In an appearance before two House Armed Services subcommittees, Koch conceded that Nevada probably wouldn't think much of his idea. </p> 0.371477202794283  \n",
              "   The <b> chairman </b> of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says presidents should be sworn in earlier because the 2{ months between Election Day and Inauguration Day creates an unnecessary ``period of vulnerability.'' ``The incumbent president no longer has real political authority and the incoming president lacks constitutional authority, and the whole world knows it,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Friday. ``It is a period of vulnerability which can and should be eliminated.'' In a Senate floor speech introducing a resolution for a constitutional amendment, Pell said the change would eliminate ``10 weeks of crippled leadership'' and avoid an ``unhealthy and unnecessary situation.'' The senator wants to move up Inauguration Day for the president and vice president from Jan. 20 to Nov. 20. The constitutional amendment also would move the swearing-in day for Congress from Jan. 3 to Nov. 15. Pell has introduced similar measures in the past. With time quickly running out in this session of Congress, action this <b> year </b> appears unlikely. From 1793 to 1933, the swearing in of new presidents took place March 4. The 20th Amendment pushed it back to Jan. 20 beginning in 1937. Pell, who introduced the resolution along with Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., said the move also would avoid `@lame duck'' administrations in which officials might be ``tempted to expend funds, make contracts and grants and promulgate regulations that may be either politically motivated or inspired by sheer self-interest.'' Pell said the development of voting machines and instant election result tabulations eliminates the justification for the long lag time between elections and inaugurations. </p> </details> \n",

Blockbuster agreed to acquire Erol's Inc. of Springfield, Va., a <b> chain </b> of 208 outlets that pioneered the <b> video </b> rental business in 1980 but has struggled amid management shuffles and stiff competition. The deal ``provides an outstanding opportunity for Blockbuster and its franchise owners to broaden the base of ourstores,'' Blockbuster chairman and chief executive officer H.

Erol's founder and principal stockholder, Erol Onaran, said the buyout was in the best interest of his 2,600 employees. ``It was going to be a fight,'' said analyst Drew Beja at Advest Securities. ``And Blockbuster had the resources to win the fight.'' Onaron founded Erol's as a stereo repair shop in Washington in 1963. It was an early pioneer in the <b> video </b> industry, opening <b> stores </b> exclusively devoted to rentals in 1980, and led all other <b> video </b> chains in revenue until Blockbuster surpassed it in 1988. But Erol's has been stagnating since then, and didn't begin to sell franchises until last August, said Frank Molstad, editor of Video Store magazine. In contrast, Blockbuster has been expanding by 400 to 500 <b> stores </b> a year since Huizenga bought the company in 1987 for $19 million, and Huizenga has said <b> sales </b> this year could top $1 billion. Erol's had revenue of $100 million last year, said Jerry Falkner, an analyst at Southwest Research Partners in Boca Raton. While more than 1,700 <b> stores </b> by the end of the year, Blockbuster will still have only about 10 percent of the home <b> video </b> market, said Fran Blechman Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. </p> 0.400430825039905  \n",
              "   Hopes for a successful Christmas <b> shopping </b> season all but vanished after the nation's biggest retailers said their business continued to deteriorate in October. Several companies including Sears, Roebuck & Co. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported Thursday that their <b> sales </b> dropped from levels of a year earlier as consumers, preoccupied with concerns about the economy and the Middle East, avoided <b> buying </b> anything they didn't need. The disappointing October <b> sales </b> followed poor showings in August and September, and with Christmas less than seven weeks away, retailers and the industry analysts who track their performance expect <b> consumers </b> to remain frugal during the holiday season. ``They'll probaby be going in and <b> buying </b> the same number of items, but they're not going to pay as much ...'' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. ``They're not going to buy $100 electronic toys for their kids, not this year.'' Analysts said shoppers will be looking harder for bargains and waiting longer for price reductions than in past years. ``They're going to be busy spending fewer dollars,'' said Daniel Barry, an analyst with Kidder Peabody & Co. Consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait raised the specter of war, inflating <b> prices </b> of gasoline and home heating oil. The first items crossed off <b> shopping </b> lists were so-called discretionary items - clothing, furniture, home appliances and other extras that are the <b> bread </b> and butter of many big stores. If retailers have a difficult Christmas, it could contribute to a further deterioration of the economy, since two-thirds of the nation's economic growth is generated by consumer spending. Unsold <b> goods </b> on <b> store </b> shelves could also affect manufacturing - if <b> stores </b> don't place new orders, factories don't need to provide as many products and could lay off workers. And a poor Christmas season could be devastating for the retailers themselves, as they depend on holiday <b> shopping </b> for about half their annual <b> sales </b> and profits. Christmas 1989 was a disappointment for many storeowners after they were forced to slash <b> prices </b> to attract customers. Sears, the country's largest retailer, said October results from <b> stores </b> open at least one year fell 0.4 percent from a year earlier, while overall <b> sales </b> dropped 1.2 percent. Analysts believe <b> sales </b> from <b> stores </b> open at least a year - also known as same-store or comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> - provide a more accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than overall <b> sales </b> do. New <b> stores </b> tend to have extraordinarily strong <b> sales </b> that can skew a retailer's results. One of the hardest hit last month was Penney, which said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> fell 6.3 percent from October 1989, while overall <b> sales </b> dropped 4.9 percent. Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, reported comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> dropped 1 percent as overall <b> sales </b> rose 13 percent. Apparel <b> stores </b> were also affected by continuing warm weather in some parts of the country. May Department Stores Co., parent of big <b> department </b> <b> store </b> chains including Lord & Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's and Foley's, said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> dropped 4.4 percent, while overall <b> sales </b> edged up 1.1 percent. But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the biggest discount retailers, continued to outperform the rest of the <b> retail </b> industry, reporting comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> rose 10 percent while overall <b> sales </b> rose 25 percent. Analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores, especially those going into the Christmas season with high inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales. These retailers are expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise - and see their profits evaporate. Markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers, having seen one round of price reductions, wait for more merchandise to be marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts. When one retailer lowers prices, it pressures others to follow. Among other reports from retailers Thursday: -Dayton Hudson Corp. said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> rose 4.1 percent, while overall <b> sales </b> picked up 16.7 percent. -Kmart Corp. reported a 1.3 percent <b> sales </b> gain at comparable stores, and an 11.2 percent rise overall. -Woolworth Corp. said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> increased 1 percent, while overall <b> sales </b> rose 4.2 percent. The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly <b> retail </b> <b> sales </b> report from the government. The Commerce Department's figures includes <b> sales </b> from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealers. </p> 0.381226494643611  \n",
              "   The signs say ``Always Open,'' but for the first time in 35 years, most of the 1,200 Denny's restaurants across the United States will close their doors for Christmas Day. Locking those doors is a different story. Some buildings have been without locks for decades because of the always-open policy. At others, the locks have never been used and the keys can't be found. The company is having to install locks at about 700 restaurants, said Joe Herrera, director of marketing at the company's southern California headquarters. The company decided to close this year so <b> employees </b> could have the day off. ``It will cost us about $5 million in sales,'' Herrera said. The chain's 60,000 <b> employees </b> were so grateful for the holiday that many sent cards and letters of appreciation to the offices, Herrera said. Employees received normal pay for Christmas Day. ``We just feel we spend 364 days a year taking care of other people's families; for one day a year we want to take care of our own,'' he said. Nobody wants to work on Christmas, he said, and it has been the top turnover day of the year, with some managers losing four or five employees. In Hollywood, the companywide closing solved manager Almaz Legesse's problem of choosing which <b> employees </b> of a Sunset Boulevard restaurant to give the day off. ``I had a big list. ... I was having a hard time,'' she said. The restaurant, which serves more than 1,700 Christmas customers, was awaiting a visit from a locksmith. ``We never had locks,'' Ms. Legesse said. ``After so many years of working Christmas every year it's real nice,'' said Lee Sevene, a manager at a Denny's near a turnpike in Portland, Me. ``People have always thanked us a lot for staying open,'' said Frances Bushman, manager of a Pismo Beach, Calif., Denny's. ``On the other hand they always felt sorry for our waitresses and cooks,'' she said. Ms. Bushman's Denny's has locks but she had to check to see if the keys fit. Christmases in the past have been about twice as busy as average days at Denny's, Herrera said. ``We have up to an hour wait sometimes on Christmas, and that's all day _ not just at midday,'' Herrera said. ``It actually starts on Christmas Eve, and just keeps going.'' The Christmas closing applied to 1,221 restaurants. The operators of 174 franchise restaurants were allowed to make their own decisions. Winifred Gibson, a manager at two Denny's franchise restaurants in Fresno, Calif., said they would remain open for the biggest day of the year. But she sympathized with the trouble of locking up a Denny's. ``Once I needed to lock the doors on my store. It was a major fiasco. It took us a day to find the keys,'' Ms. Gibson said. Christmas Day used to bring in mostly single people, couples with no children or elderly people with no family, she said. ``But not anymore. You have so many one-parent families.'' The three franchise Denny's in Anchorage, Alaska, and one in Fairbanks will be open, said Donna Flanagan, manager of an Anchorage restaurant. Ms. Flanagan expects to serve about 1,500 people on Christmas, which is second only to Mother's Day in bringing in customers. </p> 0.363127625659827  \n",

              "   As the trademark piano received a final tuning, <b> sales </b> help scurried around the new Nordstrom Inc. <b> department </b> <b> store </b> unpacking the remaining boxes, rearranging clothes racks and getting to know the inventory. The opening of the Nordstrom <b> store </b> at the Garden State Plaza <b> shopping </b> mall in Paramus, N.J., marks the retailer's first foray into the fiercely competitive Northeast. The official debut occurs Friday when the 245,000-square-foot <b> store </b> opens for business. Members of the media were given a preview tour of the <b> store </b> Tuesday. Operating in this area might pose the biggest challenge yet for the West Coast <b> chain </b> that has been migrating eastward as part of an ambitious expansion. A struggling regional economy has shaken consumer confidence and crimped spending. Crisis in the Middle East could further curb <b> retail </b> spending as the critical holiday season approaches. Nonetheless, Nordstrom executives seem optimistic about entering the <b> market </b> and private analysts say the retailer stands a good chance to thrive here. Its service-oriented brand of retailing, combined with broad assortments of reliable quality merchandise, will give it an edge over rivals with less favorable reputations, analysts say. ``I think it's probably one of the best _ if not the best _ <b> department </b> <b> stores </b> in the country,'' said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Management Horizons, the <b> retail </b> management and <b> market </b> research division of the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. ``The fact that the competition is in such a state of disarray might make it a good time to go into the Northeast.'' Richard Pyle, a <b> retail </b> analyst at Piper Jaffray & Hopwood Inc., said Nordstrom, which focuses on women's, men's and children's fashions, shoes and accessories, is in far better financial shape than its competitors. Some <b> department </b> stores, such as Macy's _ which is a Nordstrom neighbor at the Garden State Plaza _ are courting <b> customers </b> aggressively to boost business and pay off debts. Others, such as Saks Fith Avenue, are adjusting to life under new owners who are closely monitoring bottom lines. The 61-store Nordstrom <b> chain </b> dates back to 1901 when Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom founded a Seattle shoe shop with money made mining gold in Alaska. Nordstrom still emphasizes shoes; the Paramus <b> store </b> boasts an inventory of some 70,000 ladies' shoes and 30,000 men's. The <b> chain </b> has historically prided itself on top-notch service and stories abound about its <b> sales </b> associates going to unusual lengths to please people. ``Nordies'' have been known to personally deliver merchandise to customers' homes and to write thank-you notes to <b> customers </b> _ typically on their own time. The legendary service has been a key to landing <b> customers </b> in new markets. As elsewhere, the Paramus <b> store </b> employs personal shoppers who will help <b> customers </b> select apparel, assemble outfits and accessorize. A concierge stationed near the entrance will steer <b> customers </b> in the right direction and handle special requests. Shoppers have three restaurants to choose from on the store's three levels and a spa offering massages, facials, manicures, pedicures and waxing. James F. Nordstrom, one of three descendents of the founder who currently bear the title co-chairman, said shoppers appreciate being treated well no matter what part of the country they live in. Apart from minor adjustments in merchandise mix, he said there have been no special adaptations made in bringing the Seattle-based retailer east. The <b> chain </b> already operates two <b> stores </b> in the Virginia suburbs of Washington and intends to open two more in New Jersey over the next two years, plus one in New York in 1993. Its growth strategy calls for about four openings a year. ``We just think <b> customers </b> like a lot of selection, good quality and to be treated nicely,'' he said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters. One blot on the Nordstrom name appeared earlier this year when the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries, acting after a union complaint, ruled that the company has failed to pay <b> employees </b> for some of the extras they provide. The agency ordered Nordstrom to properly compensate <b> employees </b> for work and to pay back wages. Industry analysts say Nordstrom has weathered the bad publicity without much damage to its reputation. A $15 million reserve the company set aside to pay back wage claims should be adequate. James Nordstrom said the labor problems, which have been confined mostly to the Seattle area, haven't impaired the retailer's results. Many <b> employees </b> have proven their commitment to the company, he said, by paying their own way to transfer to new stores. The Paramus <b> store </b> will have about 100 <b> sales </b> associates who have previously worked elsewhere for Nordstrom. An additional 100 managers were transferred by the company, which has a policy of promoting from within. About 900 <b> employees </b> overall will work at the Garden State Plaza store. Nordstrom's <b> sales </b> and profits haven't been as impressive lately as they had been in the recent past. Earnings slid 20 percent in the first half of this year to $49 million on <b> sales </b> of $1.36 billion. That deterioration came after a 7 percent income drop last year to $115 million despite a 14.7 percent <b> sales </b> gain to $2.7 billion. Nordstrom also has felt the pinch of the currently sluggish <b> retail </b> climate. Co-chairman Nordstrom said, ``It's fair to say that our planned increase in <b> sales </b> is greater than the increase we're experiencing.'' He said the retailer is taking a conservative approach to the coming season and will tighten inventory slightly. If business doesn't measure up chainwide for a prolonged period, Nordstrom may scale back its expansion plans. ``We're not going to leverage ourselves and grow for growth sake,'' Nordstrom said, noting that some openings may be delayed if necessary. At the Paramus store, <b> retail </b> analysts say the company is hoping <b> sales </b> will exceed $100 million in the first year. Nordstrom executives declined to disclose projections. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Early June brought a slight lull in <b> domestic </b> <b> car </b> and light <b> trucks </b> sales, which declined 4.1 percent from a year ago, but <b> industry </b> analysts said the dip stemmed from one-time rather than economic factors. ``There's no reason to think that underlying demand just for these 10 days has gotten slower,'' Kathleen Heaney, analyst with Nikko Securities International in New York, said Tuesday. ``Nothing's different in the economy for consumers all of a sudden.'' Domestic <b> car </b> <b> sales </b> in the nine selling days from June 1 to June 10 were down 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier and <b> domestic </b> light <b> truck </b> <b> sales </b> were down 2.7 percent. The eight companies that build passenger <b> vehicles </b> in the United States sold 198,647 <b> domestic </b> <b> cars </b> and 112,945 <b> domestic </b> light <b> trucks </b> in early June, down from 208,699 <b> cars </b> and 116,000 <b> trucks </b> a year earlier. Industry analysts said <b> sales </b> were higher in early June 1987 because a new round of buyer incentives had just been launched. They noted that 1988 spring <b> sales </b> have held steady and consumer confidence remains strong. Car <b> sales </b> were down during the period for all <b> domestic </b> makers except Toyota Motor Corp., which was just beginning U.S. production last year, and Mazda Motor Corp., which began U.S. production last September. ``The last 10 days of May were very strong and may have borrowed some <b> sales </b> that normally would have occurred in the first 10 days of June,'' said Michael Luckey, president of Luckey Consulting Group in Cresskill, N.J. Luckey predicted <b> sales </b> will be higher during the rest of the month. ``The consumer remains in a buying mood,'' he said. General Motors Corp. sold 6.2 percent fewer <b> domestic </b> <b> cars </b> and 4.5 percent fewer <b> domestic </b> light <b> trucks </b> than in early June 1987. GM's combined <b> car </b> and light <b> truck </b> <b> sales </b> were down 5.7 percent from a year earlier. Ford Motor Co.'s <b> domestic </b> <b> cars </b> <b> sales </b> were down 3.2 percent and its <b> domestic </b> light <b> truck </b> <b> sales </b> lagged 6.9 percent behind year-earlier sales.

              "   A veteran jockey who had planned to retire at the end of the year was killed at Belmont Park when his mount broke a leg and the man fell to the track, where he was kicked in the face by another horse. Mike Venezia, the rider of more than 2,000 winners in more than 21,000 races since 1964, died in the fifth race on Thursday's card, officials said. Robbie Davis, the rider of the other horse, was taken to a hospital for treatment of shock. Venezia's mount, a 3-year-old gelding named Mr. Walter K., was humanely killed. Venezia, 43, was the first jockey killed at a New York Racing Association track since March 29, 1982, when Amado Credidio died after he was thrown over the top of a horse onto the ground and into the path of several other horses in a race at Aqueduct. Venezia's mount broke his right foreleg going down the backstretch of a 1 1-16 mile allowance race. Venezia attempted to pull up the gelding, then went off the horse to his left and fell crosswise on the track, directly in the path of the other horse, Drums in the Night. ``I think he was dead when the (ambulance) technician got to him,'' Dr. Leo Skolnik, the examining NYRA physician, said. ``He was apparently kicked in the face. He had no pulse, no respiration and his pupils were dilated and fixed. ``I don't see how a fall to the ground could have sustained this kind of injury.'' The last four races of Thursday's card were canceled. Racing was to resume today and a memorial service was to be held for Venezia, who had planned to retire at the end of this year. </p> </details> \n",

              "   ABC only got a silver in the <b> ratings </b> the first <b> week </b> of Winter Olympics coverage, but ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was golden for the first <b> time </b> since August, snapping CBS' 20-week win streak. The first two nights of the Olympics, Saturday and Sunday, varied widely in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, but according to ABC averaged higher than the first two nights of the 1984 games. An estimated 25 million viewers saw Sunday night's coverage, featuring pairs figure skating, putting it in the top 10 with a 19.7 <b> rating </b> and a 30 share. But Saturday's <b> coverage </b> of hockey was in the bottom 10 with a 9.9 <b> rating </b> and 17 share. The <b> rating </b> is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are tuned to that program. The first two nights of the 1984 games were a Tuesday and a Wednesday, and had a combined <b> rating </b> of 13.8 compared to 15.5 for this year, said ABC. ABC's highest rated <b> show </b> of the <b> week </b> wasn't the Olympics, but the conclusion of the two-part miniseries ``Elvis and Me,'' the highest-rated miniseries so far this season. But NBC handily won the <b> week </b> ending Feb. 14, with an average prime-time <b> rating </b> of 16.2. ABC was second with 14.9. CBS was third with 14.2. After winning 19 of the 21 weeks so far in the season, NBC has an average <b> rating </b> of 16.4, and CBS and ABC are tied with 13.6. The 10 top-rated shows of the <b> week </b> were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``Elvis and Me, Part 2'' ABC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``Growing Pains'' ABC, ``Night Court'' NBC, ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``L.A. Law'' NBC and the Winter Olympics Sunday <b> coverage </b> on ABC. NBC's new ``Sonny Spoon,'' starring Mario Van Peebles as a chameleon private eye, premiered last Friday with so-so numbers, ranking 49th. The lowest rated shows of the <b> week </b> were: ``Our House,'' Winter Olympics Saturday coverage, ``West 57th,'' ``The Law and Harry McGraw,'' ``Decision '88 _ The Iowa Caucus,'' ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,'' ``The Thorns,'' ``48 Hours in Israel,'' ``Sledge Hammer!'' and ``The Charmings.'' For the <b> week </b> ending Feb. 12, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had an average <b> rating </b> of 11.8 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had an 11.1 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.9 and 19. Network analysts had no immediate explanation for ABC's showing. However, last week's <b> ratings </b> could have been affected by <b> coverage </b> of the Iowa caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential race. ``We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or <b> coverage </b> of Chernobyl, and with live programming like the Iran hearings and political coverage,'' said ABC News spokeswoman Elise Adde. ABC's prime-time special on Iowa ranked a respectable 44 out of 68. It followed the conclusion of ``Elvis and Me.'' NBC's Iowa <b> coverage </b> ranked 63rd. CBS delayed its <b> coverage </b> of Iowa until 11:30 p.m. EST, after prime time. The last <b> time </b> ABC was first in <b> news </b> <b> ratings </b> was the <b> week </b> of Aug. 10, 1987. </p> 0.673209979481173  \n",
              "   It's too early to tell how NBC's 179 hours of prime-time Summer Olympics <b> coverage </b> will score in the ratings, but the first three nights started far off the <b> ratings </b> record set by the 1984 games on ABC. Nevertheless, the first three nights of <b> coverage </b> did land in the top 10 in the Nielsens last week, the final <b> week </b> of the <b> broadcast </b> year. Sunday night's Olympics <b> coverage </b> was No. 2 among all prime-time shows, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., with a <b> rating </b> of 17.7 and a 30 share. Saturday's <b> coverage </b> came in ninth, with a <b> rating </b> of 16.1 and a 31 share. The opening ceremonies Friday ranked 10th, with a 15.2 and 29. The <b> rating </b> is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The 1984 games averaged a 23.5 rating. People meters, the new viewer-measuring devices that have shown overall lower numbers for <b> network </b> shows, combined with a decline in <b> network </b> viewing may contribute to a depression in Olympics <b> ratings </b> this year. The first three nights of the Olympics averaged about a 30 share, somewhat lower than the third of the viewing audience NBC had predicted. NBC analyst Jeff Boehme said it was too early to tell if there's a trend in the Olympics ratings. Monday night's Olympics <b> broadcast </b> continued to score disappointingly in the ratings, though it won the night for NBC. The <b> coverage </b> during prime <b> time </b> rated 18.0 with a 28 share. CBS had a 14.5 for the night, and ABC a 12.9. CBS effectively programmed against the Olympics on Sunday night with a repeat of the Valerie Bertinelli movie ``Rockabye'' that ranked fourth in the Nielsens. CBS also scored with its timely ``48 Hours'' on the approach of Hurricane Gilbert, getting the highest <b> rating </b> yet for the weekly <b> news </b> program.

              "   ABC's ``Roseanne'' edged NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' as prime-time <b> ratings </b> champ in the just-concluded 1989-1980 season, NBC announced Monday. ABC's Tuesday comedy starring Roseanne Barr averaged a 23.3 rating, two-tenths of a <b> ratings </b> point more than the Bill Cosby family comedy which has been first in the Nielson <b> ratings </b> for the last four seasons. ``The Cosby Show,'' wound up in second place for the season. Cosby's <b> series </b> has been on the air for six seasons, and Barr's <b> series </b> for two. Each <b> ratings </b> point represents 921,000 homes. Final figures for the 30-week season, which ended Sunday, won't be available until Tuesday. But <b> network </b> research analysts say that NBC will easily win its fifth consecutive season, with ABC coming in second, and once-dominant CBS in third place for the third straight season. Still awaiting final figures for the last three days of the season, Preston Beckman, NBC vice-president for research, said that NBC thus far had a 14.6 <b> ratings </b> average, ABC a 12.9 and CBS a 12.2 during the season. NBC's <b> ratings </b> are down by nine percent, ABC's are flat, and those of CBS are down by three percent, he said. He cited competition from cable, the fledgling Fox network, and independent stations as factors in the overall <b> ratings </b> drop. However, he attributed 25 percent of NBC's decline to the absence of three <b> sports </b> events it had in prime <b> time </b> during the previous <b> season </b> _ the Summer Olypmics, the World Series and pro football's Superbowl. </p> 0.598854649155634  \n",
              "   Two new situation comedies starring Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, respectively, are gone from CBS' schedule, the <b> network </b> announced Tuesday in a schedule shakeup that dumps two of the three CBS shows produced by Grant Tinker's GTG Entertainment. The network, which has ranked last in the <b> ratings </b> so far this season, said ``Annie McGuire,'' starring Miss Moore, would have its last <b> broadcast </b> in its Wednesday <b> time </b> period on Dec. 28, suggesting it might be brought back in the future. But the <b> network </b> said ``The Van Dyke Show'' and ``Raising Miranda,'' the GTG shows, would have their final broadcasts this month. ``Dirty Dancing,'' a half-hour <b> show </b> based on the hit movie of the same name will go ``on hiatus'' in January. ``Simon & Simon,'' the long-running, on-again, off-again detective series, has its last <b> broadcast </b> in its Saturday <b> time </b> period on Dec. 31. CBS left the door open to reviving it yet again. GTG Entertainment was established by former NBC chairman and MTM Productions head Grant Tinker in partnership with Gannett. Tinker founded MTM Productions with his then-wife, Mary Tyler Moore. The third GTG <b> show </b> for CBS, the critically praised ``TV101,'' an hourlong, teen-appeal drama, is being moved next month from its low-rated Tuesday <b> time </b> slot to Wednesday in place of the Moore and Van Dyke shows. GTG has also not fared well with its only other current TV enterprise, the syndicated newsmagazine <b> show </b> ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' though the company insists it is sticking by that <b> show </b> for the long haul. In the most recent <b> ratings </b> from the A.C. Nielsen Co., ``Annie McGuire'' and ``The Van Dyke Show'' were the lowest-rated <b> network </b> shows of the week. ``Raising Miranda'' was the third lowest-rated <b> show </b> last week. Both ``Annie McGuire'' and ``The Van Dyke Show'' had problems from the start. Both pilots were re-shot and the Moore <b> show </b> was partially recast. They then emerged to almost universally negative reviews, even though their stars are two of the most popular sitcom performers ever. Moore and Van Dyke co-starred in ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in the 1960s, and Moore starred as Mary Richards in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in the 1970s. CBS announced that ``Tour of Duty,'' a Vietnam series, will return to the schedule Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST. ``Dolphin Cove,'' starring Frank Converse as a dolphin researcher in Australia, will join the schedule in January in place of ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Raising Miranda'' on Saturday night. The Smothers Brothers will also return to the schedule for four shows in January and February. </p> 0.467084372161384  \n",

              "   Iraq said <b> today </b> it had moved Western detainees to vital military targets, making good on its threat to use them as human shields against a potential American attack. The message came after Iraq warned its own people not to hide foreigners or they would face the ``severest punishment.'' Iraq had threatened earlier to use the trapped foreigners as shields, and today's statement by the official Iraqi News Agency said some had already been scattered at the target sites. The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a spokesman for the Iraqi National Council as saying: ``Iraq's foreign guests have been in fact moved to all vital and military installations. They have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in good physical condition.'' The three-line dispatch provided no further details, such as how many foreigners had been moved or to what installations. Earlier, President Bush demanded that Iraq release all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, and for the first time he referred to them as hostages. ``There can be little doubt that whatever these innocent citizens are called, they are in fact hostages,'' he said in a speech to <b> war </b> veterans in Baltimore. Also today, two senior U.N. officials headed for Baghdad to urge Iraq to free foreigners held captive in Kuwait and Iraq. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein requested the envoys be sent. In his speech, Bush repeated U.S. demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. He also likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler. An Iraqi official also referred to World War II today, reminding the United States that it had once interned members of its own ethnic Japanese population. ``In response to the official American and Western declarations regarding Iraq's hosting of foreigners ... We would like to recall that America, during World War II, held about 100,000 of its own citizens of Japanese origin in detention camps to avert a potential Japanese attack on its western coast,'' said the statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. It was attributed to the Speaker of the Iraqi National Council, or parliament, Sadi Mehdi Saleh. The United States, meanwhile, picked up another ally in its military thrust against Iraq with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's announcement <b> today </b> that U.S. C-130 cargo transports have begun operating from the United Arab Emirates. Cheney's statement in Abu Dhabi marked an important show of cooperation from a <b> gulf </b> nation with international efforts to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Also today, OPEC said there was not enough support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider Saudi Arabia's request to boost oil production. A brief statement said OPEC's president would meet with some other oil ministers before the end of the month. Saudi Arabia said Saturday it would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels a day. Iraq said <b> today </b> that diplomats who fail to close their missions in Kuwait by Friday will be treated as any other foreign citizen. But in London, the Foreign office said Britain will attempt to keep an embassy in Kuwait. Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and West Germany said they had no plans to close their missions in Kuwait. The Iraqi radio message, monitored in Nicosia, warned Iraqi citizens against secretly sheltering foreigners to protect them. ``Hosting a foreigner in an Iraqi's place of residence is considered a flagrant violation of the law, for which the severest punishments will be given,'' it said. It said the law applied ``with (Iraq's) entire administrative border'' _ apparently including annexed Kuwait. On Sunday, Saddam offered to free foreigners if the United States withdraws its <b> forces </b> from the Persian Gulf region and guarantees the economic embargo will be lifted. U.S. officials dismissed the offer. He later said he would free citizens of <b> nations </b> that remain neutral in the conflict, including those of Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Portugal. They account for only about 600 of the 21,000 foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. There was growing international anxiety over the fate of the remaining foreign captives, including 3,000 Americans and 4,000 Britons, held for almost three weeks. Saddam said Sunday Westerners will be held at vital Iraqi installations to deter U.S. attacks on the facilities. ``Our people are seeking to avert a catastrophe,'' Saddam said, in comments read on Iraqi television. ``The presence of the foreigners with Iraqi families at vital targets might prevent an attack.'' Iraqi authorities also ordered Westerners in Kuwait to assemble at hotels or face the consequences. In other developments: _The White House said U.S. warships were still ``shadowing'' two Iraqi tankers, which ignored warning shots fired by the U.S. vessels on Saturday. _U.S. warships off the United Arab Emirates were challenging by radio practically every commercial ship coursing up and down the Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported today. _Iraq said <b> today </b> that Indonesian and some Argentine citizens may leave. _China's official Xinhua News Agency said the first group of 97 Chinese would be evacuated from Iraq today, with Baghdad's help. Also today, 122 Soviet citizens crossed into Jordan, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. _The British Foreign Office said <b> today </b> that 82 Britons were taken Sunday by Iraqi authorities from a hotel in Kuwait city. A day earlier, 41 British citizens were taken from the Kuwait International hotel. _Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal arrived in Damascus, Syria <b> today </b> to discuss the Gulf <b> crisis </b> with the Syrian leadership. _Two Dutch Navy frigates were leaving <b> today </b> for the Persian Gulf to join the multinational force arrayed against Iraq. The air defense frigate Witte de With and the standard frigate Pieter Florisz were to take two weeks to reach the region. _ Greece also said it would send a frigate. _Iraqi soldiers <b> today </b> continued their withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing up thousands of battle-hardened <b> troops </b> to face U.S. forces. Iraq and Iran were also repatriating prisoners from their eight-year war, which effectively ended with a cease-fire in August of 1988. _Iranian newspapers <b> today </b> attacked the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. The Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial the United States had virtually annexed Saudi Arabia, just as Iraq did Kuwait. But the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S. military presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. United Arab Emirates, an alliance comprising seven sheikdoms, <b> today </b> became the first of the moderate Arab governments in the southern <b> gulf </b> region to publicly announce overt military cooperation with the United States. On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates announced it would allow the deployment of Arab and ``friendly'' <b> forces </b> on its territory as part of multinational efforts to defend the Persian Gulf region. On Saturday night, the U.N. Security Council unanimously demanded that Iraq let all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait leave. CBS News said from Baghdad that 35 Americans, including four women and three children, took refuge at U.S. diplomatic ``quarters'' in the Iraqi capital Sunday. Asked about the report, a spokesman at the State Department said: ``We can't make a comment on that at this time.'' </p> 0.431678616653974  \n",

              "   The Foreign Ministry said <b> today </b> Iraq's failure to free 1,000 Soviets could lead to a ``tougher attitude'' toward Iraq's <b> invasion </b> of Kuwait. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin demanded the immediate release of the Soviets. He also told reporters Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq for four hours <b> today </b> to reiterate the demand that Iraq withdraws its <b> troops </b> from Kuwait. Churkin said Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia would meet with Shevardnadze on Tuesday to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis. He said Iraq agree to allow 1,000 Soviets, mostly contract workers, to leave during November but that only about 350 were permitted to do so. When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there were about 8,000 Soviets, including several hundred military advisers, in Iraq. About 3,000 Soviets, including women and children, were allowed to leave shortly after the <b> invasion </b> and about 1,000 left during September and October. Churkin said Iraq agreed to allow another 1,000 to leave in November, but is not living up to its promise. ``Iraq is not keeping its agreement that our citizens will not be prevented from leaving,'' he said. ``This is totally abnormal and unacceptable.'' He added, ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our citizens to leave, this will complicate the present situation even further and force us to take a tougher attitude.'' Churkin said that to his knowledge, no Soviets were being detained at potential military targets. ``All (Soviet) nationals are still where they were before the crisis,'' he said. Iraq has prevented hundreds of foreigners from leaving Iraq and Kuwait since Saddam Hussein's <b> troops </b> overran the emirate four months ago. It has been slowly releasing some foreigners. </p> 0.411560921062179  \n",
              "   Iraq said <b> today </b> it will put President Bush on trial Oct. 15 for ``crimes against the peoples of the world.'' Iraq first announced its plan to put Bush on trial on Sept. 12, shortly after Western officials suggested Iraqi President Saddam Hussein be tried for crimes against humanity for the use of chemical weapons in 1988 against Iraq's minority Kurdish population. Baghdad accuses Bush of planning a <b> war </b> against Iraq, attempting genocide by sponsoring U.N. sanctions on Iraq for its <b> invasion </b> of Kuwait, and committing aggression against Panama and Grenada, according to Hamid Al-Rawi, chairman of Iraq's bar association and head of a panel preparing for the trial. ``Bush has committed many crimes since he took office as president of the United States and also before that when he was vice president,'' the English language Baghdad Observer quoted Al-Rawi as saying in today's editions. He was quoted as saying the United States, which has sent more than 150,000 <b> troops </b> to the Persian Gulf to counter Iraq, had committed ``a crime against peace, punishable by international law.'' Al-Rawi said the trial would be an ``international process'' with witnesses from other countries and Arab and non-Arab jurists. It would be conducted on the same basis as the Nuremberg trials of Nazi <b> war </b> criminals following World War II, he said. Other accusations against Bush include the enforcement by the United States ``of an economic blockade against the people of Iraq with the aim of starving children, women and elderly to death, and also preventing food, medicine and baby milk from reaching the country in violation of the the U.N. charter.'' ``This is a crime punishable by international conventions which consider this an act of genocide,'' Al-Rawi was quoted as saying. AlRawi did not say what the punishment might be if Bush is convicted during the three-day trial. </p> </details> \n",

              "   Andy Warhol's plastic wristwatches of Fred Flintstone, Judy Jetson and Gumby reached $2,640 in a ``wild'' bidding war _ $2,590 more than the timepieces cost the late artist in a department store, Sotheby's said. Kitschy collectibles were only some of the objects on sale Wednesday during the fifth day of the 10-day <b> auction </b> of Warhol's possessions. There was also serious jewelry on the block. American Indian art, including ``no end of turquoise jewelry'' was to be sold at today's auction, said Diana Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America. So far, Warhol's <b> collection </b> has fetched $9,072,000, more than twice Sotheby's high estimate of $3,951,000. Only 37 out of some 1,400 lots have not sold, she said. The highest bid Wednesday was $55,000 for a pair of surrealist ear clips by artist Salvador Dali, according to Ms. Brooks. The buyer, a private collector, was not identified. The ear clips, asymmetrical ruby-studded hearts with a honeycomb center set with round diamonds, had a pre-sale estimated value of $10,000 to $15,000. An 18-karat gold, garnet and diamond circular pendant, also by Dali, brought $47,300, Ms. Brooks said. The pendant, estimated at $7,500 to $10,000, depicted the profiles of Tristan and Isolde separated by a chalice. The brightly-colored cartoon watches, made by Lewco, were decorated with raised, full-length figures of Fred and Dino, his pet dinosaur; Judy Jetson standing with hands on hips; and a smiling Gumby. Warhol bought them in 1985 and 1986 at Bloomingdale's, Ms. Brooks said. In their original plastic packaging, the watches bore the original price tags of $20 and $10, she said. ``People were so wild to have the three plastic watches in the sale. They sort of symbolize the sale of the whole <b> collection </b> _ something people will remember,'' she said. The pre-sale estimate was $60 to $80 for all three. But in ``wild bidding'' that came down to a telephone contest between four people, the price climbed to $2,640, Ms. Brooks said. A private collector, who was not identified, won the bidding. Bloomingdale's still sells the watches in some stores, said Miraed Smith, a store spokeswoman. Another wristwatch that did well at the <b> auction </b> was a stainless steel piece, dated 1948, with a photo image of Gene Autry and signed ``always your pal Gene Autry.'' Sotheby's estimated it would sell for $50 to $100 but it went for $1,870, Ms. Brooks said. Proceeds from the <b> auction </b> will benefit the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which will award <b> grants </b> to cultural institutions in the United States and abroad. Warhol died at age 58 last year. </p> 0.520168825055959  \n",
              "   Claude Monet's Impressionist painting of his wife in a meadow became the third highest priced work at <b> auction </b> Tuesday, going for $24.59 million to an anonymous telephone bidder, Sotheby's said. The price for ``Dans La Prairie'' (``In the Meadow'') broke the record for a Monet set 24 hours earlier at Christie's, which sold his painting of a blue house for $6.55 million, also to an anonymous telephone bidder. The two sales of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture by the rival firms totaled nearly $123.5 million. Sotheby's also sold a Monet landscape for $2 million and set a record price for Pierre Bonnard, whose painting of a woman in her bath fetched $3.78 million. A picture of two women musicians by Henri Matisse sold for $2.83 million. Only one buyer of <b> works </b> realizing more than 1 million pounds ($1.72 million) was identified: Japan's Fujii Gallery paid $2.17 million for Pierre-Auguste Renoir's portrait of a young woman in a yellow hat. ``The picture of his wife was Monet's most important work to appear on the market for 20 years,'' said Sotheby's expert, Michel Strauss. ``There was ferocious bidding which lasted for five minutes between two people on the telephone and no one in the saleroom appeared to be bidding while it was going on,'' said Fiona Ford, Sotheby's spokeswoman. Auctioneer Julian Barran opened the bidding at $6.8 million after Sotheby's had estimated the picture to be worth around $10.3 million. The highest <b> auction </b> prices have been paid for flower paintings by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. His ``Irises'' sold to an anonymous buyer at Sotheby's in New York last November for $53.9 million. Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was bought by a Japanese insurance <b> company </b> at Christie's in London in March 1987 for $39.85 million. Monet, a Frenchman known as the father of Impressionism and the greatest master of that style, painted his wife in 1876 when they were living at Argenteuil near Paris. The summery picture depicts Camille in a white dress and hat, with a parasol behind her, reading a book as she lies among tall grass and wild flowers.

              "   Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday it will prohibit paid screen advertising in all <b> movie </b> <b> theaters </b> showing the company's films. The policy will begin in March with Disney's release of the <b> film </b> ``Pretty Woman.'' ``Our patrons don't dislike screen advertising, they hate it,'' said Richard Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Audiences, he said, ``do not come to experience the mundane. They come to escape it. We must not so insult our paying guests (with commercials) and we won't.'' Disney plans to enforce the anti-ad policy by revoking a theater's license to show Disney movies if it shows advertisements. Cook said the action was essential to the continued financial health of the exhibition of motion <b> pictures </b> in <b> movie </b> theaters. ``We have been told repeatedly by moviegoers that they do not want and will not tolerate commercial intrusions in <b> movie </b> theaters,'' Cook said in remarks given at the 1990 convention of the National Association of Theater Owners. The Disney announcement was greeted by some groans. A number of theater owners depend on paid advertising to generate extra income. Terry Laughren, president of Screenvision Cinema Network, the nation's leading cinema advertising company, said such advertisements bring theater owners millions of dollars annually. ``It's real money. It's not pocket change,'' said Laughren, whose <b> company </b> has placed ads in about 35 percent of the nation's 17,500 first-run <b> movie </b> theaters. Cook said Disney won't demand that <b> theaters </b> break existing contracts with advertisers, but the <b> company </b> will encourage the theater owners to get out of such contracts. Disney defines screen advertisements as commercials for goods and services projected on the screen in the same theater where Disney <b> films </b> are shown. Previews of upcoming attractions, slides projected for products during intermission and approved charitable advertisements are not affected by the ban, Disney said. </p> 0.469867410541381  \n",
              "   Occasionally, an <b> art </b> theft reads like the plot from an Ian Fleming thriller in which half-mad billionaires pay slick international thieves to steal famous paintings for their private pleasure. In reality, experts said Monday, most <b> art </b> is <b> stolen </b> to earn a quick buck in an international black market that is second in size only to the drug trade. The priceless <b> art </b> <b> stolen </b> Sunday from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is too famous to be sold anywhere, raising the spectre that the pieces could be held hostage for ransom for a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars the <b> art </b> world says the paintings are worth. The true scale of the <b> art </b> underworld is difficult to gauge, but investigators say <b> art </b> thievery is increasing as prices for <b> works </b> on the legal market soar. ``There's a lot of it going on,'' said Robert W. Holmes Jr., a Boston attorney specializing in fine <b> art </b> transactions. ``Ninety percent of <b> stolen </b> <b> art </b> is never recovered. There's obviously a market there.'' Rarely, one end of the market is held up by someone who decides to commission the theft of a painting that cannot be legitimately acquired. One such theft occurred in 1983, when thieves stole Italian Renaissance masterpieces, including Raphael's self portrait, from the Hungarian national museum in Budapest. Investigators found that a sophisticated band of Italian <b> art </b> thieves, armed with cutting tools and high-tech alarm-busting devices, executed a perfect break-in and vanished with the works. An extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home country before they could get the paintings to Greece where, it was later found, an olive oil baron had paid a handsome sum for the sake of having the <b> works </b> hang in his home. ``There aren't many thieves with that sort of expertise,'' said Robert Volpe, a former New York City police detective who worked on the Hungarian case and is now a private consultant tracing <b> stolen </b> <b> art </b> around the world. ``They were capable of stealing anything.'' But most of the black market in <b> art </b> is in lesser-known <b> works </b> usually ranging in value from $100,000 to $300,000. Priceless <b> works </b> such as the Vermeer taken from the Gardner Museum are simply too famous to be sold anywhere. ``It's incredibly stupid to steal a Vermeer or a Rembrandt,'' said Steven Keller, a private security consultant who was brought in as security director at The Art Institute of Chicago after a major theft of three <b> works </b> there by Cezanne in 1979. ``He (the Gardner thief) has got some things that are too hot to handle,'' Keller said. Keller said lesser-known <b> works </b> and prints that could be sold more easily were more valuable to thieves than masterworks that couldn't be fenced. ``You might be able to sell say, a lesser-known American artist's painting in Europe,'' Keller said. ``It's harder to spot them.'' Often, thieves who can't sell <b> stolen </b> <b> art </b> underground hold it ransom for insurance money, a scenario several investigators and curators said was likely in the Gardner theft. Last year, for instance, thieves stole three paintings by van Gogh, demanded a $2.2 million ransom and returned one of the works. The others were later recovered and four people suspected of the theft were arrested. ``It happens, and it happens frequently,'' Holmes said. ``But like any hostage situation, it's got to be outside the public eye, so often these cases go unnoticed.'' Keller, noting the relative worth of the <b> art </b> <b> stolen </b> from the Gardner Museum, said, ``If I were the thief of the Gardner paintings, I'd ship the Vermeer and the Rembrandt back to the museum and go for a ransom on the smaller works.'' </p> 0.459234620845154  \n",

              "   Gang members thwarted in an attempt to <b> attack </b> rivals rampaged through the city, <b> killing </b> one person and wounding up to nine others, <b> police </b> said Monday. The <b> victims </b> apparently were chosen at random during a four-hour spree of shootings and robberies Sunday <b> night </b> throughout this central California <b> city </b> of 350,000 people, said Sgt. Mike Guthrie. ``There doesn't seem to be any identifiable pattern,'' Guthrie said. ``I think it was more driving until they saw an opportunity and taking it.'' Police <b> arrested </b> four boys, ages 14, 15, 16 and 17, and confiscated five guns early Monday. All of those <b> arrested </b> are from Fresno, Guthrie said. Each was charged with one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of armed robbery. Their names were withheld because of their ages. One suspect remained at large and additional charges were pending against the four held, <b> police </b> said. Besides the three shotguns, one rifle and a handgun, <b> police </b> seized crack cocaine from one of the youths, Guthrie said. The rampage began after uniformed <b> officers </b> patrolled a drug-infested west Fresno neighborhood called ``the U,'' said Guthrie. Five gang members intended to shoot rivals, but left the area because of the police, Guthrie said. After the fatal <b> shooting </b> downtown, one juvenile left the group, Guthrie said. The other four robbed and <b> shot </b> people along an eight-mile stretch north to near Fresno State University, then headed back downtown, he said. ``This entire scenario was an afterthought,'' Guthrie said. The <b> shooting </b> spree was ``unprecedented in our city,'' he said. ``I can recall nothing of this magnitude ... There very easily could have been half a dozen or more murder victims.'' Police blamed the juveniles for the <b> killing </b> of a 47-year-old <b> man </b> and shootings that left six other <b> men </b> wounded. Two remained hospitalized Monday in serious condition, said Sgt. Dwight Williamson. The others weren't seriously wounded, he said. The victims' names were withheld released. Three other people were injured in shootings Sunday <b> night </b> and investigators were trying to determine whether the same youths were to blame. </p> 0.619373130670238  \n",

              "   At least 100 people, some armed with guns or baseball bats, converged on a low-income neighborhood Tuesday night, apparently to protest <b> police </b> handling of a teen-ager's death, <b> authorities </b> said. Shots were fired, and bottles and bricks were thrown, but no serious injuries were reported in this <b> city </b> of nearly 40,000 people on Lake Michigan, <b> police </b> said. ``We've had shots going off all night,'' said policeman Mike Elkins. `No shots have been fired by us. We're in full riot gear.'' About 20 people had been <b> arrested </b> by 10:30 p.m., three hours after the disturbance by at least 100 people began in a four-block section of the neighborhood. State and county <b> police </b> and state prison <b> officers </b> were dispatched to help <b> city </b> <b> police </b> control the crowd, Elkins said. ``I know there were problems up there last night,'' said LaPorte County sheriff's Sgt. Mark Ludlow. ``I don't think its fair to call it a riot, maybe a civil disturbance.'' There were minor injuries, but it was not immediately known how many people had been hurt, Ludlow said. The disturbance was apparently a protest of the <b> death </b> late Monday of Chris Crawford, 16, and the wounding of his cousin Michael Cain, 17. Cain, who was <b> shot </b> in the left side, said he and Crawford were standing near a video arcade when they were approached by an unknown <b> man </b> who fought with them. Cain said his cousin was forced into the street, then hit by a <b> car </b> and killed. Cain said he was <b> shot </b> as the vehicle passed.

Police took more than an hour to reach the scene of Monday night's violence, said resident Vince Woodard. ``We called them on 911 and they didn't come,'' Woodard said. Elkins disputed allegations that <b> police </b> were slow to respond Monday. ``I'm sure in a case like that we were there right away,'' he said.

Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis apparently affects only those who were in training when time the <b> pilots </b> ended their walkout, said E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. Still, Breen said, ``It\\textbackslash{}'s clearly a major victory.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' All but 200 of the 3,600 <b> union </b> <b> pilots </b> walked off the job in sympathy with Machinists who struck the Miami-based <b> airline </b> in March 1989. Pilots ended their sympathy walkout in November, but fewer than 50 have been called back to Eastern, <b> pilots </b> association officials say. The Machinists are still striking. At least 404 <b> pilots </b> were in training when the <b> pilots </b> returned to work, the <b> pilots </b> association says. The <b> airline </b> estimates only 180 jobs are affected by the ruling, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. Further hearings likely will be determine the exact number of affected jobs, Breen said. Eastern said in a statement it would appeal the decision. The <b> airline </b> predicted the ruling wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t immediately affect current <b> employees </b> or operations. Many <b> pilots </b> took jobs with other <b> airlines </b> after the strike began March 4, 1989, but about 1,400 former Eastern <b> pilots </b> may still be interested in returning, pilots\\textbackslash{}' association spokesman Lou Baldwin said. Davis\\textbackslash{}' ruling stems from the association\\textbackslash{}'s challenge of Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s claim that the formerly striking <b> pilots </b> were not needed. Davis agreed that the federal Railway Labor Act guarantees returning strikers job rights ahead of newly hired trainees. Davis said Eastern violated the Railway Labor Act by hiring pilot trainees not already qualified to fly regular flights. The act was devised to provide ``uninterrupted transportation service,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the ruling said. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike began. It presently operates about 800 flights, down from its pre-strike <b> service </b> of 1,040. Ms. Ceremsak said she does not believe Davis\\textbackslash{}' ruling must receive bankruptcy court approval. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, all returning <b> pilots </b> would need to go through several weeks of recertification training under the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern officials said. Eastern currently has about 1,900 pilots, including those trained before the strike was settled, <b> pilots </b> hired from other <b> airlines </b> and <b> union </b> <b> pilots </b> who later crossed picket lines. Baldwin said the Eastern <b> pilots </b> trainees\\textbackslash{}' annual pay is about \\$27,000. The average pre-strike pay at Eastern for fully accredited <b> pilots </b> was about \\$65,000, he said. </p> 0.429109398698947  \\textbackslash{}n   The chairman of Texas Air Corp. Friday defended a decision by the company\\textbackslash{}'s subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, to lay off 4,000 <b> employees </b> and cut <b> service </b> as a way to ``stabilize the company\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' by cutting losses. Frank Lorenzo, testifying at a federal court hearing on Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s plans to eliminate <b> service </b> to 14 cities, said the layoffs and schedule changes were a necessary step to save the financially troubled carrier. ``If Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s management is not permitted to take the actions to save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lorenzo said, rejecting suggestions by <b> union </b> attorneys that he was trying to bust organized <b> labor </b> at Eastern by transferring the carrier\\textbackslash{}'s assets to Continental Airlines, another Texas Air property. Three <b> labor </b> <b> unions </b> that represent Eastern <b> employees </b> have challenged the plans and obtained a temporary restraining order that bars the <b> airline </b> from making layoffs. U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker is holding hearings on the union\\textbackslash{}'s bid for a permanent injunction. Lorenzo defended the proposed cutbacks ``as an attempt to stabilize the company ... and decrease the losses.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Eastern currently is in federally supervised contract negotiations with two of its unions, the Association of Air Line Pilots and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Lorenzo denied suggestions that Texas Air planned to merge Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s operations into Continental. Union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that Lorenzo was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air had purchased Eastern. The draft said that the purchase of Eastern gave Texas Air leverage over the unions. ``Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s airplanes can be repainted and moved over to Continental where they will be flown by non-union pilots,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the speech draft said. But Lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking firm. It was unclear from the testimony if Lorenzo ever delivered that portion of the speech. </p> 0.40322963681166  \\textbackslash{}n   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it has canceled its contract with Orion Air Inc. to provide strike-replacement pilots, but pledged to remain flying in the event of <b> labor </b> troubles. Eastern, preparing for tough negotiations with the Machinists <b> union </b> on its expiring <b> labor </b> pact, had contracted with Orion in case its own <b> pilots </b> refused to cross picket lines, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. But U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington ruled in March that the deal with Orion violated the existing contract between Eastern and its <b> pilots </b> union. Replacements cannot be trained until a strike begins, the judge said. Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., is one of the largest U.S. operators of aircraft for the small package industry. Miami-based Eastern, the nation\\textbackslash{}'s sixth-largest airline, is a subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp. The Transport Workers Union filed a similar suit in April, accusing Eastern of using its planes to train Orion <b> flight </b> attendants to break a strike. Ms. Ceremsak refused to attribute the cancellation of the Orion contract to Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s legal setbacks, however. The contract was terminated ``for sound business reasons,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Ms. Ceremsak. ``Beyond that I can\\textbackslash{}'t elaborate.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The decision to end the contract does not mean that financially troubled Eastern will shut down if the Machinists walk out, the spokeswoman said. ``We do have plans to operate in case of a strike,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. ``But our first priority is still reaching a settlement\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' with the Machinists. J.B. Stokes, a spokesman for the <b> pilots </b> <b> union </b> at Eastern, said the federal court decisions against Eastern left the carrier with no choice. ``This is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey court orders,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Stokes. ``The judge said you cannot train (replacement) <b> pilots </b> in any capacity until such time as there is a strike.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The cancellation will cost Eastern about \\$5.5 million under a provision of the Orion contract, Stokes said. Ms. Ceremsak refused to comment on any provisions of the contract or its cancellation. </p> 0.386984049004294  \\textbackslash{}n   The obscure cargo <b> airline </b> that Eastern Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces questions about its safety record as the government decides whether it is fit to carry passengers. Few <b> air </b> travelers have ever heard of Orion Air, a North Carolina cargo carrier which serves such <b> air </b> freight companies as United Parcel Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator. But if <b> labor </b> strife intensifies at Eastern, many of that airline\\textbackslash{}'s customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion \\_ and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up scrutiny of the airline. Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion, including the leasing of 26 of Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s jetliners, that call on the <b> airline </b> to take over much of Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s routes if <b> pilots </b> and mechanics go on strike. Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own <b> pilots </b> and ground workers, Eastern officials said. But the FAA has yet to approve Orion for passenger service, and a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against Orion because of past safety violations. An FAA inspection report on Orion shows ``a large number of serious safety infractions,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Anthony Broderick, the FAA\\textbackslash{}'s associate administrator for aviation standards. Broderick said the airline\\textbackslash{}'s management has taken actions ``to permit Orion to safely operate its cargo business\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and training and maintenance procedures ``are being corrected to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' At congressional hearings Tuesday, James L. Heffernan, an Orion vice president, said problems cited by the FAA have been corrected. Heffernan called Orion\\textbackslash{}'s safety record excellent and maintained that much of the FAA\\textbackslash{}'s concerns stemmed from a ``misunderstanding\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' by FAA inspectors about Orion\\textbackslash{}'s method of record keeping. ``Orion Air responded to each of the FAA\\textbackslash{}'s proposed findings last summer and are still in the process of resolving these issues. Obviously, if any of the issues compromised <b> air </b> safety, the FAA would not have allowed Orion Air to continue to operate,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Heffernan continued. But Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairman of the House government operations and transportation subcommittee, called Orion ``an <b> airline </b> in near-shambles\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and raised questions about its fitness to fly passengers. In an interview, Steven Kolski, a vice president of Eastern, said Eastern executives believe Orion\\textbackslash{}'s past safety problems have been resolved. He expressed confidence that the airline\\textbackslash{}'s fitness will be assured before the FAA allows it to engage in passenger-carrying flights. ``We got a report that said they (Orion) are a hell of a lot better today than they were a year ago and that most, if not all, of their problems were behind them and they were in good shape,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Kolski. Kolski said Eastern is relying on the agreement with Orion to keep Eastern\\textbackslash{}'s <b> service </b> going if its 10,000 mechanics go on strike and its 4,000 <b> pilots </b> refuse to cross the picket lines. But FAA officials were not as certain that all of Orion\\textbackslash{}'s safety shortcomings are behind it. The FAA cited ``systemic difficulties\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' with the airline\\textbackslash{}'s training program, record keeping and use of operational handbooks that are not yet corrected. And the agency disclosed it was seeking civil penalties against Orion for past violations, although no amounts were cited. ``Once the systemic problems have all been corrected, the FAA will turn its attention toward developing an appropriate enforcement package, including a proposed fine\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for past violations, Broderick said. Orion\\textbackslash{}'s problems stem from safety violations found in early 1987 \\_ violations that attracted little public attention because Orion\\textbackslash{}'s 55 jets were carrying only cargo. Among the findings by FAA inspectors were a shortage of required training records; inadequate auditing of maintenance facilites; poor documentation on the qualifications of ``check pilots\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' who decide on the performance of line pilots; incomplete <b> flight </b> operations manuals, instances of <b> pilots </b> failing to go through required refresher training; and training programs that did not meet federal standards. In a related development Tuesday, the FAA made public a report on improvements Eastern Airlines has made in its own maintenance program since the <b> airline </b> was fined a record \\$9.5 million two years ago. The FAA said that Eastern has made ``substantial progress\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to correct past deficiencies, but that some concerns remain about the airline\\textbackslash{}'s deferred maintenance program and repeated problems with certain equipment. Nevertheless, Eastern officials hailed the latest FAA findings which showed that corrective actions had been taken in 52 of the 53 areas cited by the FAA two years ago. ``We are very pleased. This report shows that Eastern has corrected the deficiencies,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Kolski. </p> 0.34912563695709  \\textbackslash{}n   Northwest Airlines is offering <b> flight </b> attendants two free first-class tickets anywhere in the world for reporting as scheduled for holiday duty. It\\textbackslash{}'s an attempt to cut down on sick calls over the holidays. In a recent letter to workers, Northwest in-flight services chief Lloyd Warren thanked <b> flight </b> attendants in advance for reporting for holiday duty. And as ``a token of our thanks,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Warren said, two free round-trip tickets in first-class seating would be given to <b> flight </b> attendants who report as scheduled between Dec. 15 and Jan. 1. Northwest employs more than 8,000 <b> flight </b> attendants. To qualify, workers must be scheduled for flights on Dec. 24, Dec. 25, Dec. 31 or Jan. 1. Service charges that normally accompany worker flight-pass privileges would be waived. Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said that last year, <b> flight </b> attendants were offered a \\$100 cash bonus for working through the holidays. Miller said the offer does not reflect a problem with holiday sick leave in the ranks of <b> flight </b> attendants. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s just that when we\\textbackslash{}'re in crunch time like we are around the holidays, every single person is key to our success,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  mrs family hospital wife children son mother home life husband medical daughter father child heart condition center died surgery woman </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.609962531058814  \\textbackslash{}n   Loma Linda Medical Center said Friday has accepted a fourth baby born with most of his brain missing and will keep it alive for up to a week in hopes that its organs can be used for transplant. The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified Southern California <b> hospital </b> Thursday and transferred to Loma Linda University Medical Center, said Anita Rockwell, a spokeswoman for the center. Baby D suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is missing. The <b> condition </b> almost always leads to death within days or weeks. ``His parents want to donate their baby\\textbackslash{}'s organs when brain death occurs,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Rockwell said. Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda chief of neonatology, said Baby D was resting comfortably Friday and receiving nutrition and water as needed. Rockwell said the newborn will be cared for for a seven-day period that began Thursday night. Under Loma Linda policy, Baby D will be placed on <b> life </b> support if needed to prevent damage to organs. If Baby D is declared brain-dead within seven days, the <b> hospital </b> will give notice that his organs are available for transplant. If he isn\\textbackslash{}'t brain dead within seven days, he will be allowed to die. The time limit was developed to alleviate ethical concerns that doomed anencephalics not be kept alive indefinitely merely so their organs can be donated. Rockwell said anonymity was requested by Baby D\\textbackslash{}'s parents and officials of the <b> hospital </b> where he was born. Baby D is the fourth anencephalic newborn accepted as a possible organ donor at the hospital. The first was stillborn Dec. 23, thwarting her parents\\textbackslash{}' desire to have her major organs donated. Her corneas and <b> heart </b> valves were given to infants needing them. The second anencephalic was declared brain-dead Feb. 18. Attempts to donate his liver failed because potential recipients either weren\\textbackslash{}'t suitable matches or couldn\\textbackslash{}'t be operated on in time. He was disconnected from life-support Feb. 20. Most recently, a girl was transferred to Loma Linda after birth Feb. 20. Because she never met brain-death criteria within the seven-day limit, she was disconnected from a respirator and allowed to die on Feb. 28. However, her eyes, corneas and <b> heart </b> valves were later donated to infants needing organs. Loma Linda gained worldwide attention in 1984 when Dr. Leonard Bailey, frustrated at the lack of <b> heart </b> donors for babies, transplanted a baboon\\textbackslash{}'s <b> heart </b> into a girl known as Baby Fae. She <b> died </b> 20\\{ days later. Bailey, whose baboon transplant was sharply criticized by many doctors, subsequently urged the use of anencephalics as donors of hearts and other organs. </p> 0.53641965260323  \\textbackslash{}n   Police on Friday sought a 12-year-old girl needing <b> heart </b> <b> surgery </b> and her mother, who authorities said abducted the girl from a <b> hospital </b> because the woman\\textbackslash{}'s religion forbids blood transfusions. The girl, Kimberly Winfield, was believed to have left Children\\textbackslash{}'s Memorial Hospital about 1 a.m. Thursday, said police Lt. Edmund Beazley. The mother, Caroline Winfield, called relatives to say she wanted to return her daughter, said Dave Schneidman, spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. But she was afraid to surrender for fear of being prosecuted. Police obtained an arrest warrant for the 35-year-old <b> mother </b> on a charge of <b> child </b> abduction because Kimberly is a ward of the state, Beazley said. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re not real interested in catching the <b> mother </b> if she doesn\\textbackslash{}'t want to be caught, but we do want the <b> child </b> back so we can save the child\\textbackslash{}'s life,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Schneidman said. Police and the state Department of Children and Family Services said they were reasonably certain the <b> mother </b> was responsible for the child\\textbackslash{}'s disappearance. ``There doesn\\textbackslash{}'t seem to be any doubt of it right now,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Beazley said. ``Before the <b> child </b> was discovered missing, the <b> mother </b> had told relatives that she was going to take the <b> child </b> from the <b> hospital </b> because she did not approve of the surgery,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said department spokesman Schneidman. Schneidman said the <b> child </b> needed open-heart <b> surgery </b> to survive. ``The prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live without the surgery,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. However, Children\\textbackslash{}'s Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Jan Benzies said Kimberly, who was admitted Wednesday, was not critically ill. ``She was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her <b> heart </b> problem,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the spokeswoman said. ``Her doctor does not believe her <b> life </b> is in immediate danger. ``However, it is clinically advisable that she be located and treated within a month,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. No one at the <b> hospital </b> saw the <b> mother </b> or <b> child </b> leave, Beazley said. ``Apparently, she just got her dressed and walked out,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``They were allowing the <b> mother </b> to stay in the room with her, which is pretty common with young children. The nurse came back to check on them and they were both gone.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The <b> mother </b> is a Jehovah\\textbackslash{}'s Witness, Beazley said. Jehovah\\textbackslash{}'s Witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against the teachings of the Bible. ``You can\\textbackslash{}'t do <b> surgery </b> without a transfusion of blood,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Schneidman said. The Department of Children and Family Services waited about 34 hours after the disappearance to notify the press so police could check leads on Winfield\\textbackslash{}'s whereabouts, Schneidman said. Those leads were exhausted, he said. The agency was named temporary custodian of Kimberly and two brothers, ages 2 and 8, about a month ago because Winfield was unable to care for them, Schneidman said. ``They were living on the streets without proper housing or any evident means of support,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Schneidman said. The boys, whose names were not released, are now living with their paternal grandmother in Chicago, Beazley said. A department caseworker noticed Kimberly was ill and took her to the hospital, Schneidman said. Larry Winfield, Kimberly\\textbackslash{}'s father, had been notified and was very concerned, Schneidman said. He maintains a permanent residence and is employed, but the <b> mother </b> and <b> children </b> have not lived with him for some time, Schneidman said. </p> 0.451325934329735  \\textbackslash{}n   Do all things get cheaper by the dozen \\_ even children?

On March 9, Day suffered a head injury in a fall at his Bel Air home, and underwent emergency treatment to relieve the pressure caused by bleeding in the brain.

Lang teamed with Dr. William Pelham of the University of Pittsburgh to conduct the research. ``Our studies show how the destructive role of alcohol in parent-child interactions is a two-way street,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lang said. ``Problem drinkers make <b> poor </b> parents, but problem <b> children </b> may also drive <b> parents </b> to drink.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said the findings are similar to those of studies that show <b> children </b> who are mentally retarded or have serious behavioral problems are abused more often than normal, obedient children. ``The point is that while we usually think of <b> parents </b> as influencers of children, <b> children </b> can affect <b> parents </b> as well,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lang said. ``And the outcome is not always favorable.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dr. Robin Room, scientific director of the Alchohol Research Group of the Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, wasn\\textbackslash{}'t surprised by the findings but said it was important to look into the cause of drinking among parents, ``rather than give in to the bumper sticker-type humor that says <b> children </b> cause their <b> parents </b> to drink. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s important to understand that parental drinking patterns can later influence their children\\textbackslash{}'s drinking patterns,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Room said. The Florida researchers, under a grant from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked 120 <b> parents </b> with 5-to-12-year-old sons to interact with an unfamiliar boy of a similar age. The <b> parents </b> were then given an opportunity to drink as much or as little alcohol as they wanted, while anticipating a second interaction with the same child. Half of the <b> parents </b> in the study had difficult <b> children </b> of their own with short attention spans, hyperactivity, conduct disorders, or some combination of the three. The other half had only <b> children </b> without behavior disorders. But the researchers stacked the deck. Half the <b> parents </b> had initially interacted with boys who behaved normally, while half had faced boys trained by the researchers to behave in an overactive and disruptive way. Among <b> parents </b> of normal children, those who interacted with disruptive boys drank one-third more than those who interacted with a cooperative child. ``I feel justified in suggesting that these results indicate that drinking is a parental behavior that can be influenced by the characteristics and behaviors of children,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lang said. Parents with disruptive <b> children </b> at <b> home </b> responded differently to the study, however, depending on the drinking patterns of their own parents. Those who had a <b> family </b> history of drinking problems drank 50 percent more after interacting with a deviant child-actor, while those with no such <b> family </b> history drank less. ``This suggests that <b> people </b> differ in their vulnerability to increased drinking in response to the stress of interactions with a difficult child,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lang said. </p> 0.488623675412384  \\textbackslash{}n   Overweight <b> children </b> have greater long-term success controlling their weight if their <b> parents </b> provide early support for exercising and eating right, researchers said. Ten years after participating in a weight-loss program as 6- to 12-year-olds, <b> children </b> whose <b> parents </b> got similar weight-control training were significantly less obese than those whose <b> parents </b> received less training, according to a study published in Wednesday\\textbackslash{}'s Journal of the American Medical Association. ``We think the important finding is in the modeling,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said psychologist Leonard H. Epstein, head of the University of Pittsburgh\\textbackslash{}'s Childhood Obesity Clinic and leader of the research team. ``If you have <b> children </b> who you don\\textbackslash{}'t want to eat potato chips, you can\\textbackslash{}'t sit in front of them eating Ho-Hos.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Epstein\\textbackslash{}'s <b> group </b> also concluded that pre-adolescent weight loss had no effect on height development, contrary to the findings of several shorter-term studies. Two other childhood obesity experts called Epstein\\textbackslash{}'s results surprisin because previous research has shown that fat <b> children </b> will grow into fat adults and that weight lost in treatment programs is quickly regained. Those experts said further study was needed on whether treatment of obesity in childhood can produce effects that persist into young adulthood. In Epstein\\textbackslash{}'s project, an initial <b> group </b> of 75 obese <b> children </b> and their <b> parents </b> were randomly assigned to three groups. Study criteria required the <b> children </b> be more than 20 percent over ideal weight for their age, height and sex; both <b> parents </b> <b> living </b> at home, one of whom had to be obese; and one parent willing to attend treatment meetings with their child. All subjects were to attend eight weekly treatment meetings followed by six monthly meetings, then by 21-month, five-year and 10-year meetings. All were instructed to follow a regimen that included a 1,200-to-1,500-calorie-per-day diet and an aerobic exercise program. In the first group, both <b> parents </b> and <b> children </b> received reinforcement for losing weight and were trained to praise other <b> family </b> members for changing eating and exercise habits. In the second group, only the <b> children </b> received reinforcement for losing weight but were similarly trained to praise <b> family </b> members for weight-control behaviors. Parents and <b> children </b> in the third <b> group </b> received reinforcement only for attending the meetings. They received information about social reinforcement without specific training in how to use the method. All subjects lost weight initially. At the 10-year mark, the <b> children </b> in the first <b> group </b> were, on average, 7.5 percent less overweight than at the beginning of the study while those in the second and third groups were 4.5 percent and 14.3 percent fatter, respectively. Parents in all three groups were more obese after 10 years than at the start of the study. In a journal editorial, Dr. Albert J. Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania medical school and Dr. Robert I. Berkowitz of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic cautioned that the ``treatment did not prevent obesity, it limited it.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' They called Epstein\\textbackslash{}'s results surprising, perhaps because of his relatively small study sample: intact, middle-class <b> families </b> in which the <b> parents </b> were likely to be very supportive of their children\\textbackslash{}'s efforts.

Huddled inside were a mother and three children. They\\textbackslash{}'d lost almost everything \\_ including their home. They had blankets, beds, a few sticks of furniture and a hot plate, but no bathroom or refrigerator. No money either. Forced off their farm, abandoned by husband and father, the <b> family </b> was struggling to survive. Their predicament is a sad but increasingly common sign of hard times in the heartland. As farmers lose their land, small-town factories shut their doors and <b> housing </b> costs rise, growing numbers of <b> rural </b> folks are joining the ranks of the nation\\textbackslash{}'s homeless. ``Rural <b> homeless </b> <b> people </b> are everywhere around us,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Louisa Stark, president of the National Coalition for the Homeless. ``They\\textbackslash{}'re <b> living </b> in barns and chicken coops. They\\textbackslash{}'re doubled and tripled up with <b> families </b> and friends. They\\textbackslash{}'re <b> living </b> under trees or, in some cases, sleeping in caves.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Garages, too. The Iowa <b> family </b> had rented a nearby <b> house </b> after losing their farm last winter, but when the pipes burst and the landlord couldn\\textbackslash{}'t afford repairs, they moved into the garage because it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater. Shelly, who works for a farmers-assistance group, helped find them a place to stay. They moved on shortly after. People think <b> rural </b> America ``has been able to stand on its own two feet ever since the Depression,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Shelly said. ``(They think) somehow they\\textbackslash{}'ll get by. They think you have the white picket fence, mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids. That\\textbackslash{}'s not the way it is. ``The reality is <b> urban </b> life and <b> rural </b> life are not much different anymore,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she added. ``We have <b> people </b> going without food. We have <b> people </b> going without heat.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' And <b> people </b> going without roofs over their heads. Up to 3 million Americans are homeless, the national coalition says. Some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in <b> rural </b> areas, but nobody knows for sure because they aren\\textbackslash{}'t as conspicious as <b> people </b> panhandling on <b> city </b> streets or sleeping on grates. ``Everybody calls the <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> invisible. In fact, they are,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Melanie Roth of the Housing Assistance Council in Washington, D.C., which deals with <b> rural </b> low-income <b> housing </b> needs. ``They don\\textbackslash{}'t wander the streets of small-town America,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Keith Luebke, co-director of the Welcome Inn Transitional Living Center in Mankato, Minn. ``They leave or they somehow hide themselves or hide their problems. They don\\textbackslash{}'t want anyone to know.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Most of the newest <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> are working <b> poor </b> and farm families, says a report by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences. Compared with their <b> urban </b> counterparts, the report says, they\\textbackslash{}'re younger <b> families </b> dependent on two incomes; typically, one wage-earner loses a job and the remaining income isn\\textbackslash{}'t enough to pay the rent. They most often live in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled industries. These <b> people </b> face a Hobson\\textbackslash{}'s choice of moving in with friends or relatives \\_ or pulling up roots and leaving. The institute\\textbackslash{}'s report said some <b> rural </b> areas have a five-year waiting list for public housing. Though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities, the <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> get much less help \\_ fewer shelters, fewer soup kitchens, less money from charities. ``In short, the faint voice that has recently been given to the <b> homeless </b> in <b> urban </b> America has been denied the <b> homeless </b> of <b> rural </b> America,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said a national coalition study on such problems in Appalachia and the South. Several studies have examined <b> rural </b> homelessness. Among the findings: \\_ More than three-quarters of community agencies responding to a Housing Assistance Council survey last year reported increases in <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> from 1981-82 to 1986-87. Of those, 38 percent said the increase was significant. \\_ In Ohio, the proportion of women among the <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> was twice that of <b> urban </b> <b> homeless </b> populations, according to a 1985 study. That\\textbackslash{}'s partly due to the higher percentage of married <b> people </b> among the <b> rural </b> homeless, 18.5 percent against 6.7 percent married among <b> urban </b> homeless. \\_ In Minnesota, 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional <b> living </b> centers had jobs, compared with 24 percent in <b> urban </b> Minneapolis, said a 1988 study by the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless. \\_ In Iowa, a study found one of the larger groups in danger of losing <b> homes </b> was farm widows, many of whom live on just a few hundred dollars a month. The count of <b> rural </b> <b> homeless </b> should also include <b> people </b> who live in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family, a common arrangement among down-and-out farmers, the experts say. It may be 21 <b> people </b> <b> living </b> in one house, nine <b> children </b> and three adults squeezed in a trailer or a <b> family </b> so crowded they sleep in shifts. ``You have <b> people </b> <b> living </b> on top of each other. Those are the hidden homeless,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Luebke. ``These <b> people </b> no longer have their own <b> home </b> or apartment. They have a roof over their head, but in real terms they should be considered homeless.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies say it\\textbackslash{}'s tantamount to being homeless. ``When <b> people </b> have a <b> home </b> where the roof is constantly leaking and the cold air can come in ... (and) there\\textbackslash{}'s no money to fix those things, that\\textbackslash{}'s not a home,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Norma Dell, director of Bethany House, a Kentucky social service center. Agencies around the country have files on <b> people </b> <b> living </b> in rat-infested shanties, rotting houses without walls or shacks without heat, water or toilets. Others describe a wheelchair-bound man <b> living </b> under a bridge after being evicted, an Indian <b> family </b> sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough, a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator. Stark said she\\textbackslash{}'s heard reports from California of farmworkers <b> living </b> in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves. </p> 0.408340774464199  \\textbackslash{}n   Frustration over having to draw up an unemotional report on the <b> homeless </b> and then go into streets where <b> people </b> were ``ravaging garbage cans\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' prompted dissent by most of the report\\textbackslash{}'s authors, one of them said today. Phyllis Wolfe, executive director of a private health <b> care </b> program for the <b> homeless </b> in the nation\\textbackslash{}'s capital, said that while gathering information for the report, panel members became outraged at conditions they found. ``It could just not be left in dots and dashes and graphs and figures,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ms. Wolfe said on ``CBS This Morning.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ms. Wolfe joined eight other members of the committee formed by the National Academy of Sciences\\textbackslash{}' Institute of Medicine in issuing a supplementary statement that the institute refused to include in its report published Monday. The published report, ``Homelessness, Health and Human Needs,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' calls the growing number of <b> homeless </b> <b> children </b> ``a national disgrace.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' It recommends such measures as changing food stamp programs, increasing Medicaid services and expanding programs that help pre-school children. The authors of the supplementary statement said recommendations in the report were too limited. They said the country should supply more low-income housing, raise the minimum wage, offer more support services and guarantee <b> homeless </b> <b> people </b> adequate health care. Nine members of the 13-member panel signed the supplementary statement saying the main study ``fails to capture our sense of shame and anger about homelessness.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The original report estimates that <b> families </b> with a total of 100,000 <b> children </b> are <b> homeless </b> on any given night, in addition to countless <b> children </b> who have run away from <b> home </b> or been kicked out by their parents. It says those under 18 are the fastest growing <b> homeless </b> group, and homelessness is increasing in many <b> rural </b> areas as well as in the nation\\textbackslash{}'s cities. Ms. Wolfe said the committee\\textbackslash{}'s work on the report was ``very structured,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' but members found themselves ``leaving committee meetings and walking by and seeing <b> people </b> ravaging garbage cans, seeing <b> people </b> suffering on the street.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The supplementary statement itself expresses the same sentiment: ``We have reviewed the demographic and clinical data and then, walking home, passed men asleep on heating grates or displaced <b> people </b> energetically searching in garbage piles for a few cents\\textbackslash{}' income from aluminum cans,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' it says. ``We analyzed mortality data for the <b> homeless </b> but lacked any platform from which to shout that our neighbors are dying needlessly because we are incapable of providing the most basic services.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``We can no longer sit as spectators to the elderly <b> homeless </b> dying of hypothermia, to the <b> children </b> with blighted futures poisoned by lead in rat-infested dilapidated welfare hotels, to women raped, to old men beaten and robbed of their few possessions, and to pepole dying on the streets with catastrophic illness such as AIDS,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the supplementary report said. It said the committee members who dissented against the report\\textbackslash{}'s limited nature endorsed its long list of recommendations, but ``felt continuously uneasy because of our inability to state the most basic recommendation: homelessness in the United States is an inexcusable disgrace and must be eliminated.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.394652789863667  \\textbackslash{}n   Hours after three <b> homeless </b> <b> people </b> were evicted from one boarded-up <b> house </b> owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, they moved into another unoccupied HUD house, officials said. The three are members of the Union for the Homeless, and HUD spokesman Ken Barnard accused them of seeking publicity. Police evicted Clotilde Lewis, 36, Duwayne Jackson, 39, and Floretta Logan, 27, from the first <b> house </b> Tuesday afternoon. Homeless Union members had helped them break into the <b> home </b> on Saturday. Lewis was handcuffed and taken to a police station when she refused to leave the first <b> house </b> but was released without being charged. Barnard said the three were trespassing in a <b> house </b> bought by a <b> family </b> that planned to move in later in the week. Hours after their eviction, the three settled into a boarded-up four-bedroom <b> house </b> with three kerosene heaters, clothes and hamburgers from a fast-food restaurant. They remained there early today while officials considered whether to arrest them and file trespassing charges, said William Harris, deputy director of the Detroit HUD office. Wayne Pippin, president of the Union for the Homeless, said after the eviction Tuesday that HUD owns many vacant <b> homes </b> and ``should be ashamed to kick someone out of this home, which is needed so badly.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Jackson, unemployed after working at odd jobs, said <b> housing </b> is difficult to find on \\$150 a month from public assistance. ``This is a major emergency situation,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Sally Pattee, a <b> group </b> spokeswoman. ``The temporary shelters have been full since July.

The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the second largest of its kind ever upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. John V. Nielsen had operated an ARCO station as an independent dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station to a mini-market and self-service station in 1979. His lawsuit charged ARCO with fraudulently misrepresenting facts in connection with the conversion of his station. A <b> state </b> <b> court </b> jury awarded Nielsen \\$525,788 in compensatory damages \\_ \\$79,061 in out-of-pocket losses, \\$396,727 in lost anticipated profits and \\$50,000 for emotional distress. The jury also awarded him \\$3.5 million in punitive damages against ARCO. A <b> state </b> <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> upheld the award except for the emotional-distress damages, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear ARCO\\textbackslash{}'s appeal. In the <b> appeal </b> acted on today, <b> lawyers </b> for ARCO argued that the huge punitive-damages award \\_ seven times the compensatory-damages award \\_ violates the Eighth Amendment\\textbackslash{}'s ban on ``excessive fines.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' No <b> court </b> has ever applied that constitutional principle to non-criminal cases. The Supreme Court in May passed up deciding in a Mississippi <b> case </b> whether the constitutional ban on ``excessive fines\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' can be applied to personal-injury lawsuits. Some <b> state </b> legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury lawsuits. Lawyers for ARCO urged the justices to ``send a clear signal that the <b> state </b> <b> courts </b> must stop these gargantuan awards.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But <b> lawyers </b> for Nielsen argued that the ARCO <b> appeal </b> should not be granted because the oil company\\textbackslash{}'s <b> lawyers </b> had not raised the ``excessive fines\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' argument in <b> state </b> courts. The justices refused to address the punitive-damages issue in the Mississippi <b> case </b> decided earlier this month after noting that it had not been raised in <b> state </b> courts. ARCO\\textbackslash{}'s <b> appeal </b> did not challenge the \\$475,000 compensatory-damages award won by Nielsen.

The justices, without comment, let stand a <b> federal </b> <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> <b> ruling </b> that overturned a jury award against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the drug\\textbackslash{}'s manufacturer. Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Brock of Moscow, Texas, sued Merrell Dow after their daughter, Rachel, was born with deformed limbs in 1982. A three-member panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out the \\$550,000 judgment a <b> federal </b> trial jury had awarded the Brocks. The <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> said there is no definitive scientific proof that Bendectin causes birth defects, and said the jury award was based on speculation. ``Speculation unconfirmed by ... proof cannot form the basis for causation in a <b> court </b> of law,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> said. The full 5th Circuit court, by a 8-6 vote, refused to review the three-member panel\\textbackslash{}'s ruling. The dissenters noted that six experts testified for the Brocks that Bendectin is capable of causing birth defects, and that three testified they believed the drug caused Rachel\\textbackslash{}'s deformities. The dissenting judges said appellate <b> courts </b> should not substitute their understanding of the facts for that of a jury merely because medical experts disagree. Bendectin was marketed by Richardson-Merrell Inc. between 1957 and 1983. More than 30 million women used the drug during pregnancy. Richardson-Merrell later became Merrell Dow, which last July merged with Marion Laboratories Inc. and became Marion Merrell Dow Inc., based in Kansas City. The company stopped selling Bendectin 1983, although the Federal Drug Administration never has rescinded approval of it. Merrell Dow in 1984 agreed to pay \\$120 million to more than 800 families to compensate children with birth defects allegedly caused by Bendectin. As part of the settlement, the corporation did not admit that the drug caused the defects. The settlement was rejected by a <b> federal </b> <b> appeals </b> court, and the lawsuits then went to a consolidated trial in Ohio, where Merrell Dow has its headquarters in Hamilton County. After a 22-day trial in 1985, an Ohio jury found that Bendectin did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses. The <b> case </b> acted on today is Brock vs. Merrell Dow, 89-1189. </p> 0.525270540212575  \\textbackslash{}n   California\\textbackslash{}'s <b> civil </b> <b> rights </b> commission may not award damages for emotional distress or other personal harm caused by job discrimination, the <b> state </b> Supreme Court <b> ruled </b> today. The 5-2 <b> ruling </b> eliminates the Fair Employment and Housing Commission\\textbackslash{}'s ability to <b> order </b> damages for bias victims who commonly suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation caused by employers\\textbackslash{}' mistreatment. Those victims of sexual or racial harassment could still go to <b> court </b> and sue for a full range of damages. But suits are available only to those who can afford a lawyer. The <b> court </b> said the commission was authorized only to <b> order </b> back pay and reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require employers to take steps to prevent future discrimination. In a separate <b> decision </b> today, the <b> court </b> said discrimination victims were not required to file claims with the <b> state </b> before suing in court. The rulings come three years after the <b> court </b> prohibited the same commission from awarding punitive damages in flagrant <b> cases </b> of job discrimination. In that time, the Legislature has passed bills establishing the commission\\textbackslash{}'s authority to award both kinds of damages, but Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed them. Today\\textbackslash{}'s <b> ruling </b> was based on an interpretation of current <b> state </b> <b> law </b> and left open the possibility that the Legislature could pass a new <b> law </b> allowing the commission to award damages. But the opinion by Justice Edward Panelli hinted that unlimited damage awards by the commission, even if authorized by <b> state </b> law, might be found unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a jury trial. A jury in a <b> court </b> <b> case </b> ``is in the best position to determine just compensation for emotional and mental distress,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Panelli wrote. The <b> ruling </b> overturned a \\$20,000 damage award by the commission to Rose Brown, a secretary for the Peralta Community College District in Oakland. She claimed she was fired in April 1981 for refusing sexual advances by an administrator at Laney College. </p> 0.515448070132596  \\textbackslash{}n   The Supreme Court today strengthened the right of criminal suspects to have <b> lawyers </b> present when they are questioned by police. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned the murder conviction of Mississippi death row inmate Robert S. Minnick, who confessed when he was questioned without his <b> lawyer </b> present. The <b> court </b> said Minnick\\textbackslash{}'s <b> rights </b> were violated even though he earlier had consulted with his <b> lawyer </b> and agreed to talk to authorities. Unless the suspect initiates such a talk with police, the <b> court </b> said, he may not be questioned outside the presence of his <b> lawyer </b> once he has invoked his right to a lawyer. In other action, the court: - Left intact a lawsuit settlement that eased restrictions on abortion clinics in Illinois. The court, without comment, rejected an <b> appeal </b> by two nurses and two expectant fathers who said the settlement does not adequately protect women or fetuses. - Refused to kill a lawsuit against a California community college\\textbackslash{}'s officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the on-campus performance of a racially charged play. The court, without comment, rejected an <b> appeal </b> by the college officials. - Shielded businesses from some big-money lawsuits filed by employees who claim they were fired so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits. The <b> court </b> <b> ruled </b> unanimously that fired employees may not sue4 in <b> state </b> <b> courts </b> over such allegations. The <b> state </b> suits are pre-empted by a <b> federal </b> <b> law </b> protecting pensions, the <b> court </b> said. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the <b> court </b> in the confession case, said, ``There can be no doubt that the interrogation in question was initiated by the police. It was a formal interview which (Minnick) was compelled to attend.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Since (Minnick) made a specific request for counsel before the interview, the police-initiated interrogation was impermissible.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority was ``misguided\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to discourage ``an honest confession.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said the <b> ruling </b> undermines a ``belief in either personal responsibility or the moral claim of just government to obedience.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case. Minnick and James ``Monkey\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dyess escaped from Clarke County, Miss., jail in April 1986 and went looking for guns, authorities said. Police said the two men fatally shot Donald Ellis Thomas and Lamar Lafferty when the victims returned to Thomas\\textbackslash{}'s mobile home to find Minnick and Dyess there. Minnick was arrested in Lemon Grove, Calif., on Aug. 22, 1986. FBI agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a lawyer. Minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to answer any more questions. A few days later, Deputy Sheriff J.C. Denham of Clarke County flew to California and questioned Minnick. The suspect confessed, saying he shot Lafferty because Dyess was threatening to kill Minnick if he did not. Minnick was convicted in Mississippi and sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court, in upholding his conviction, said Denham\\textbackslash{}'s questioning of Minnick did not violate a rule the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1981. The high <b> court </b> barred police from questioning a suspect who has asked for a <b> lawyer </b> unless the suspect initiates the conversation. Today the high <b> court </b> extended that <b> ruling </b> to instances in which a suspect already has conferred with an attorney. Kennedy said the 1981 <b> ruling </b> is designed to prevent police from badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a <b> lawyer </b> provided by the court\\textbackslash{}'s famous Miranda <b> ruling </b> in 1966. The threat of badgering is no less after the suspect has talked to his lawyer, Kennedy said. ``A single consultation with an attorney does not remove the suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to waive his <b> rights </b> or from the coercive pressures that accompany custody and that may increase as custody is prolonged,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. The <b> case </b> is Minnick vs. Mississippi, 89-6332. </p> 0.509516901330661  \\textbackslash{}n   The Supreme Court today reinstated a \\$6.1 million award against the Arthur Young \\& Co. accounting firm won by investors in the Farmer\\textbackslash{}'s Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The justices, by a 5-4 vote, <b> ruled </b> that the promissory notes held by the co-op\\textbackslash{}'s investors are ``securities\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' as defined by <b> federal </b> law. A <b> federal </b> <b> appeals </b> <b> court </b> had thrown out the award after <b> ruling </b> that the notes were not securities. Sold for many years by the co-op to thousands of farmers, the notes were uninsured, payable on demand and yielded only interest. When the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984, about 1,600 of its 23,000 members held notes they had purchased for more than \\$10 million. Among other <b> legal </b> actions, investors filed a ``class action\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' lawsuit against Arthur Young \\& Co., which had audited the co-op\\textbackslash{}'s 1981 and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those statements. The suit alleged that the accounting firm fraudulently had misled investors about the co-op\\textbackslash{}'s financial strength, in violation of a <b> federal </b> security law\\textbackslash{}'s anti-fraud provisions. A <b> federal </b> jury awarded the investors about \\$6.1 million in compensatory damages, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award when <b> ruling </b> that the notes were not securities. In disagreeing with the 8th Circuit court, Justice Thurgood Marshall noted ``Congress\\textbackslash{}' broader purpose ... of ensuring that investments of all descriptions be regulated to prevent fraud and abuse.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R.

The <b> cocaine </b> seized in Monday\\textbackslash{}'s operation near Colombia\\textbackslash{}'s northern coast was hidden among cargo bags and ready to be exported to the United States, said regional army commander Col. Carlos Castro. He said troops destroyed six cocaine-processing laboratories, <b> arrested </b> 103 suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers and found nearly 5,000 acres of coca leaf, the raw material used to make cocaine. Soldiers also seized 30 vehicles, all with Venezuelan license plates, which had been used to transport drugs, Castro said. Also confiscated were cocaine- processing chemicals and a cache of weapons, he said. The bust was considered one of the year\\textbackslash{}'s most important. So far in 1990 security forces have confiscated about 45 tons of cocaine, compared to 33 tons in all of 1989. Colombia\\textbackslash{}'s Medellin and Cali <b> cocaine </b> cartels supply most of the <b> cocaine </b> consumed in the United States. The coca leaf is mostly grown in Bolivia and Peru, then processed in Colombia. The Medellin cartel has been blamed for a long series of terrorist attacks in which at least 550 people have died in the past 14 months. </p> 0.501531081379748  \\textbackslash{}n   Two suspected Colombian <b> drug </b> traffickers were extradited to the United States on Tuesday, the first such extraditions since President Cesar Gaviria took office last month. Jose Hilario Ortiz and Raul Hernan Buchelli, who both face <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> charges in the United States, were placed on board a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane bound for Miami, national police chief Gen. Miguel Gomez said in remarks broadcast by the RCN radio network. Ortiz faces <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> charges in Connecticut and Buchelli is wanted in Florida, said a police spokesman, requesting anonymity. No further details were immediately available. Buchelli is wanted on charges of conspiracy to smuggle and distribute heroin and money laundering, while Ortiz pleaded guilty to a <b> cocaine </b> <b> trafficking </b> conspiracy charge and fled the country before sentencing, according to U.S. court records. Buchelli\\textbackslash{}'s brother, Guido Lucio, also faces <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> charges in the United States. But he was released last week after the government rejected a U.S. request for his extradition, citing insufficient evidence. Colombia has extradited 24 suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers to the United States since August 1989, when the government launched a major anti-drug crackdown after the murder of a presidential candidate. Twelve of those extradited have either been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty; one was acquitted. An additional nine are awaiting trial. The crackdown prompted the Medellin <b> cocaine </b> cartel to declare ``total war\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on the government a year ago. Tuesday\\textbackslash{}'s extraditions were the first of suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers to the United States since Gaviria was inaugurated Aug. 7. He has pledged to continue the war against the <b> cocaine </b> cartels waged by his predecessor, Virgilio Barco. Last Wednesday, Gaviria modified the country\\textbackslash{}'s extradition policy. In a nationally televised speech, Gaviria said <b> drug </b> traffickers who turn themselves in and confess their crimes would be tried in Colombia and not face extradition to the United States. Under the decree announced by Gaviria, Colombian judges would be also empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess and cooperate with local investigations. The country\\textbackslash{}'s <b> drug </b> barons have so far offered no reply to Gaviria\\textbackslash{}'s offer. Gaviria\\textbackslash{}'s offer appeared to be, at least in part, a response to repeated offers from the <b> drug </b> traffickers to surrender to Colombian judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had been resumed last year by Barco. The <b> drug </b> traffickers have feared extradition to the United States because they would have little influence over the judicial process there. Cocaine cartel members have traditionally been able to either bribe or threaten their way out of Colombian jails. Judges who refuse to be intimidated have often been slain. In his speech last week, Gaviria announced that three Colombians would soon be extradited to the United States, but he said three other U.S. extradition requests had been turned down. The third suspect set to be extradited, Joaquin Oswaldo Gallo Chamorro, was still being held in Colombia on Tuesday. Authorities did not say why he was not sent to the United States with Ortiz and Buchelli. With the latest extraditions, the U.S. Justice Department is still seeking to extradite 14 suspected <b> drug </b> traffickers held in Colombia. Colombia\\textbackslash{}'s Cali and Medellin <b> drug </b> cartels supply most of the <b> cocaine </b> consumed in the United States and Europe. Authorities blame the Medellin for killing about 550 Colombians the past year, including three presidential candidates. </p> 0.440929319990765  \\textbackslash{}n   U.S. Postal inspectors <b> arrested </b> 10 employees for <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> through the Dallas Main Post Office Tuesday night, following a nine-month undercover investigation. Postal Inspector Jim Travell said <b> authorities </b> are still looking for two more employees who were indicted for selling and distributing marijuana and <b> cocaine </b> at the postal processing center. ``The indictments were handed down by a Dallas grand jury and charged each postal worker with selling <b> drugs </b> to <b> agents </b> who worked in an undercover capacity at the facility,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Travell, of Fort Worth. Sealed indictments were handed down April 28, Travell said, but they were not unsealed until Tuesday to allow <b> authorities </b> time to organize the arrests. Those <b> arrested </b> are mail handlers or processors and distribution clerks who worked two evening shifts processing mail through the Dallas facility, Travell said. ``They worked different shifts and we have no reason to believe there was a conspiracy between them,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Travell said. The employees, who have one to 10 years experience with the postal service, were <b> arrested </b> for selling between a quarter-ounce to several pounds of marijuana or between a half-gram to a quarter-ounce of <b> cocaine </b> in any one sale to the undercover officers, Travell said. ``The largest sale we did was \\$1,000,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Travell said. ``Most of them ranged from \\$25 to \\$1,000 a sale. The jist of the investigation was dealers, not users.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Webster of Dallas said the employees face pentalties of 5 years to 15 years in prison and fines of \\$150,000 to \\$200,000. Travell said inspectors were alerted to a <b> drug </b> <b> trafficking </b> problem among the 4,000 workers at the facility by employees. ``Fellow employees are starting to be fed-up with this type of behavior,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Travell said. </p> 0.440077480020122  \\textbackslash{}n   The prosecutor responsible for convicting reputed <b> cocaine </b> kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas says the powerful Medellin Cartel\\textbackslash{}'s days are now numbered, but a defense lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned. Lehder was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons of <b> cocaine </b> into the United States. Authorities say the 38-year-old Colombian was a key figure in the cartel, a violent <b> drug </b> ring responsible for about 80 percent of U.S. <b> cocaine </b> imports. The flamboyant Lehder, described by witnesses as a one-time New York City street hood, was characterized by U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, chief prosecutor in the case, as the most important <b> drug </b> smuggler brought to trial in the United States. The verdict capped a seven-month trial on an 11-count federal indictment charging him with taking over the island of Norman\\textbackslash{}'s Cay in the Bahamas to smuggle <b> cocaine </b> into Florida and Georgia from 1978 to 1980. </p> 0.399653013529052  \\textbackslash{}n   Police said Monday they have <b> arrested </b> a man in Hong Kong in connection with the seizure of 143 pounds of heroin concealed in cans of Chinese fruit imported to Los Angeles.

Evan Mecham broke the law and lied about it to the state Senate, a prosecutor said today in urging the Senate to convict the impeached first-term Republican and remove him from office. Prosecutor William French said in closing arguments that Mecham broke the law in borrowing \\$80,000 from the governor\\textbackslash{}'s protocol fund for his auto dealership. ``He has violated the law ... He has uttered untruths to you,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' French said. Earlier, prosecutor Paul Eckstein accused Mecham of showing ``a lifetime of reckless disregard for the reputation of anyne who has stood in his path to political power.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Respondent (Mecham) has demonstrated for all the world to see his plain inability to tell the truth,\\textbackslash{}' Eckstein said. ``How much proof is required to demonstrate that respondent puffed, exaggerated, misremembered, dissembled and out-and-out lied.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Eckstein said Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s conduct in <b> office </b> ``was not just offensive, it was grossly offensive.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Senators must decide whether to convict Mecham on two <b> impeachment </b> charges issued by the Arizona House. A third charge was dismissed. A vote could come late today or Tuesday, climaxing five weeks of trial, lawmakers said. A conviction would force the first-term Republican out of office. The first <b> impeachment </b> count accuses the <b> governor </b> of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death <b> threat </b> by a state official. Mecham contended he did not intend to beak the law and that he was not fully informed of the seriousness of the alleged threat. ``Ignorance of the law is no defense,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Eckstein told senators. But Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s defense lawyer, Fred Craft, told senators, ``You\\textbackslash{}'re being asked to politically assassinate the governor.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``He doesn\\textbackslash{}'t resign (as Mecham has been urged to) because he\\textbackslash{}'s not guilty of these charges,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Craft said. ``He dares to right city hall and he\\textbackslash{}'s doing it at great cost to himself.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Craft said in his closing argument that the allegation was based on a 90-second conversation with Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. Craft accused prosecutors of seeking to ``twist and torture it in such a way that it accounts for an obstruction of justice.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' As closing arguments proceeded, a trumpeter played ``Taps\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' outside the Senate building as a group of men carried a mock coffin labeled, ``Herein Lies the Right to an Elected Governor.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The prosecutor accused Mecham of making a number of statements during his Senate testimony that ``are either wrong\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' or were contradicted by other witnesses. Among the examples cited by Eckstein was the governor\\textbackslash{}'s testimony, recanted a day later, that his former chief bodyguard had stolen a report from the governor\\textbackslash{}'s office. Nonetheless, Eckstein said, Mecham and Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead gave ``remarkably similar\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' accounts of their Nov. 15 conversation in which Mecham allegedly ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general\\textbackslash{}'s investigation of the alleged threat. Mecham admitted in Senate testimony that he told Milstead, ``The attorney general is out to get me and I\\textbackslash{}'m not going to help him in any way.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mecham sat at the defense table during closing arguments. When he arrived at the Capitol, he was cheered by a group of well-wishers as he walked into the Senate building behind bodyguards. He said nothing but smiled and flashed a thumbs-up signal at the crowd. Mecham, 63, who took <b> office </b> in January 1987, has maintained he is innocent of wrongdoing. He also is accused of misusing \\$80,000 from the governor\\textbackslash{}'s protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. Last week the Senate dismissed a third charge that Mecham concealed a \\$350,000 campaign loan, the subject of the governor\\textbackslash{}'s April 21 criminal trial. Some <b> senators </b> said hearing testimony on that allegation could have prejudiced his criminal trial. However, Democrats acknowledged that the real reason they favored dismissing the charge was to ensure a Senate trial verdict well before the scheduled May 17 gubernatorial recall election. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required for conviction. Lawmakers also could bar Mecham from holding any future <b> public </b> office. If convicted, Mecham would become the seventh U.S. <b> governor </b> removed from <b> office </b> by impeachment. The prosecution contends the governor\\textbackslash{}'s protocol fund \\_ created with inaugural ball proceeds \\_ was a <b> public </b> fund and that Mecham Pontiac needed the \\$80,000 <b> loan </b> to meet its July 1987 payroll. However, the defense said the fund was private money and that the <b> loan </b> was intended merely to provide a higher interest rate for the fund. Mecham Pontiac was in good financial shape and could have borrowed the money elsewhere, according to testimony by the governor\\textbackslash{}'s son, Dennis, who is general manager of the dealership. But the day after he testified last week, Dennis Mecham announced the dealership was being sold. Sales had suffered due to the ``avalanche of negative publicity\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' about the governor, he said. The allegation regarding the death <b> threat </b> has boiled down to Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s word against that of Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. He testified that Mecham ordered him not to cooperate with the attorney general\\textbackslash{}'s investigation of the alleged <b> threat </b> by state official Lee Watkins against former top Mecham aide Donna Carlson. At the time of the alleged <b> threat </b> in November, Ms. Carlson was about to testify before the state grand jury regarding the \\$350,000 campaign loan. Senators, meanwhile, said they knew how important the <b> impeachment </b> vote will be. If the <b> governor </b> is allowed to return to his job, ``I think there\\textbackslash{}'ll be terrible chaos in state government,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat. Lawmakers\\textbackslash{}' own careers also may hang in the balance, some <b> senators </b> said. </p> 0.360770902047693  \\textbackslash{}n   Gov. Evan Mecham should be removed from <b> office </b> for obstructing an investigation of an alleged death threat, <b> senators </b> were told today during opening arguments of the first-term Republican\\textbackslash{}'s <b> impeachment </b> trial. But a defense attonrey for Mecham told <b> senators </b> in an impassioned statement that Mecham was the victim of a ``mutiny\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' by the state attorney general and director of the state Department of Public Safety. Prosecutor William French said the man accused of making the alleged threat, former state official Lee Watkins, had claimed that jobs in the Mecham administration ``relate to the amount of money that you were able to bring into the campaign.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' French said the evidence was ``overwhelming\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that Mecham violated criminal laws and his oath of <b> office </b> and committed malfeasance in office, ``any one of which call for impeachment.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' However, defense attorney Fred Craft told <b> senators </b> in his opening statement that Mecham broke no laws and was acting within his authority. ``What has this man done?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Craft said. ``There\\textbackslash{}'s something wrong in this state when you can depose the constitutionally elected officer of the state and throw the book at him ... based upon evidence that\\textbackslash{}'s being presented by people who have a stake in the outcome to have him ousted.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Craft said the accusations resulted from a ``mutiny\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' by Attorney General Bob Corbin and DPS Director Ralph Milstead. The DPS includes the Highway Patrol and investigative personnel. Craft also said he would present testimony that would cast dubt on Milstead\\textbackslash{}'s integrity. Mecham, who also faces a March 22 criminal trial and a May 17 recall election, did not appear at the Senate on the second day of his <b> impeachment </b> trial. The <b> impeachment </b> counts against Mecham include an allegation that he ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general\\textbackslash{}'s probe of an alleged death <b> threat </b> by Watkins, then the state prison construction chief. ``There was an obstruction with regard to an ongoing investigation that was being conducted by the attorney general\\textbackslash{}'s office,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' French said. Watkins has denied making a <b> threat </b> against Donna Carlson, a former top Mecham aide who testified before the state grand jury on Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s failure to report a \\$350,000 campaign loan. DPS Officer Frank Martinez, a former member of Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s security detail who was called as the trial\\textbackslash{}'s first witness, testified this morning that Mecham administration official Peggy Griffith told him about a conversation she had with Watkins. Ms. Griffith said Watkins had told her that if Ms. Carlson ``did not keep her mouth shut, she could wind up taking a long boat ride ... and I know the right people who can help me,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Martinez testified. Martinez said that he met with Milstead, other DPS officers, Corbin and several assistant attorneys general several days later and that Milstead told of a conversation he had with Mecham. Martinez said Milstead told the group that Mecham ``stated he didn\\textbackslash{}'t want him helping the attorney general.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``The overall mood was just amazement,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Martinez testified. Craft said Milstead and other officials did not fully advise Mecham about the alleged threat, adding that Milstead ``was a feckless employee of this state and he did not serve that <b> governor </b> well.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' French said Watkins complained about the job he was given by Mecham and told Corrections Director Sam Lewis, ``If they don\\textbackslash{}'t treat me right I can bring Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s administration down.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' French warned the Senate to ``keep your eye on the ball\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and not be distracted by any attacks on witnesses in the case. ``Know that this is being done because there is no defense,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' French said. The opening arguments today dealt only with the alleged threat. Arguments will precede discussion of the other allegations against Mecham as they are reached during the trial. On the trial\\textbackslash{}'s opening day Monday, the Senate strongly rejected efforts to dismiss <b> impeachment </b> charges against Mecham. Also, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule today on a defense claim that the <b> impeachment </b> trial, the first of a U.S. <b> governor </b> in 59 years, should be delayed until after Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s March 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a \\$350,000 campaign loan. The high court last week refused to grant a temporary delay, and Mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court if necessary. Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, said ``it was the first-day jitters for everyone\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in the <b> impeachment </b> trial\\textbackslash{}'s opening day Monday. ``It crosses everybody\\textbackslash{}'s mind \\_ the importance to do justice to the <b> governor </b> and the state,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, also a Republican. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s a large burden and we take it seriously.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Senators refused to dismiss the 23 articles of <b> impeachment </b> against Mecham, whose attorney, Jerris Leonard, entered an innocent plea on his behalf. On 11 separate motions, the largest number of the 29 <b> senators </b> voting for dismissal was seven. Several <b> senators </b> said the vote should not be considered an indication that Mecham is likely to be convicted, saying they want to hear the evidence first. However, Sen. Jeff Hill, a Republican who has strongly backed Mecham, said the governor\\textbackslash{}'s conviction was virtually a foregone conclusion. ``I think that it\\textbackslash{}'s not likely that he\\textbackslash{}'s going to prevail,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be removed from <b> office </b> and could be permanently barred from holding elective <b> office </b> in Arizona. Mecham, 63, won election in a three-way race after five tries. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and insisted he will survive both trials and a May 17 recall election and return to the <b> office </b> he gave up to acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, when he was impeached by the House on Feb. 5. </p> 0.342604915673256  \\textbackslash{}n   His governorship gone, his ailing auto dealership sold, Evan Mecham faces a future in which one of the few certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial. But for Arizona, the future looks brighter without the shadow of Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s embarrassing <b> impeachment </b> trial hanging over the state, said Rose Mofford, who became <b> governor </b> with Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s removal. ``Today we have reached the end of some difficult times in Arizona,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, said Monday. ``I know the decision made by the Senate today was not reached lightly. It is time to put all that behind us and move forward.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Today none of us are Republicans, none of us are Democrats,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. ``We are all Arizonans. Let us go forward together as Arizonans.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The impeached first-term Republican was stripped of his <b> office </b> Monday when the Senate convicted him of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death <b> threat </b> and misusing the governor\\textbackslash{}'s protocol fund. The end of the trial did not heal the divisions that arose during Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s turbulent 15 months in office. Predictably, the verdict was praised by Mecham opponents and condemned by supporters. Some legislators received police protection Monday night after getting threatening phone calls that were prompted by the vote, said Department of Public Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt. ``They\\textbackslash{}'ve been all types of intimidating-type threatening statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Schmidt said. Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s future troubles could include a maximum 22-year prison sentence if he is convicted on charges of concealing a \\$350,000 campaign loan. He faces trial April 21 in Maricopa County Superior Court on six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents. His brother Willard, who was his 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. The Senate threw out an <b> impeachment </b> count based on the \\$350,000 <b> loan </b> issue. Although the Senate did not bar Mecham from holding <b> public </b> <b> office </b> again, his lawyer, Jerris Leonard, indicated after the <b> impeachment </b> vote that Mecham may decide to bow out of politics. ``I think there is doubt,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said of whether Mecham would try to appeal his case to voters in a recall election May 17. It was not clear whether the ousted <b> governor </b> could remain on the recall ballot given him <b> impeachment </b> conviction. The matter probably will be decided by the courts, said Attorney General Bob Corbin. Leonard said, ``I think the decision of where we go from now is dependent on whether or not the <b> governor </b> himself wants to stay in politics and that\\textbackslash{}'s something that he\\textbackslash{}'s got to decide overnight.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' After Monday\\textbackslash{}'s conviction, Mecham left the Senate chamber smiling. Asked what he planned next, he said, ``We\\textbackslash{}'ll decide tomorrow or the next day ... We\\textbackslash{}'re keeping all our options open.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' After he was impeached by the House of Representatives on Feb. 5, the 63-year-old Mecham hinted he might give up politics. ``If I can be of service, fine,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``If not, I\\textbackslash{}'d enjoy private life. The best person doesn\\textbackslash{}'t always win. Politics is not my favorite pastime.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mecham ran for <b> governor </b> five times before being elected in 1986. Although Mecham\\textbackslash{}'s son, Dennis, testified last week that their Mecham Pontiac dealership in suburban Glendale was thriving, he announced a day later that they\\textbackslash{}'d been forced to sell it for \\$4 million because of dwindling sales. Dennis Mecham said bad publicity surrounding his father\\textbackslash{}'s political battles had driven customers away. The dealership was sold last week. </p> 0.339381693729968  \\textbackslash{}n   Skull and Bones, the oldest and most secret senior <b> society </b> at Yale University, boasts many distinguished alumni but none more prominent today than a ``spook\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' from the class of 1948 \\_ George Herbert Walker Bush. Little is known about the strange rituals and practices of the 156-year-old society, and that\\textbackslash{}'s the way its members want it. The rites are rumored to include placing initiates in a coffin and requiring them to plunge naked into a pile of mud. Some of the rumors come from rival societies, and may be suspect. No one but members really know what goes on inside the windowless, mausoleum-style structure of brown sandstone to which Bonesmen retreat. But as the Republican presidential nominee\\textbackslash{}'s own experience has shown, membership in the <b> society </b> forms powerful bonds of friendship that endure long after graduation. The vice president was one of 15 Yale juniors tapped for Skull and Bones in 1947. To this day, the Bonesmen who once heard him recount some of the innermost secrets of his life remain his good friends. Perhaps because of the pledge of secrecy that Bonesmen take, Bush did not mention his Skull and Bones membership in his autobiography, ``Looking Forward.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The <b> society </b> has long been suspected of ritualistic thefts. A group of history buffs in El Paso, Texas, claimed that the <b> skull </b> referred to in the society\\textbackslash{}'s name belongs to Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, whose grave was robbed in 1926. Endicott Davison, a lawyer who says he speaks for Skull and Bones, said the <b> society </b> does not have the skull. The former chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe in Arizona charged recently that Bush\\textbackslash{}'s father, Prescott Bush, stole the <b> skull </b> of Apache chief Geronimo years ago, and that it is still on display at Skull and Bones\\textbackslash{}' inner sanctum. That claim was denied by the vice president\\textbackslash{}'s brother, Jonathan Bush. One thing is not disputed: Bush the Bonesman is in powerful company. Brothers of the order have included Henry Stimson, Averell Harriman, Henry Luce, Potter Stewart, McGeorge Bundy, Archibald MacLeish, William F. Buckley Jr. and William Sloan Coffin Jr. Prescott Bush, a Republican senator from Connecticut, was a member. So was Bush\\textbackslash{}'s oldest son, George W. Bush, and about a half-dozen other family members. Skull and Bones is arguably the most famous and influential secret <b> society </b> in the United States, having served as a model for others that followed at Yale and other institutions. It was founded by William Russell, a member of the Yale Class of 1833, apparently in reaction to the stripping of secrecy from Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic society, during the rise of a national anti-secrecy movement. Skull and Bones is a private organization incorporated as the Russell Trust Association. It pays taxes to the city of New Haven and owns Deer Island, a resort on the St. Lawrence River. Giving Skull and Bones the benefit of the doubt, Brooks Mather Kelly, in a 1974 history of Yale, wrote of the society: ``Its purpose and programs were not revealed when it was founded and have never since been known. But that like most Yale societies it pretends to some intellectual and educational purpose can probably be assumed.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The <b> society </b> ``comes from a tradition of elitism of which Yale was at the center,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Dan A. Oren, author of ``Joining The Club,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' a book published in 1985 about the relationship between the university and Jews. Skull and Bones became the first of the secret societies to admit a Jew in 1937. During the 1960s, the <b> society </b> tapped a number of outspoken radicals. Even today, however, it remains steadfastly all-male. Of Yale\\textbackslash{}'s seven secret undergraduate societies, only one other \\_ Wolf\\textbackslash{}'s Head \\_ refuses to admit women. Having women as members would interfere with one of the ways Bonesmen become true brothers. By all accounts, Skull and Bones initiates must lay bare their souls, telling their sexual histories and life stories in graphic detail. ``The danger of secret societies and entering into the club world is it allows members to lose sight of the common folk who aren\\textbackslash{}'t part of the elite,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Oren said. But he said that Bush\\textbackslash{}'s experiences in World War II combat worked the other way. ``For so many veterans, their fight was against the racists and the bigoted values of Nazi Germany, so when they came back, they were embued with a strong sense of egalitarianism,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Oren said. Bush, 21 and already married, entered Yale in 1945 after his discharge from the Navy, which awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for his wartime exploits. While on one combat mission, Bush\\textbackslash{}'s plane was shot down and he was rescued by a submarine. Two fellow crewmen perished. Bush recounted his brush with death for Bonesmen in 1947 with great emotion, says former Rep. Thomas W.L. Ashley, D-Ohio, another member of the Bones class of 1948. ``What comes to mind was, he was an awful young guy who had had an idyllic kind of childhood who suddenly found himself in an airplane that was on fire facing a lot of death around him and almost certain death himself,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ashley said. Ashley and other Bonesmen in his Yale class are still close friends of Bush. ``Obviously, we became fond of each other,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ashley said. ``This was something kind of special to us.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He added: ``George Bush is exactly just as loyal to other friends as those who happened to be in the <b> society </b> with him. His friendship across the social range is known to everyone.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Members of the Bones class of 1948 came to Washington in 1981 for a reunion that included dinner at the vice president\\textbackslash{}'s mansion and a tour of the White House Oval Office. ``His having been a member of Skull and Bones and his continued involvement as an alumnus means he would probably be likely to draw upon past connections for the White House,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Oren said. ``But his choice of people \\_ James Baker III to be campaign manager, Dan Quayle as vice president \\_ shows he\\textbackslash{}'s willing to go beyond Yale,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Oren said. ``He has always maintained close connections to Skull and Bones, but his world certainly goes beyond New Haven.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.285543267407195  \\textbackslash{}n   A jury on Thursday convicted former U.S. Rep. Sam Steiger of theft by extortion for threatening a parole board member to get his vote on a personnel matter while serving in the Evan Mecham administration. ``Any time you go to court you can expect a guilty verdict, but it\\textbackslash{}'s difficult to believe,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Steiger said in the courtroom moments after the jury returned its verdict. Steiger, who was a top aide to the now-ousted Republican governor, was accused of threatening Ron Johnson, a member of the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. Steiger allegedly threatened to withhold permission for Johnson to work as a part-time Tempe justice of the peace and to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain as executive director Patricia Costello, a Mecham appointee. Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court scheduled a May 6 sentencing for the 59-year-old Steiger, who faces up to five years in prison. Asked whether the verdict would be appealed, defense attorney Thomas Karas said, ``We\\textbackslash{}'ll take it one step at a time.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Steiger said, ``That\\textbackslash{}'s up to counsel.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Jury foreman Greg Jones, a fire captain in suburban Mesa, said the deciding factor behind the verdict was ``the tapes of the phone call between Steiger and Johnson.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Johnson called Steiger at home from the <b> office </b> of the state attorney general, who taped the call. During testimony Monday, Steiger denied that he threatened Johnson or told him how he should vote. But the state alleged that Steiger followed up on the alleged <b> threat </b> in a letter and a telephone conversation after Johnson voted with the board majority to seek Ms. Costello\\textbackslash{}'s resignation. The board voted 4-3 that Ms. Costello should step down because of low staff morale. Steiger, a former five-term congressman, testified that he did suggest that Johnson should back Ms. Costello but denied that he tried to ``steal\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Johnson\\textbackslash{}'s vote by threatening his job. Karas had asked Reinstein to declare a mistrial, contending the conviction of Mecham at his state Senate <b> impeachment </b> trial Monday might prejudice jurors against Steiger. However, Reinstein ruled that great care had been taken to select unbiased jurors. Steiger gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  miles people damage area city water state town south north earthquake feet quake ground residents scale river buildings hit southern </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.81596056916631  \\textbackslash{}n   A small <b> earthquake </b> rattled central Utah early today, but there were no reports of <b> damage </b> or injury.

It was an aftershock of an earlier temblor. Initial reports of the <b> quake </b> came from Price, East Carbon and Helper. The quake\\textbackslash{}'s epicenter was 34 <b> miles </b> <b> south </b> of Price. The Carbon County sheriff\\textbackslash{}'s office said it received numerous calls, and the Emery County sheriff\\textbackslash{}'s office also received a few calls from <b> residents </b> asking about the earthquake. The central Utah <b> area </b> was <b> hit </b> by three quakes on Sunday, the largest of which was 5.6 on the Richter scale.

The Richter <b> scale </b> is a measure of <b> ground </b> motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 4.5 reflects an <b> earthquake </b> 10 times stronger than one of 3.5. An <b> earthquake </b> of 3.5 on the Richter <b> scale </b> can cause slight <b> damage </b> in a populated <b> area </b> and a 4 can cause moderate <b> damage </b> in the local area. </p> 0.772637586086353  \\textbackslash{}n   A moderate <b> earthquake </b> shook southeastern Alaska early today, but there were no immediate reports of <b> damage </b> or injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported.

The 1964 Good Friday <b> earthquake </b> in Alaska measured 8.5 on the Richter <b> scale </b> and was centered in Prince William Sound. It generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed at least 114 <b> people </b> as far <b> south </b> as Oregon and Hawaii. </p> 0.752233028146661  \\textbackslash{}n   A strong <b> earthquake </b> shook northern Taiwan on Sunday. Police said it unleashed rockslides that injured 13 people. They said the injured <b> people </b> were <b> hit </b> by falling rocks at three waterfall tourist sites in suburban Taipei. The quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, set off rock avalanches in an <b> area </b> covering 1,200 square yards, authorities said. The injured, who were all Taiwanese, were taken to a hospital, police said. One was reported to be in serious condition, and the others suffered only minor injuries. The Central Weather Bureau placed the epicenter of the early-afternoon <b> earthquake </b> in Sanchi, a coastal village about 10 <b> miles </b> <b> north </b> of Taipei.

A total of 10 aftershocks had been recorded following the first and strongest <b> earthquake </b> Friday evening, which registered 5.5 on the Richter scale, the Central Meteorological Agency said. No Richter readings were available for the aftershocks. All the quakes on Friday were centered at a depth of about three <b> miles </b> in western Niigata Prefecture along the coast of the Sea of Japan, it said. Police said the earthquakes caused a 75-foot section of a road to sink, set off 30 landslides, and created cracks in roads and the <b> ground </b> at 60 locations.

The Oklahoma Geological Survey said the <b> quake </b> registered 3.6 on the Richter <b> scale </b> of <b> ground </b> movement. A <b> quake </b> of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage. A <b> quake </b> of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. The National Weather Service said it had received reports of a tremor about 5:45 a.m. that was felt in Rush Springs, about 40 <b> miles </b> southwest of Oklahoma City, and Lindsay, about 28 <b> miles </b> <b> south </b> of Oklahoma City. The geological survey said the <b> quake </b> was centered 5 <b> miles </b> <b> north </b> of Lindsay. ``Police departments in those areas indicate that pictures fell from walls, objects were knocked off tables and out of cabinets and many <b> residents </b> were awakened,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the weather service said in a statement. Geological survey director Charles Mankin said earthquakes are common in Oklahoma, with a couple a week detected by sensitive seismographs. ``We rarely record them as high as 3.6,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``But a small <b> earthquake </b> in that <b> area </b> is not unusual.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Larry Thompson of KBLP radio in Lindsay said the station was flooded with calls after the tremor was felt. At the police department, dispatcher Lois Knapp said the shaking lasted about two seconds. ``This police department is cement and brick and rock, and it moved,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. There has been increased concern about a Midwestern <b> earthquake </b> since a New Mexico climatologist projected that there could be a major one in early December along the New Madrid Fault, which runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark. The projection, based on the fact that tidal forces will be particularly strong early next month, is disputed by most scientists. Mankin said there was no link between today\\textbackslash{}'s <b> quake </b> and the New Madrid Fault. ``Most of the earthquakes in Oklahoma we have not been able to relate to faults,`` Mankin said. ``They\\textbackslash{}'re very shallow earthquakes and we know they\\textbackslash{}'re from some <b> ground </b> adjustment, obviously, but we can\\textbackslash{}'t relate them to some fault.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In 1811-1812, a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the Richter <b> scale </b> struck the New Madrid Fault, ringing church bells in Washington, D.C., more than 850 <b> miles </b> away.

Yet many people are unaware that by establishing a sound <b> estate </b> plan they easily may shelter many holdings from probate. Still more don\\textbackslash{}'t know the principles behind assessing their estate. But by better understanding how the <b> federal </b> government governs <b> estate </b> taxes, people may avoid or reduce the future <b> federal </b> <b> tax </b> liabilities. This <b> tax </b> savings can preserve assets in the <b> estate </b> that otherwise might be used to <b> pay </b> death taxes. These assets then may be passed on to a spouse, children, or charity. There are several steps to take in evaluating your estate. First, determine the nature and the value of your estate\\textbackslash{}'s assets. Assts may include: your residence, other <b> property </b> such as a vacation home, household furnishings, savings bonds, stocks, checking and savings accounts, pension benefits, life <b> insurance </b> policies, automobiles. For <b> federal </b> <b> tax </b> purposes, there are several exceptions to determining the value of an asset: - For jointly owned assets held by spouses, only half the value of the asset is included in your <b> estate </b> if you are the first spouse to die. - For life <b> insurance </b> policies, the <b> amount </b> included in your <b> estate </b> is the face <b> amount </b> of the policy rather than its replacement cost or present cash value (if whole life) at the date of your death. - If you die before retirement, you receive none of your pension. However, half the value of the pension is payable to your spouse and half the vested plan <b> benefits </b> - what would have been available to you had you lived to retirement - are included in your gross estate. - Finally, Series EE bonds are included at their present value when they mature. - All other assets generally are included at fair market value. Second, determine your deductions when calculating <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> tax. Include funeral expenses, costs of the last illness of the decendent, if applicable; unpaid debts and mortgages; and administrative expenses for the estate. You\\textbackslash{}'ll incur fewer administrative expenses for assets transferred outside of the probate. To avoid probate, you may set up a living trust, although it will create some trust administration costs. In addition, <b> property </b> held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant outside the probate process. Other <b> property </b> of a contractual nature - such as life <b> insurance </b> policies or qualified pension plans - also will transfer to the beneficiary outside of probate. Step three, determine which <b> property </b> qualifies for the marital deduction or charitable deduction. Three factors make a difference: - If your will transfers <b> property </b> to your spouse, this <b> property </b> qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any <b> property </b> is held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the <b> property </b> passes to the surviving spouse and qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any life <b> insurance </b> or qualified pension plan names your spouse as policy beneficiary or plan benificiary, this, too, qualifies. The same kinds of arrangements will qualify <b> property </b> for the charitable <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> deduction if <b> property </b> is left to the charity as a result of a will, a specific <b> property </b> designation such as a joint tenancy, or a contractual benificiary designation. Any <b> property </b> qualifying for the marital deduction or the charitable deduction is not subject to <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability. Remaining <b> property </b> is referred to as the taxable estate. The fourth, and final, step is to determine estimated <b> federal </b> <b> tax </b> liability on the taxable estate. The unified <b> estate </b> and gift transfer <b> tax </b> rates apply to the taxable <b> estate </b> when calculating the <b> amount </b> of <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> tax. Every individual, regardless of the size of his or her estate, is entitled to a unified credit of \\$192,800 that absorbs, dollar for dollar, the <b> amount </b> of that individual\\textbackslash{}'s <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability up to that amount. This assumes that you did not make any lifetime gifts to an individual in any one <b> year </b> while alive that exceeded the <b> amount </b> of the gift <b> tax </b> annual exclusion <b> amount </b> of \\$10,000. Here, a rule of thumb applies. For your <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability to be greater than \\$192,800, your taxable <b> estate </b> must be greater than \\$600,000. As long as a husband and wife each hold \\$600,000 in separately owned assets, the couple can own a total of \\$1.2 million in assets and the entire <b> amount </b> for both estates avoids <b> federal </b> <b> estate </b> <b> tax </b> liability. The process of rearranging <b> property </b> ownership for <b> estate </b> assets, so that each spouse\\textbackslash{}'s <b> estate </b> takes maximum advantage is known as ``estate equalization.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Many people assume they won\\textbackslash{}'t have assets exceeding \\$600,000, but in these days of appreciated home values and sizable pension plans or life <b> insurance </b> policies, estates are often of surprising size. --- EDITOR\\textbackslash{}'S NOTE - Paul Lochray is an academic associate in the <b> estate </b> planning division of the College for Financial Planning in Denver. </p> 0.53898425780541  \\textbackslash{}n   The Internal Revenue Service said it is closing a loophole that allowed procrastinating <b> taxpayers </b> to slip out of the country briefly on April 15th and gain an automatic two-month extension on filing their <b> income </b> taxes.

The Internal Revenue Service said Monday it was granting special relief to farmers who did not receive Agriculture Department documents by the Feb. 15 scheduled date. Those documents are Form 1099-G, which reflects certain government payments, and Form 1099-A, on which acquisitions or abandonments of secured <b> property </b> are reported. Farmers generally are not subject to penalties for underpayments if they file their <b> returns </b> by March 1. The IRS concluded that farmers who failed to receive required information from the Agriculture Department by Feb. 15 might be unable to meet the March 1 deadline. The IRS said farmers affected by the delay should attach to their <b> tax </b> return a Form 2210F on which they have written their name and Social Security number and, on the bottom right, the words ``farm waiver.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' With the extension, farmers will have to file <b> returns </b> and <b> pay </b> any <b> tax </b> owed by April 15, the deadline for most taxpayers. </p> 0.453584332736209  \\textbackslash{}n   The government is losing billions of dollars in <b> tax </b> revenues each <b> year </b> because the Internal Revenue Service does not use an enforcement program on business <b> taxpayers </b> that it has been using effectively on individuals, a House panel said Monday. A report from the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between \\$3.2 billion and \\$8 billion a <b> year </b> in <b> taxes </b> on <b> interest </b> and dividends earned by businesses is never collected because the <b> income </b> is not reported to the IRS. While the <b> revenue </b> loss estimates ``are not statistically precise,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the report said they provide ample justification for the IRS to include businesses in the document-matching program it now uses to verify <b> interest </b> and dividend earnings on individual <b> tax </b> returns. Under the existing document-matching program, the IRS compares ``information returns\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' detailing <b> interest </b> and dividend <b> payments </b> to individuals with the individuals\\textbackslash{}' actual <b> income </b> <b> tax </b> returns. The program in fiscal 1985 produced \\$2.35 billion in additional <b> tax </b> <b> revenue </b> from individuals. Although banks and corporations are not required to file such information <b> returns </b> on <b> income </b> <b> payments </b> to corporations, the House report said the IRS received \\_ but never used \\_ 26 million such <b> returns </b> in 1985, showing <b> income </b> <b> payments </b> to 5 million businesses totaling \\$987 billion. ``By casting these information <b> returns </b> aside, IRS is not only missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported business <b> tax </b> liabilities but has created a double standard of enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than individuals,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee. IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday the agency has not seen the House report and will have no comment until agecny officials can review it. But at a hearing before Barnard\\textbackslash{}'s subcommittee last year, IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said the costs of implementing a document-matching program for corporations would not be justified by the additional <b> revenue </b> that would be generated. Gibbs said the administrative costs of a document-matching program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different names. Although the problems cited by Gibbs all ``pertain to the way <b> income </b> is reported\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to the IRS, the House report said the IRS ``never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial document-matching program encompassing those corporations to which the difficulties do not pertain.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gibbs told the subcommittee last <b> year </b> the IRS would begin using document-matching to verify <b> income </b> reported on <b> tax </b> <b> returns </b> from single-owner businesses and would initiate a multi-year study to determine the extent of business underreporting of <b> interest </b> and dividend income. He also promised to begin a test program using information <b> returns </b> to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file any <b> income </b> <b> tax </b> return. The House report said the test program in one district office was so effective the IRS now has expanded it to nine more districts and could have a document-matching program ready by next spring to identify non-filers among corporations and partnerships nationwide. But despite such efforts, Barnard said the IRS ``has not been sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated computer matching capabilities to businesses.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and every one of their <b> returns </b> will be scrutinized by IRS\\textbackslash{}' computers for unreported <b> income </b> deserve to know why corporate and partnership <b> returns </b> are being excused from this automatic examination process,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Barnard said. The report said Congress should help the IRS set up a document-matching program for corporate <b> returns </b> by enacting legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions report to the IRS all dividend and <b> interest </b> <b> payments </b> to corporations. Barnard introduced such legislation earlier this year, but it was never reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee. </p> 0.424224737025707  \\textbackslash{}n   Social Security officials say a quadriplegic who won a seat in the Legislature has been warned he could lose his medical <b> benefits </b> if he takes his newly won seat and begins drawing expense reimbursements. Bill Boharski, a Kalispell Republican, defeated Democrat Gordon Hall in November, to win his first term in the Montana House. But after drawing expense reimbursements for attending legislative caucuses in November, Boharski said he was notified the reimbursements were ``unearned income\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that would make him ineligible for continued medical <b> benefits </b> under Medicare and Medicaid. And Boharski, who is paralyzed from injuries he suffered in an automobile accident five years ago, says he can\\textbackslash{}'t afford to lose the money. He estimates his medical expenses at \\$15,000 a year. ``That put me in a position where I had to seriously consider whether or not I had to resign my position,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the 27-year-old legislator-elect said. ``That <b> amount </b> of medical bills isn\\textbackslash{}'t something you can just pay.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Boharski said the situation is not desperate because state and <b> federal </b> officials are trying to help. Legislative leaders say they\\textbackslash{}'re considering a change in state compensation law to redefine the reimbursements, and Boharski said Social Security has advised him the case is under review. Boharski also said he will ask Congress for help if need be. Montana legislators earn \\$52.13 for each working day in the session plus \\$50 a day during the session as reimbursement for living expenses in Helena. The 1989 session begins Monday. It\\textbackslash{}'s the expense reimbursement that concerns Social Security Administration officials. Mark Fredenberg, operations supervisor for the agency\\textbackslash{}'s Kalispell office, said that under <b> federal </b> law, the expense allowances are considered unearned income. Social Security disability <b> benefits </b> are reduced by the <b> amount </b> of unearned <b> income </b> over \\$20 that a person receives, he said. And a person who loses eligibility for those <b> payments </b> because of unearned <b> income </b> also loses eligibility for medical coverage, he said. Most people receiving disability <b> payments </b> don\\textbackslash{}'t work or don\\textbackslash{}'t travel to work, Fredenberg noted, saying a situation such as Boharski\\textbackslash{}'s arises ``very, very seldom.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Boharski said he checked into the <b> federal </b> regulations before he filed for office last spring. He said he was told then he would qualify for continued medical <b> benefits </b> if elected, under a program that allows people to continue receiving medical coverage even if they are working. Boharski said Social Security officials have since told him he should be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. But, he said, he hasn\\textbackslash{}'t yet received written verification. Fredenberg said he could not comment directly on Boharski\\textbackslash{}'s case because of <b> federal </b> privacy laws. Boharski said if legislation at the state level doesn\\textbackslash{}'t resolve the problem, he will try to have changes made at the <b> federal </b> level so he can retain his legislative seat. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m counting on staying,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``Anyone who knows me knows I don\\textbackslash{}'t quit that easy.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  killed army troops guerrillas forces attacks fighting security northern rebels soldiers wounded beirut military ireland bomb terrorist bombing ira responsibility </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.635865970826442  \\textbackslash{}n   Rival Christian <b> forces </b> today used a cease-fire to stockpile weapons and redeploy <b> troops </b> for their next battle, while civilians fled their ruined neighborhoods for refuge in safer Moslem areas. Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia, refused to give any concessions to Gen. Michel Aoun and said his fighters were ready for war. A source close to Geagea\\textbackslash{}'s command said his militia had adopted a new <b> military </b> plan to block any attempt by Aoun to storm its strongholds if the current cease-fire collapses. ``If clashes break out anew, it will be a tough, crushing battle throughout the Christian enclave,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the source said.

The dead include 97 <b> soldiers </b> <b> killed </b> since the confrontation broke out Jan. 30. The <b> fighting </b> began when Geagea refused Aoun\\textbackslash{}'s demand that he disband the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia in Lebanon. Geagea\\textbackslash{}'s 6,000-strong militia has deployed about one-third of its fighters in east Beirut, the <b> military </b> source said. They are to defend its urban strongholds and deny Aoun access to the port through the streets of the Ashrafiyeh district. Aoun lost the port in the early days of the fighting. Military analysts believe Aoun must regain control of the port to ensure safe supply lines by sea before accepting any peace settlement. The Lebanese Forces moved new heavy fire power into place in the Kesrouan mountains to harass Aoun\\textbackslash{}'s back if he tries to move into the port area, the source said. The upgraded fire power includes about 120 truck-mounted multi-barreled rocket launchers brought out of weapons depots. The launchers, obtained from Iraq more than a year ago, can fire 40 122mm shells a minute. Geagea\\textbackslash{}'s men are outnumbered by Aoun\\textbackslash{}'s <b> army </b> at least 3-to-1 and hoped to counter his superiority with their upgraded weapons, the source said. Lebanese <b> forces </b> militiamen, with nearly 15 years\\textbackslash{}' experience in street battles, ``are waiting for Aoun\\textbackslash{}'s <b> army </b> in the narrow alleys of Ashrafiyeh, which has become a huge garrison,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the source said. The militia force defending the port, Ashrafiyeh and the <b> military </b> headquarters of Karantina have been beefed up from 1,200 to 2,000 men, the source said. The surrender of Aoun\\textbackslash{}'s <b> troops </b> Saturday at Adma, an isolated pocket in Kesrouan, freed the militiamen for the new deployment. The source said the bulk of the militia\\textbackslash{}'s <b> fighting </b> force, backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers, was deployed along the southern and eastern edges of Kesrouan province, separated from Aoun\\textbackslash{}'s <b> troops </b> by a no-man\\textbackslash{}'s-land of just a few hundred yards. A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations, confirmed that both factions were bolstering their forces. Aoun\\textbackslash{}'s <b> army </b> stockpiled ammunition, especially tank cannon and howitzer rounds, in depots in the Metin mountains northeast of the capital. Meanwhile, civilians continued to desert the Christian enclave, seeking refuge in the predominately Moslem areas outside the enclave. The Christian communities, dispersed throughout Lebanon before the civil war, have gradually consolidated in the enclave since 1975. </p> 0.59707854563647  \\textbackslash{}n   Christian and Moslem militiamen today exchanged mortar fire across Beirut\\textbackslash{}'s dividing Green Line. No casualties were reported. The two-hour battle in downtown Beirut came amid reports of growing tension between a Christian militia and the Lebanese army. There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth between civil war antagonists in Beirut in two weeks. The clashes have strained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975. The <b> fighting </b> coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians\\textbackslash{}' main militia, in east Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital. Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all over the Christian sector of Beirut and along the main coastal highway running north from the city, witnesses reported. Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons searched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But the Christian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension between the militia and the Lebanese army, which is controlled by Christian officers. The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexing show to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army. The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. Michel Aoun, has been quoted by several Beirut newspapers recently as saying the <b> military </b> could finish off the militia any time it wanted. Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by the Maronite Catholic commander to become the next president of Lebanon after President Amin Gemayel\\textbackslash{}'s six-year term expires in September. Aoun, who has not denied the statements, has not offically proclaimed his candidacy. </p> 0.575284714154695  \\textbackslash{}n   Israeli-backed Christian militiamen shelled a U.N.-policed vilage in south Lebanon today, wounding an Irish peacekeeper, three Lebanese women and an 8-year-old boy. Timur Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, said the Irishman was injured in the head when a 60mm mortar round crashed into one of the Irish battalion posts in Qabrikha, 18 miles east of Tyre. He declined to give the Irishman\\textbackslash{}'s name. Lebanese police later said four villagers, including three women and a boy, also were <b> wounded </b> in the bombardment. Police said the South Lebanon Army militia opened up on the Shiite Moslem village after a roadside <b> bomb </b> exploded in the village of Qantara, in Israel\\textbackslash{}'s self-designated securitu zone in south Lebanon. It as not clear whether anyone was hurt in the explosion. The 2,000-man militia patrols the 6-to-10-mile deep <b> security </b> zone jointly with Israeli troops. The buffer was established after Israel withdrew the bulk of its occupation force from south Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year invasion. </p> 0.574702319084469  \\textbackslash{}n   Rebels said Friday they had overrun three more government garrisons in southern Sudan and beaten back a <b> military </b> convoy trying to stage a rescue mission.

No one immediately claimed <b> responsibility </b> for Thursday night\\textbackslash{}'s failed attack but a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabular said the Irish Republican Army was suspected. The RUC spokesman said armed, masked men kidnapped a man from his home near Newtown Butler and ordered him to drive a truck containing a 3,500-pound <b> bomb </b> to an <b> army </b> checkpoint at Annaghmartin. The gang tied up the man\\textbackslash{}'s elderly parents and locked them in a bathroom while the man was driven near the checkpoint, 56 miles southwest of Belfast. The man was told to deliver the bomb, which they said had a five-minute timer, police said. The man drove the red pickup to the checkpoint, jumped out and shouted a warning. A short time later there was a small explosion, which was believed to have been caused by the detonator going off, police said. Army <b> bomb </b> experts defused the bomb, one of the largest ever found in Northern Ireland, police said. The <b> army </b> said there was only minimal damage and no one was injured. On Oct. 24, the IRA staged three human <b> bomb </b> <b> attacks </b> which <b> killed </b> six <b> soldiers </b> and a civilian, who drove one of the bombs to the <b> army </b> targets.

Reagan\\textbackslash{}'s shadow has already shortened for Bush. These days he is seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the president. Instead, the questions now center on whether his candidacy is exerting too much influence over the Reagan White House. Both Bush and Reagan in recent days have fended off suggestions that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort to help the Bush campaign. And confronted with public opinion polls showing Bush far behind among Democrats who voted for Reagan, Bush advisers have now switched strategy to make sure that the Reagan shadow doesn\\textbackslash{}'t disappear altogether. After first planning no contact at the Republican National Convention between Reagan and his <b> vice </b> president, a joint rally is now scheduled for Tuesday in New Orleans. It follows an upbeat joint appearance between Reagan and Bush at a rally last Friday for senior <b> administration </b> officials at the Old Executive Office Building, during which Reagan lavished praise on his <b> vice </b> president. If all goes as planned, Bush\\textbackslash{}'s transformation into his own man will be complete when he accepts the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, according to aides and GOP consultants. By the end of the convention, ``all the emphasis is going to be on George Bush and his <b> vice </b> presidential nominee,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said his chief of staff, Craig Fuller. Lee Atwater, Bush\\textbackslash{}'s campaign manager, said that Bush ``has made a conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to the president.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``And now that he\\textbackslash{}'s running for the <b> president </b> himself, he\\textbackslash{}'s talking about how he feels, what he believes in, and where he wants to take the country,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Atwater said. To be sure, there are some areas in which Bush does not want to put much light between himself and Reagan \\_ largely the current <b> economic </b> expansion, now in a peacetime record of 69 months, and the fact that most of the world is at peace. The <b> vice </b> <b> president </b> has been inching away from his close identification with <b> administration </b> policies since he and aides huddled for a week in late May at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine. The consensus from his advisers was near-unanimous: he had to do more to establish his own agenda. Since then, Bush has hinted that he would be more aggressive in dealing with the Soviets, would enforce civil-rights laws more vigorously, would spend more on education and do more to clean up the environment than the <b> president </b> he has served for the past 7\\{ years. He has also proposed many of his own initiatives, including a \\$2.2 billion child care program, a ban on offshore ocean dumping, and a reorganizaton of the anti-drug effort under the <b> office </b> of <b> vice </b> president. He also has proposed a new White House ethics <b> office </b> and a ``flexible freeze\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on federal spending. But most of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s moves away from the <b> administration </b> have been cautious, for fear of appearing disloyal. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m not going to change just to emerge from a shadow,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he has said. In a recent interview, Bush said he will differ with Reagan when he feels he has a different set of goals. ``I have every intention of saying, here is what we\\textbackslash{}'ve done and and here are my priorities. ``But I\\textbackslash{}'m not doing that to quote distance myself, to show my own identity,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he continued. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m doing it to say, look, here is what we\\textbackslash{}'ve done. Here are the successes, and here are the shortcomings, and here\\textbackslash{}'s what George Bush will do.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Still, Bush\\textbackslash{}'s close identification with the <b> administration </b> continues to pose problems for him as Democrats keep driving home their ``Where is George?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' slogan. When the general election campaign heats up after Labor Day, Bush is expected to be hit repeatedly by Democrats for his role \\_ still vague \\_ in some of the less popular Reagan <b> administration </b> decisions, including arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran and past support for Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Meanwhile, the impact of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s candidacy has already been seen in a number of recent presidential decisions \\_ including Reagan\\textbackslash{}'s selection last week of a Hispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to be education <b> secretary </b> \\_ fulfilling in advance a Bush campaign pledge. Reagan filled two other Cabinet vacancies with people on close terms with Bush, naming former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh to succeed Edwin Meese as attorney general and Wall Street investment banker Nicholas F. Brady to follow James A. Baker III as treasury secretary. Baker resigned to run Bush\\textbackslash{}'s campaign. The <b> president </b> also yielded to Bush\\textbackslash{}'s urgings in deciding to allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in the president\\textbackslash{}'s veto of a \\$299.5 billion defense authorization bill. Reagan also has picked up on some of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s campaign themes, including advocating the death penalty for ``drug kingpins.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t think it\\textbackslash{}'s as much a matter of Bush disagreeing or separating himself from Reagan as much as demonstrating that his agenda is a little different,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said GOP consultant Charlie Black, who is a Bush convention adviser. And John Sears, another Republican consultant, said: ``The real moment of truth is when Bush accepts the nomination.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``He can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of the Reagan <b> administration </b> have brought to the country. And he can prove himself presidential. In his acceptance speech, he can do it all,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sears said. </p> 0.343152635790944  \\textbackslash{}n   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Thank you. Thank you very much. Theresa. You\\textbackslash{}'re an outstanding member of the North Carolina Legislature, and I know that you\\textbackslash{}'re going to have a resounding re-election victory in November. Thank you so much. Peace, progress, opportunity. That\\textbackslash{}'s what we\\textbackslash{}'re here to celebrate. That\\textbackslash{}'s the legacy of a great president, Ronald Reagan. And that will be the living legacy of the next <b> president </b> of the United States, George Bush. First, let me thank the Democratic Party <b> leaders </b> for televising their Convention. What I saw and heard reminded me and millions of other former Democrats why we\\textbackslash{}'re proud to be Republicans. The Dukakis convention speech was just like the Democrat platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on spending. We\\textbackslash{}'re not running against Bentsen and Dukakis, we\\textbackslash{}'re running against Bentsen and Hedges. ``Governor Hedges,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Governor Hedges,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Governor Hedges\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' tried mightily to paint over his liberal policies with pretty rhetoric. But the make-up job failed. As an old federal trade commissioner, I want to know -- whatever happened to truth in advertising? But we\\textbackslash{}'ve come to New Orleans not to pin the tail on the donkey. We\\textbackslash{}'re here to pin our hopes on the American future. And we\\textbackslash{}'re not buying the Dukakis deception. Despite what he says, this election is about ideas and ideology. They do matter. They will matter to Americans who face a choice this year as stark and dramatic as any in memory. We Americans faced a similar choice in 1980. And what did we get for our choice? We got a <b> president </b> who doesn\\textbackslash{}'t apologize for American interests \\_ he asserts them. We got a breakthrough in Soviet relations and the INF treaty. We got the longest <b> economic </b> boom in peacetime history. It was my privilege for seven years to serve the man who made this happen \\_ one of America\\textbackslash{}'s greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, for that opportunity. Today\\textbackslash{}'s strong economy means stronger families. And we affirm the woman who chooses to work in the home. But our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions of women, and let me say to the women of America: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also ask you to have an open mind. You know better then anyone that a job \\_ a good job \\_ is absolutely basic to a family\\textbackslash{}'s happiness and stability. That\\textbackslash{}'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}') In the past eight years, President Reagan has created an incredible jobs machine \\_ more jobs for more Americans than ever before. And two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs created since 1982 went to women. Good jobs, not bad jobs. Real work, not make work. That\\textbackslash{}'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}') You did it. You were the expansion. You, the women of America \\_ who are holding jobs as never before, who\\textbackslash{}'ve started businesses as never before, who have invested as never before. This expansion \\_ it\\textbackslash{}'s your triumph. But it was Ronald Reagan and George Bush who set in motion the forces which allowed that growth to occur and the economy to bloom. That\\textbackslash{}'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}') America is on a roll. If this great <b> economic </b> upsurge is stopped, if we have a President who raises taxes again and in creases regulation again and stifles growth again \\_ and believe me, that\\textbackslash{}'s what Michael Dukakis will do \\_ if we let the liberals back in, we lose all that progress \\_ your progress. </p> 0.331933696413048  \\textbackslash{}n   American officials plan to file a formal protest over Swiss security officers who jabbed a U.S. diplomat with a machine gun and roughed up a news photographer traveling with President Bush in Geneva. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s so strange - supposedly a peace-loving nation gave us the most vicious treatment I\\textbackslash{}'ve ever seen,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' White House press <b> secretary </b> Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One en route home from Switzerland. Fitzwater said the U.S. government would file a formal protest over a number of incidents that occurred when Bush arrived in Geneva for a three-hour stop and again on departure. He also said White House chief of staff John Sununu was ``verbally attacked\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' when he complained. ``I\\textbackslash{}'ve never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a security force in the last 10 years,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Fitzwater said. American chief of protocol Joseph Reed was poked in the abdomen with a machine gun in one of the airport incidents. Fitzwater said Reed would summon Swiss Ambassador Edouard Brunner and lodge a formal protest next week after Bush returns from a trip to Mexico. ``They pulled a machine gun on Ambassador Reed ... and verbally attacked the chief of staff (Sununu),\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Fitzwater said. Officers clashed with newsmen and photographers in the president\\textbackslash{}'s party on arrival in Geneva, pushing and shoving them as they sought to approach the ramp on which Bush would leave the plane. Fitzwater said that at a hotel in Geneva later Sununu brought up the airport incident with the chief of security. He said Sununu was met with verbal abuse. Guards lined up shoulder to shoulder prevented reporters and photographers from approaching the president\\textbackslash{}'s ramp on departure. No one could see Bush at the base of the ramp, though he and Mrs. Bush were visible when they climbed the ramp to board the aircraft. White House press aides tried to get the Swiss officers to move out of the way, and a shouting match followed. It was then that Jerome Delay, a Washington-based photographer for the French news agency Agence France-Presse, was roughed up and the machine gun shoved into Reed\\textbackslash{}'s abdomen, Fitzwater said. Reed was trying to reboard the plane, Fitzwater said. There was no immediate word on whether Delay was hurt. The Washington bureau of the news agency said it had no word of any injuries. Fitzwater said he had not discussed the incident with Bush. There was no answer at the Swiss embassy in Washington Friday night. No separate number is listed for the ambassador. </p> 0.312993868213452  \\textbackslash{}n   The emerging Bush <b> administration </b> includes prominent holdovers from the Reagan years, but with one clear and important difference: The new team is tilted far more toward pragmatists than ideologues. Bush filled three more key positions Monday and his choices were sure to set off cries of anguish from the right. Dick Thornburgh will remain attorney general and Lauro Cavazos will stay on as education secretary. Both men were late-comers to the Reagan <b> administration </b> and both replaced leading ideologues, Edwin Meese III and William Bennett. The third Bush choice was Richard Darman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget. ``He\\textbackslash{}'s put together an Eastern establishment Republican administration,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said conservative activist Richard Viguerie. ``That\\textbackslash{}'s discouraging.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' High-profile jobs in the next <b> administration </b> are rapidly being filled, and only one Bush choice has drawn applause from conservatives \\_ Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire who will serve as White House chief of staff. The voting machines had hardly stopped humming with Bush\\textbackslash{}'s 40-state Election Day victory when the president-elect made the most obvious choice for his new <b> administration </b> \\_ friend, adviser and campaign chairman James A. Baker III to succeed George Shultz as <b> secretary </b> of state. During his tenure as White House chief of staff Baker earned a reputation as a quintessential pragmatist, a savvy insider who repeatedly gave low priority to the initiatives of the more ideological elements in the Reagan administration. Calls on Reagan to fire Baker were always sure applause lines at conservative gatherings. Baker\\textbackslash{}'s deputy was Darman. Quick to follow the Baker selection was that of another old Bush friend and adviser, Nicholas Brady. He will remain treasury secretary. In fact, another characteristic of the Bush appointees is how many have long-standing ties to the president-elect. When Ronald Reagan was filling out his <b> administration </b> eight years ago, he was meeting many of the top officials for the first time. The same was true of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. Not so with Bush. His relationships with the people he has appointed goes back many years. That should not be surprising, considering the years Bush has served in governmental and party posts. The long resume he touted during the presidential campaign put him in close contact with other up-and-coming Republicans. No one ever described Bush as an ideologue and, clearly, the people he feels most comfortable with are as pragmatic as he. It\\textbackslash{}'s always tough to get the jump on a new <b> president </b> and name his Cabinet for him. But so far there have been no big surprises, no choices from other than the names subject to the most speculation. The names being mentioned for the remaining national security jobs are former Texas Sen. John Tower for Defense and Brent Scowcroft for national security adviser or CIA director. Scowcroft was national security adviser to President Ford and is an establishment figure. One conservative favorite whose name is frequently mentioned for a Cabinet post is former New York Rep. Jack Kemp. But Kemp is most often mentioned as either Labor or Housing secretary, the two areas where he is least-stringently ideological. The former Buffalo congressman has always enjoyed good relations with traditionally Democratic unions and his major urban initiative is a proposal for enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate in neighborhoods with high unemployment. Neither post would make Kemp a major player in areas where his more ideological views on monetary and tax policy would have influence. Bush may yet come up with some appointees who will please hard-line conservatives, but there is no sign of a Bennett, a James Watt or a Donald Hodel waiting in the wings. </p> 0.288170522493812  \\textbackslash{}n   President Bush complained testily Thursday about news accounts which he said portrayed him as deceptive, declaring he would hold fewer news conferences and initiate a ``new approach\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' toward reporters. ``From now on, it\\textbackslash{}'s going to be a little different. ... So we\\textbackslash{}'ve got a new relationship,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Bush told reporters traveling with him aboard Air Force One to the four-nation Colombia drug summit. ``It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it\\textbackslash{}'s different,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said the president, who has averaged one question and answer session with reporters each week since taking <b> office </b> 13 months ago. Later, Bush\\textbackslash{}'s press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the <b> president </b> was ``just kidding\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in asserting that he would have fewer news conferences and in declining comment on a series of questions. ``He was having fun,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Fitzwater said. The president, who apparently read a wire service account of his testy mood on the plane, protested to reporters later: ``I\\textbackslash{}'m not fuming.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Bush\\textbackslash{}'s pique apparently was triggered by an ABC-TV report Wednesday night recapping instances in which Bush\\textbackslash{}'s words were belied by subsequent events. The <b> president </b> was criticized on the same score in a Feb. 26 article in The New Republic entitled, ``The Deceiving Line.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Most recently Bush told a news conference on Monday that it wasn\\textbackslash{}'t time yet for a conference among the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France on the future status of Germany. ``Not at this juncture,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he told the news conference. Yet, the next day, a major agreement was announced in Ottawa by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a German reunification push that would include a <b> summit </b> among the four powers that vanquished Germany in World War II. ``When I told you ... that I didn\\textbackslash{}'t think there\\textbackslash{}'d be a deal and there shortly was a deal, then I\\textbackslash{}'m hit for deceiving you,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Bush groused Thursday. Bush, a onetime CIA director, has conducted much of his foreign policy in secrecy. Two missions to China by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft came despite a Bush announcement in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown that he was barring high-level exchanges between the two countries. The <b> president </b> later insisted that Scowcroft\\textbackslash{}'s trips to Beijing were ``visits\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and not ``exchanges,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and thus not covered by the Bush edict. Bush, who usually maintains a bantering relationship with reporters, said, ``I think we\\textbackslash{}'ve had too many press conferences. It overdoes it. It\\textbackslash{}'s overexposure.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' By answering few questions directly, he said, ``I\\textbackslash{}'m not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The president, who slept the night before on Air Force One so he would be well-rested for Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s pre-dawn flight here, even gave a prickly response when asked if he had gotten a good night\\textbackslash{}'s sleep. ``I had a very good night\\textbackslash{}'s sleep. I can\\textbackslash{}'t get into the details of that because some will say it\\textbackslash{}'s too much sleep, some will say it\\textbackslash{}'s too little. ...,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Bush parried a series of questions from reporters, most of them dealing with the drug summit. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m not going to discuss what I\\textbackslash{}'m going to bring up,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Bush said when asked about his agenda for the day\\textbackslash{}'s conference in Cartagena with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m not going to discuss whether there\\textbackslash{}'s any surprises or not. This is a new thing. This is a new approach.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He then said his non-answers were ``a trial run\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for later dealings with the media. In fact, Bush, who answers reporters questions about once a week, planned to finish his day in Colombia with yet another news conference. Bush\\textbackslash{}'s comments with reporters came shortly before his jet touched down here, where a U.S. press center was set up at the airport. Bush flew by helicopter the 60 miles to Cartagena and was returning here before flying home to Washington. Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio Barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to extradite them to the United States if they turned over drug labs, Bush snapped: ``I have no comment whatsoever on that. I have no comment on whether I know about it or not. I can\\textbackslash{}'t comment on whether it\\textbackslash{}'s true or not.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Bush did not mention which particular news reports had irked him the most. However, Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s editions of the Washington Post had a story on what it called ``the debate between President Bush and the press over secrecy and deception.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' And ABC-TV had a news report on Wednesday night by White House correspondent Brit Hume on the same subject. Hume was one of several reporters invited to a recent off the record lunch at the White House with Bush, at which the subject reportedly came up. News accounts said that Bush told the reporters at the lunch that he had undertaken no further secret diplomatic missions \\_ like Scowcroft\\textbackslash{}'s clandestine visits to China. Then, the next day, it was disclosed that Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger had gone on a secret mission to London to notify U.S. allies of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s latest plan to reduce troops in Europe. Bush also gave what some have seen as misleading comments on his surprise seaside <b> summit </b> at Malta in December with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The <b> president </b> in September had said that there were no plans for a superpower <b> summit </b> before 1990, but he later revealed that the session had been arranged as early as last July. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  company stock offer corp companies billion business sale share agreement firm sell deal company\\textbackslash{}'s bid takeover york shares board announced </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.717134029243594  \\textbackslash{}n   Irving Bank Corp. is backing a sweetened merger <b> offer </b> from Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, which rival Bank of New York Corp. contends is still inferior to its own hostile bid.

Irving said the sweetened <b> offer </b> made the overall transaction worth at least \\$79.50 per share, which the bank holding <b> company\\textbackslash{}'s </b> <b> board </b> of directors deemed superior to Bank of New York\\textbackslash{}'s ``best and final bid.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Under a complex restructuring plan that also would include the <b> sale </b> of assets and a special cash dividend, Banca Commerciale has offered \\$80 cash a <b> share </b> for 51 percent of Irving\\textbackslash{}'s common stock, or a total of about \\$760 million. The new <b> agreement </b> also provides for Irving to distribute a dividend in the form of <b> stock </b> warrants to all Irving shareholders before the Banca Commerciale tender offer. The warrants, one for every four <b> shares </b> of Irving stock, would have a term of seven years and an exercise price of \\$65 per <b> share </b> of Irving stock. The new <b> deal </b> means Banca Commerciale would be offering the same amount of money for Irving <b> shares </b> even though the <b> shares </b> would be worth less to the Italian bank because of the distribution by Irving. Irving said BCI\\textbackslash{}'s financial adviser, Lazard Freres \\& Co., put the value of the warrants to shareholders at \\$4 to \\$7 per <b> share </b> of Irving common stock. Irving <b> stock </b> closed at \\$71.37\\{ per share, up 12\\{ cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday. Bank of New York rose \\$1.25 per <b> share </b> to \\$36.12\\{. Bank of New York responded that its <b> bid </b> for all of Irving\\textbackslash{}'s <b> stock </b> remained superior. Owen Brady, a spokesman for Bank of New York, said BNY\\textbackslash{}'s financial adviser Morgan Stanley \\& Co. projected that if Irving <b> stock </b> sold for \\$45 a <b> share </b> after a merger with BCI, the warrants effectively would add no more than \\$1.35 per <b> share </b> in value to BCI\\textbackslash{}'s previous offer.

Irving steadfastly has rejected Bank of New York\\textbackslash{}'s <b> takeover </b> advances, which surfaced last September. Estimates of the value of the offers have differed widely. The Irving <b> board </b> said analyses by its advisers, Goldman, Sachs \\& Co. and J.P. Morgan \\& Co. Inc., said the Banca Commerciale <b> offer </b> was worth \\$74 to \\$79.50 a share.

The railroad, energy and real-estate conglomerate said Monday that its <b> board </b> of directors approved a previously <b> announced </b> plan to spin off Santa Fe Energy Resources and Catellus Development Corp., formerly Santa Fe Pacific Realty, to shareholders. Santa Fe stockholders of record as of Nov. 29 will receive a special, tax-free dividend consisting of one <b> share </b> of common <b> stock </b> of Santa Fe Energy Resources for every 3.3 <b> shares </b> of Santa Fe Pacific held, and one <b> share </b> of Catellus for every 4 <b> shares </b> of Santa Fe Pacific.

The spinoffs will leave the Chicago-based parent <b> company </b> with three interests: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and a 44 percent stake in Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines. Santa Fe <b> announced </b> in April its plan to spin off the Houston-based energy and San Francisco-based real-estate units as part of a far-reaching restructuring program begun in 1987. Chairman Robert Krebs said in a statement that the values of Santa Fe\\textbackslash{}'s diversified assets have not been reflected in Santa Fe\\textbackslash{}'s <b> stock </b> price.

Maxwell and Societe Generale agreed in June to cooperate in creating a joint venture in communications, and the two sides had broached the possibility of Maxwell acquiring <b> shares </b> in Societe Generale. But the negotiations were interrupted when Maxwell turned his attention to Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publishing and information services <b> company </b> he has offered to acquire for \\$2.47 <b> billion </b> in cash. This week Macmillan agreed to a \\$2.5 <b> billion </b> cash-and-securities buyout by the investment <b> firm </b> Kohlberg Kravis Roberts \\& Co., but Maxwell said he was mulling his options. On Wednesday, Maxwell said he remained interested in acquiring a stake in Societe Generale and that talks may resume soon. A spokesman for Societe Generale said, ``We continue to be interested in having more international shareholders.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Maxwell appears primarily drawn to Societe Generale\\textbackslash{}'s media interests, which are concentrated in Tractebel SA. </p> 0.643430305298964  \\textbackslash{}n   British publisher Robert Maxwell said Friday he will launch a \\$2.1 <b> billion </b> cash tender <b> offer </b> for Macmillan Inc. next week, but made clear his main interest is acquiring its information services business. Macmillan already is the subject of a \\$1.9 <b> billion </b> <b> bid </b> from Robert M. Bass Group Inc., a Texas-based investment group. In a letter to Macmillan, Maxwell said he would drop his \\$80-a-share tender <b> offer </b> if Macmillan would <b> sell </b> him the information company, which Macmillan proposed to separate from its publishing <b> business </b> in a corporate restructuring. Maxwell said his Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC would be willing to pay ``not less than \\$1.1 billion\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in cash for the information business, noting that Macmillan\\textbackslash{}'s investment bankers had valued it at ``a range of \\$800 million to slightly in excess of \\$1 billion.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In the letter, Maxwell also told Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans he was ``willing to explore other forms of transactions with you\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold a significant stake in the company. Maxwell also reitereated he wanted to retain Macmillan management. Macmillan declined to comment on Maxwell\\textbackslash{}'s proposals. On Wall Street, the price of Macmillan <b> stock </b> rose \\$1.50 a <b> share </b> to \\$83.25, indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate. ``Some people suggested Maxwell isn\\textbackslash{}'t serious, but by launching a tender <b> offer </b> at \\$80 a <b> share </b> on Monday, we see he is serious,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing <b> business </b> for the brokerage Raymond James \\& Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. But Boksen said by making the alternate suggestion that he be sold the information assets, Maxwell ``identified the piece he is most interested in.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``I think Macmillan is backed up against the wall and will try to find a white knight,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. He said Macmillan could be worth \\$90 a share. The overture from Maxwell came only three days before a scheduled court hearing in Delaware on whether Macmillan should be allowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring. The restructuring, <b> announced </b> in late May, would split the <b> company </b> into separate publishing and information services concerns and pay shareholders a special dividend of \\$52.35 a <b> share </b> in cash. That plan was advanced after the Bass Group proposed to pay \\$64 a <b> share </b> for the Macmillan <b> stock </b> it did not already own. The Bass Group subsequently sweetened its <b> offer </b> twice, and launched its own tender <b> offer </b> for Macmillan at \\$75 a share. The Bass Group won an order from Delaware Chancery Court blocking Macmillan from proceeding with its restructuring. Macmillan appealed the decision to Delaware Supreme Court, which scheduled a hearing for Monday. Maxwell disclosed his interest in Macmillan in mid-July, saying he would be interested in paying \\$80 a <b> share </b> for its 25.9 million <b> shares </b> in a friendly transaction. A Maxwell spokesman said Friday that the tender <b> offer </b> at that price would commence on Monday. It is contingent on dropping the restructuring plan, among other things, but Maxwell said it is not conditioned upon obtaining necessary financing. Late last month, the Macmillan <b> board </b> rejected the \\$75 a <b> share </b> <b> offer </b> from Bass as inadequate, but took no position on the Maxwell proposal. Macmillan spokesman David Jackson refused Friday to comment on whether the <b> board </b> has since met to discuss the Maxwell proposal, or anything else. Maxwell has vowed to make Maxwell Communications one of the world\\textbackslash{}'s biggest media and communications businesses. Through that <b> company </b> and Pergamon Press, Maxwell controls the Mirror Group of newspapers in Great Britain, is one of America\\textbackslash{}'s largest printers of magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishing academic and scientific journals. </p> 0.628296633386678  \\textbackslash{}n   The London <b> firm </b> Ward White Group PLC has said it is not interested in pursuing the acquisition of Payless Cashways Inc. after reviewing information about the building materials firm. ``Any interest we had is withdrawn,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' David Bick, a spokesman for Ward White, said Monday. Molson Cos. Ltd., a diversified Canadian company, also said Monday that it did not have any interest in acquiring Payless after examining public information about the company.

Vic Feazell, McLennan County district attorney, said Sunday his <b> office </b> is re-examining Ida Lee Baugh\\textbackslash{}'s slaying in December 1983 and that a National Enquirer reporter\\textbackslash{}'s new <b> information </b> could help him resolve ``unanswered questions.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Feazell said the inquiry was not aimed at Swaggart but could involve ``one or more individuals connected with the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at that time.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``What we are looking into right now is the possibility of violations of the Texas Penal Code that could include being a party to murder,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Feazell said. Jacqueline Euna Warren was convicted in April 1984 of murder in the <b> case </b> and sentenced to 99 years in prison. Mrs. Baugh, 70, of McGregor, was found stabbed and beaten and died later at a Waco hospital. Her husband, Maurice Patrick Baugh, died of heart failure five days later. In their will, the couple left all but 25 percent of their cash, not to exceed \\$25,000, to the ministry in Baton Rouge, La. A Swaggart spokesman estimated the couple\\textbackslash{}'s total estate at between \\$500,000 and \\$800,000. Baugh\\textbackslash{}'s son contested the will, charging that associates of Jimmy Swaggart ministries exercised undue influence on his parents to change their will. Larry Neale Baugh alleged that two men working on behalf of Swaggart Ministries had recommended that Ms. Warren take care of Mrs. Baugh. Later, Larry Baugh dropped his charges. The Waco Tribune-Herald quoted a source familiar with the <b> case </b> as saying a settlement was reached between Baugh and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. Feazell said a National Enquirer reporter approached him with new <b> information </b> he had developed independently. ``The <b> information </b> was believeable and parts of it have been substantiated,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said.

U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum on Monday also ordered Roy M. Furmark, a private consultant in the oil industry, to <b> pay </b> Ashland \\$15,000 in restitution. Furmark pleaded guilty in March to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Furmark, of Brooklyn, testified to Congress in 1987 that he was <b> involved </b> in the sale of American arms to Iran. In the Ashland case, Furmark cooperated with prosecutors for more than a year before his plea and helped implicate former Ashland chairman Orin E. Atkins in the conspiracy. On Friday, Atkins, who also pleaded guilty to conspiracy, was sentenced to two years probation and 600 hours of community service for his role in the scheme. Furmark admitted that he agreed to help Atkins arrange meetings with representatives of the Iranian National Oil Co., which was contemplating a <b> lawsuit </b> against Ashland for the company\\textbackslash{}'s decision not to <b> pay </b> \\$283 million for crude oil purchased in 1979. Atkins has said he wanted to sell to the Iranians confidential <b> documents </b> involving the disputed oil deal that he obtained after he was forced to resign as chairman in 1981 but remained as a paid Ashland consultant. While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued Ashland and last year obtained a \\$325 million settlement, which with interest was worth more than \\$500 million. ``This episode in my life has been totally uncharacteristic to my life and what I stand for,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Furmark told Cedarbaum. ``I am deeply sorry.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Cedarbaum said she considered Furmark\\textbackslash{}'s cooperation in deciding his sentence.

The <b> lawsuit </b> was <b> filed </b> by the National Conference of Bar Examiners, or NCBE, a Chicago company that prepares the Multistate Bar Examination \\_ 200 multiple-choice <b> questions </b> administered to law graduates in 46 states. The <b> suit </b> accuses Multistate Legal Studies Inc. of Philadelphia and Santa Monica, Calif., of sending agents to purposely fail the bar exam, giving them the right to review the tests. While reviewing the exams, the agents memorized, photographed, hand copied or tape recorded the questions, according to the lawsuit. The <b> suit </b> names Multistate president Robert Feinberg as an agent. Feinberg, an attorney living in California, denied the <b> allegations </b> and noted that his company won a similar <b> suit </b> <b> filed </b> in 1978. The NCBE <b> claims </b> the ``integrity and quality of the process by which applicants are admitted to the practice of law\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' was tainted by Multistate, which also operates under the name of Preliminary Multistate Bar Review. The <b> suit </b> seeks unspecified damages as well as injunctions against further copyright infringement. According to the suit, about 100,000 students in 40 states have enrolled in the courses with Preliminary Multistate Bar Review since 1977. The three- and six-day seminars cost \\$295 to \\$495 with an additional \\$395 for written materials, \\$100 for cassette tapes and about \\$50 for flashcards. The Multistate Bar Exam, used since 1972, is given twice a year on six subjects. About 58,000 applicants took the exam last year. Questions are prepared by committees of practitioners, judges and law professors and reviewed by others at a cost of about \\$250,000 per test form. The NCBE releases 50 <b> questions </b> to the public every other year, but does not reuse released questions. The NCBE also prepares other portions of the test, including a essay section and a section on professional responsibility.

Martin in a new Agriculture Department report. ``Waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of <b> fish </b> at aquacultural facilities include diving ducks, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, kingfishers, blackbirds, ospreys and anhingas.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' These <b> birds </b> \\_ the diving ducks include grebes, cormorants and mergansers \\_ were described as ``voracious <b> fish </b> eaters\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that not only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to <b> fish </b> stock. ``Due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the <b> fish </b> they consumed are diseased, predatory <b> birds </b> may transmit diseases from pond to pond,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. Moreover, when <b> fish </b> farmers attempt to guard against the airborne marauders, they can be frustrated because a majority of the <b> birds </b> are legally categorized as migratory and are protected under federal and <b> state </b> laws. Martin, a student at Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga., worked as an intern for the department\\textbackslash{}'s Economic Research Service the last two summers. Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by <b> fish </b> species and location, she said losses to <b> birds </b> have been reported on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical <b> fish </b> and trout, and are greatest in the largest aquaculture states: Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California and Georgia. ``Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the summer,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Martin said. ``In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers, herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late <b> summer </b> and early fall.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' She added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to shellfish, although swans occasionally are problems. ``Catfish in the Southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas (locally called <b> water </b> turkeys) and kingfishers during the spring and <b> summer </b> months,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Martin said. ``Herons and cormorants cause problems year-round. Crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by purple grackles, herons, egrets, ibises, gulls, diving ducks and kingfishers.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as perimeter fencing, netting, overhead wires and other devices, including fireworks, exploders and similar items used to frighten birds. Some chemicals, such as Avitrol, a registered ``frightening agent\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for use on herring gulls and blackbirds, have also been effective, she said. But <b> state </b> and federal permits are required to use this chemical on gulls, because they are legally protected. After ingesting the chemical, the gull ``will behave erratically and emit distress calls,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' which frighten away the other birds, she said. Some migratory game <b> birds </b> may be shot during the hunting season, and other permits are available for some species. Local <b> state </b> and federal <b> wildlife </b> authorities should be contacted. Still, Martin said, some <b> fish </b> farmers believe ``birds are uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile, no matter what method of control of prevention is used.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.533946644642189  \\textbackslash{}n   Wood storks have come home to roost in southern Florida, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered <b> birds </b> won\\textbackslash{}'t have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season. Summer deluges at the storks\\textbackslash{}' two major ancestral breeding grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the <b> fish </b> the <b> birds </b> rely on for food, they explained. Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, a National Audubon Society refuge about 20 miles <b> north </b> of Naples that was once the primary stork-nesting area in North America. Another 75 pairs have taken up residence at Everglades National Park\\textbackslash{}'s Cuthbert Island. The two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by North America\\textbackslash{}'s sole species of stork, a giant white bird with an iron-black head. ``We are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Paul Hinchcliff, chief naturalist at Corkscrew. ``Whether or not there\\textbackslash{}'s enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge enough young remains to be seen.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have ended disastrously, said John Ogden, who heads a wood stork study team at Everglades National Park. If they are unable to feed offspring, parent <b> birds </b> will abandon the colony, leaving hundreds of crying young <b> birds </b> to starve. Wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers at Corkscrew since 1984-85, when 353 pairs of <b> birds </b> successfully raised 530 young. Fifty years ago, it was common to see 6,000 to 8,000 pairs of storks nesting in the gray-boughed cypress trees. Since the early 1960s, however, storks have been spurning Corkscrew in favor of central and northern Florida and other Southern states. Between 1960 and 1980, the wood stork nesting population at Corkscrew dropped by 75 percent. The renewed Corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the total U.S. stork population, estimated at 4,000. Historically, storks came to Corkscrew by the tens of thousands to nest in early winter, leaving plenty of time to rear offspring before the onset of rain. But human activity disrupted the annual cycle of high-water summers and low-water winters in Florida\\textbackslash{}'s wetlands. Much of the area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions. The <b> birds </b> have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the deeper waters of the <b> interior </b> Everglades to drop low enough for them to efficiently feed. As result, nesting is delayed, and this year\\textbackslash{}'s young won\\textbackslash{}'t be ready to leave their nests until about mid-July, Ogden said. </p> 0.474262413270188  \\textbackslash{}n   The red-cockaded woodpecker, once common in the Southeast, still ranges from Texas to the Carolinas, but is <b> found </b> mainly in isolated populations on federal lands.

At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December\\textbackslash{}'s deep freeze stopped them from clogging <b> water </b> intakes but they quickly settled inside the plant. ``They like it where it\\textbackslash{}'s dimly lit, they like it where it\\textbackslash{}'s warm, and they don\\textbackslash{}'t like a lot of turbulence.

Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at the plant. ``By July, we\\textbackslash{}'re going to have a massive problem with them.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Three years after they were introduced to North America and after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread throughout the <b> lake </b> and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It\\textbackslash{}'s an invasion scientists say could affect farming, <b> fishing </b> and daily life along virtually every body of fresh <b> water </b> in North America in the next few years. The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love intake pipes of <b> water </b> and power plants because the current brings them a steady supply of fresh food. A mussel can filter more than a gallon of <b> water </b> an hour, said R. Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave <b> water </b> cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would certainly be a benefit, I guess,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds, and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said Charles O\\textbackslash{}'Neill, with the Sea Grant program at the State University College at Brockport. The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, Flint said. But with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they could deplete the supply for the small <b> fish </b> that support the billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry. And the bad news could spread beyond the <b> lake </b> and its shoreline. Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation <b> water </b> from the lakes can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because of the shells, O\\textbackslash{}'Neill said. ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet to the <b> water </b> at your tap,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' O\\textbackslash{}'Neill said. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s not just an environmental problem.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in theory, to be edible by humans, Flint said. But when Canadian researchers tried steaming a bunch, O\\textbackslash{}'Neill said, ``What they got was a stench that cleared the lab.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The mussels have plagued Europe for more than a century and are believed to have arrived in North America on a freighter that emptied its ballast tanks in Lake St. Clair, upstream from Lake Erie, in 1986. Scientists are studying the possibility that the Lake Erie infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986 event, O\\textbackslash{}'Neill said. But Flint said one colony could have infested the <b> lake </b> because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells. ``They could easily get across Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in that period of time,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. For public <b> water </b> systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the intake pipe rather than waiting until the <b> water </b> is inside the plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have already faced the problem. Power plants have a different problem, because officials are reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in cooling <b> water </b> discharged back to the lake, Henderson said. Niagara Mohawk and the <b> state </b> Department of Environmental Conservation are negotiating a solution. James Sell, chief operator of the Dunkirk <b> water </b> plant, is studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe\\textbackslash{}'s mouth, like building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine pipe out through the intake. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re better off than the people in the <b> western </b> end of the lake,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sell said. ``At least we have some time to do something by spring.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The City Council hasn\\textbackslash{}'t been persuaded to pay up to \\$100,000 for the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to show visitors, said, ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t see much option for them if they want a <b> water </b> supply.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Farther inland, many <b> water </b> officials are unaware of the problem or not prepared to do anything about it. Michael Burke, director of the <b> state </b> Health Department\\textbackslash{}'s bureau of public <b> water </b> supply protection, said the department was studying the problem but doesn\\textbackslash{}'t see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word\\textbackslash{}'s getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in the Great Lakes. It is coming out in industry papers and things of that sort.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' O\\textbackslash{}'Neill and other scientists said the <b> state </b> should do more to get the word out, because it is only a matter of time \\_ and not necessarily very much time. ``The chances of them getting into the <b> western </b> reach of the Erie Canal is good,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' O\\textbackslash{}'Neill said. ``The canal is an ideal place for them to live. It\\textbackslash{}'s warm. It\\textbackslash{}'s shallow. Most of it has rock riprap to attach to.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their engine housings and other places where <b> water </b> collects. Once the mussels get into Lake Michigan, they will almost certainly spread through the Chicago River and into the Mississippi River basin, O\\textbackslash{}'Neill said. ``Any area in North America that is utilizing surface <b> water </b> should be concerned.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.436668989864492  \\textbackslash{}n   They could have been cremation pits, cock-fighting rings, animal pens, Civil War foxholes or secret hiding places for moonshine equipment. Maybe they were prehistoric Indian burial sites, charcoal pits or foundations for native American abodes. Or maybe, some say, the <b> stone </b> circles dotting the <b> western </b> slope of Polish Mountain encircled apple <b> trees </b> in the early 1900s. For more than a decade, 150 to 200 circles of sandstone rock have puzzled area residents and archaelogists. Virtually hidden by brush and poison ivy, the gray-colored rocks of various shapes and sizes are neatly arranged in circles. No one knows their purpose, or who put them there. ``Everybody that goes up there has some kind of weird theory,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said John Mash, manager of Green Ridge State Forest, where the circles are found. ``One guy even mentioned that they could have been sweat lodges \\_ like a Turkish bath. ``The Indians would have these rituals when they would go into manhood,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``They would go in these buildings with hot rocks and put <b> water </b> on them \\_ something like a sauna.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But 150 to 200 saunas on one hillside in <b> western </b> Maryland? Mash said rangers noticed the <b> stone </b> rings in the early 1970s. In 1975, Mash contacted State Archaeologist Tyler J. Bastian, who visited the site and put the circles on a list of archaeological areas in Maryland. But it was not until last year that some archaelogists and volunteers excavated one of the circles. ``They did the dig and <b> found </b> zip, except for the rattlesnakes,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mash said. Hoping to uncover clues, another group conducted a dig this spring. ``In a nutshell, we didn\\textbackslash{}'t discover anything. They still remain a mystery,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Charles McVeigh Jr., a member of the Western Maryland Archaeological Society. ``We dug out in the center of them. We didn\\textbackslash{}'t go down very far before we got to bedrock. We <b> found </b> no artifacts. We <b> found </b> nothing to indicate prehistoric use.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' No future digs are planned, and two local archaeologists who took an interest in the circles, Robert D. Wall and Connie Huddleston, both have moved from Maryland. Neither could be reached for comment recently. Meanwhile, the <b> state </b> forest has put the circles on its historic preservation list to ensure the five-acre tract remains untouched, Mash said. The site could be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places if additional information could be <b> found </b> to document the age of the rings, their use and significance. Mash has dismissed the moonshine theory because there is no nearby <b> water </b> source needed to make moonshine. He said he did not think they were cock-fighting rings because only one pit is needed to hold a fight. And the rings are too close together to have been foxholes during the Civil War, he said. ``The site has no strategic value,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mash said. ``(And) the guy in the middle foxhole is going to be shooting his own pals before he can get his bullet out to hit the bad guys.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Until someone conjures up a more believable theory, Mash said he puts the most stock in the orchard theory \\_ that someone placed the stones around apple <b> trees </b> that once grew in the area. There were 1 million apple <b> trees </b> in Green Ridge by 1914, he said. ``It is possible that they hired immigrants who could not understand directions given in English and some of them were told to clear the rocks away to plant the apple trees,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he suggested. ``They were new in America and wanted to do a nice, neat job, so they put these rocks in nice neat little circles and left a space in the middle for the tree. And they might have worked on these for a couple of days, or a week until somebody stopped them. That could be a theory ...\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  percent poll survey found conducted points error voters results margin surveys sunday apple percentage lead arthritis choice released blacks journal </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.548634839018024  \\textbackslash{}n   President Bush has a 56 <b> percent </b> approval rating among blacks, a huge increase over the ratings given former President Reagan, according to a new CBS News-New York Times poll. Only 13 <b> percent </b> of <b> blacks </b> supported Reagan at about the same point in his presidency, CBS Evening News reported Thursday. In May 1982, Reagan had a 73 <b> percent </b> disapproval rating among blacks; in the current poll, 26 <b> percent </b> of <b> blacks </b> surveyed disapproved of Bush, said Kathleen A. Frankovic, of the CBS network\\textbackslash{}'s polling division. CBS-Times polls <b> conducted </b> during Reagan\\textbackslash{}'s entire time in office <b> found </b> he had an average 67 <b> percent </b> disapproval rating among blacks, Frankovic said. The new <b> survey </b> is the fourth consecutive Times-CBS News <b> poll </b> in the last six months in which a majority of <b> blacks </b> said they approved of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s handling of his job, the Times reported in today\\textbackslash{}'s editions. For the last 30 years, five out of six <b> blacks </b> have voted for the Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who the nominee was, CBS reported. In the new poll, one out of 10 <b> blacks </b> said they probably would vote for Bush against a Democratic candidate in 1992, while another 20 <b> percent </b> said their <b> choice </b> would depend on who was running, the Times said. One-third of the <b> blacks </b> surveyed, and 46 <b> percent </b> of the whites, said their opinion of Bush had improved since he became president, the Times said. Blacks were evenly divided on whether Bush is doing a good job handling the war on drugs, while whites approved 56 <b> percent </b> to 35 percent, the Times said. White respondents gave Bush an overall approval rating of 75 <b> percent </b> to 14 percent. The telephone <b> poll </b> of 1,515 adult Americans, including 403 blacks, was <b> conducted </b> March 30-April 2.

The new <b> results </b> contrast with a series of <b> surveys </b> in recent weeks indicating Bush trailed Dukakis in double digits. A telephone <b> survey </b> of 1,013 adults last week by ABC News and Money Magazine, <b> released </b> Wednesday, <b> found </b> 45 <b> percent </b> support for Dukakis and 42 <b> percent </b> for Bush. That amounts to a tie, given the <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> of plus or minus 4 <b> percentage </b> points. And a Gallup <b> poll </b> of 1,210 voters, also out Wednesday, suggested Dukakis had the support of 46 percent, to 41 <b> percent </b> for Bush. The <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> was 3 <b> percentage </b> points. By contrast, Gallup, NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Washington Post polls <b> conducted </b> since June 9 have <b> found </b> double-digit leads for Dukakis. The Post survey, done June 15-19, <b> found </b> a 51-39 <b> percent </b> Dukakis margin. The ABC-Money Magazine poll, <b> conducted </b> June 22-25, <b> found </b> support for Dukakis down 7 <b> points </b> from an ABC-Post <b> poll </b> in mid-May that used the same methodology. Bush rose only from 41 to 42 <b> percent </b> support; those who didn\\textbackslash{}'t know grew from 2 <b> percent </b> to 6 percent. The rest said they wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t vote or would support someone else. Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories. A Harris <b> survey </b> early this month <b> found </b> a dead heat \\_ 49-44, with a 3-point <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> \\_ and a USA Today-CNN <b> poll </b> gave Dukakis a single-digit lead. The ABC-Money Magazine <b> poll </b> had Dukakis leading among women, respondents earning less than \\$25,000 a year and adults aged 35 to 54.

Bush\\textbackslash{}'s 60 <b> percent </b> overall approval rating in the <b> poll </b> is the worst of his presidency, but still higher than that recorded for Presidents Reagan and Carter at the same point in their administrations. The <b> poll </b> <b> found </b> a majority of Americans still approves of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s actions in the Persian Gulf, but the 57 <b> percent </b> approval rating is down from 75 <b> percent </b> soon after the invasion. The <b> poll </b> <b> found </b> 34 <b> percent </b> disapproved of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s handling of Iraq. Asked to rate Bush\\textbackslash{}'s handling of the economy, 52 <b> percent </b> said they disapproved and 36 <b> percent </b> said they approved. In August, 45 <b> percent </b> approved of Bush\\textbackslash{}'s handling of the economy, and 44 <b> percent </b> disapproved. Amid heightened concern over Bush\\textbackslash{}'s handling of the economy and the budget deficit, 30 <b> percent </b> said they disapproved of his overall performance - the highest level of his presidency in the CBS-New York Times poll. The <b> poll </b> was <b> conducted </b> among a random sample of 960 adults around the United States interviewed by telephone Monday through Wednesday.

The network reported Thursday that Dukakis leaped to a 53-41 <b> percent </b> <b> lead </b> in a <b> survey </b> of 450 registered <b> voters </b> Wednesday, up from his 45-46 virtual dead heat with Bush in ABC\\textbackslash{}'s <b> poll </b> Sunday. The movement was 13 <b> points </b> \\_ from 1 point down to 12 up. The jump was expected; polls in other elections have <b> found </b> that nominees often gain support immediately after their party\\textbackslash{}'s convention. Such bumps frequently settle back down as <b> voters </b> focus on the substance of the race. The <b> survey </b> reflected the success of Dukakis\\textbackslash{}' peacemaking with Jesse Jackson, his opponent for the nomination. Sixty-eight <b> percent </b> said Dukakis was treating Jackson fairly, up from 52 <b> percent </b> in a <b> poll </b> early this month. Similarly, 70 <b> percent </b> said Jackson was treating Dukakis fairly, and the share of respondents with an unfavorable view of Jackson fell 11 <b> points </b> from Sunday, to 31 percent. Those with a favorable view rose 9 <b> points </b> to 52. The national <b> survey </b> <b> found </b> a rise in unfavorable views of Bush, who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week. His favorable rating fell from 49 <b> percent </b> to 41 percent, while those viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 <b> percent </b> Sunday to 44 <b> percent </b> Wednesday. The poll, completed the day before Dukakis appeared at the convention, <b> found </b> little change in his favorable-unfavorable rating, 55-21. Dukakis\\textbackslash{}' 12-point <b> lead </b> against Bush did not mark his greatest numerical advantage in an ABC poll; the Massachusetts governor led by 53-40 in late May. The <b> margin </b> of <b> error </b> for the new <b> poll </b> was 5 points. Such single-day surveys, particularly when <b> conducted </b> during or just after a highly publicized event, tend to measure visceral reactions rther than considered opinion, so the views they gauge can change rapidly. Dukakis continued to do better with women <b> voters </b> than with men, and the <b> poll </b> Wednesday <b> found </b> that he had gained more ground among women \\_ leading Bush by 25 <b> points </b> in the new poll, up from an 8-point <b> lead </b> Sunday. Dukakis scored a tie with Bush among men, after a 12-point Bush <b> lead </b> Sunday. Dukakis improved with independents, scoring 48-42 against Bush after a 52-35 <b> lead </b> for Bush among independents Sunday. And 59 <b> percent </b> of Democrats who had bolted the party to vote for President Reagan favored Dukakis now. In another measure of the convention\\textbackslash{}'s impact, 52 <b> percent </b> said the Democrats could be trusted to do a better job with the nation\\textbackslash{}'s problems, up 9 <b> points </b> from Sunday. And 40 <b> percent </b> said they generally approved of the proceedings in Atlanta, while just 13 <b> percent </b> disapproved. Nearly half said they had not been paying enough attention to say. </p> 0.399764014728187  \\textbackslash{}n   The Associated Press <b> poll </b> on homelessness was <b> conducted </b> by telephone Dec. 5-9 among a random sample of 1,004 adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa. The <b> results </b> were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The <b> poll </b> had a three-point <b> margin </b> of sampling error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within three <b> points </b> of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions.

These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. Is your knowledge of the homeless a result of something you have seen or dealt with in person, or is it just based on news reports and word of mouth? In person: 45 percent. Word of mouth: 54 percent. Don\\textbackslash{}'t know or no answer: 2 percent. 2. Which of the following statements best reflects your attitude toward the homeless in the United States today? - The homeless themselves are mainly at fault because of their unwillingness to work or their behavior, such as alcohol or drug use: 17 percent. - Our society is mainly at fault because we do not provide sufficient housing for them: 20 percent. - Neither the homeless nor society is mainly at fault because they become homeless through tough breaks or bad economic luck: 41 percent. - (volunteered answer) Combination of both homeless and society: 17 percent. - Don\\textbackslash{}'t know or no answer: 5 percent. 3. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should be increased, decreased, or remain the same? Increased: 58 percent. Decreased: 7 percent. Remain the same: 23 percent. DK-NA: 12 percent. (For those who said increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for that? Yes: 75 percent. No: 22 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent. 4. I\\textbackslash{}'m going to ask you to rate the chances that you or a member of your family could become homeless in the coming year. Do you personally feel the chances are ... Very likely: 4 percent. Somewhat likely: 11 percent. Somewhat unlikely: 16 percent. Not at all likely: 67 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent. 5. Do you know someone who has become homeless in the last year?

A few armed policemen entered deserted <b> police </b> stations late <b> today </b> but allowed no one to enter. A 10-hour curfew restricting <b> people </b> to their homes began at 7 p.m. and some policemen in jeeps and trucks patrolled the city. Monday\\textbackslash{}'s <b> violence </b> was the worst since April 6, when <b> police </b> opened <b> fire </b> on pro-democracy demonstrators, and threatened the fledgling pro-democracy movement in this Himalayan kingdom. Until this month, King Birendra had exercised virtually absolute power. Five civilians were <b> killed </b> by <b> police </b> gunfire in Monday\\textbackslash{}'s unrest and, according to the state-owned Rashtriya Samachar Samiti news agency, 15 policemen were missing. Only one policeman had been found by late today. The mobs accused <b> police </b> of condoning and sometimes joining an underground pro-monarchist group blamed for a wave of crime since a new government headed by pro-democracy forces took office last week. Two policemen captured early Monday were beaten for more than six hours before they died. Four more policemen were dragged from a <b> police </b> station and lynched by hundreds of people. The crowds also set afire the zonal commissioner\\textbackslash{}'s office, which houses a <b> police </b> station. Today, two policemen in riot gear stood guard outside the charred building. They were the only policemen seen on foot during an hour-long tour of Katmandu. ``There are no policemen anywhere in the city,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said a taxi driver who said he had been driving the <b> streets </b> for six hours. ``Even traffic policemen are absent today.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' One government source said the policemen were either ``unofficially withdrawn or are too scared to come out.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Senior <b> police </b> officials could not be located for comment. But shops opened and <b> streets </b> were clogged with traffic <b> today </b> after a ten-hour curfew clamped on Monday night was lifted at 6 a.m..

No details of the meeting were available. A scheduled meeting of the Cabinet was postponed, officials said on condition of anonymity. There had been indications a shake-up in the top ranks of the <b> police </b> force might be forthcoming after the Cabinet meeting. Bhattarai and his government, a coalition of democrats, Communists, royalists and independents, took office last Thursday after an eight-week campaign against the previous regime, which was subservient to the king. King Birendra caved in to the campaign on April 8, two days after <b> police </b> shot and <b> killed </b> 200 <b> demonstrators </b> as they marched on the palace, according to witnesses. The government said 10 <b> people </b> were <b> killed </b> and 107 wounded in all of Nepal on that day, but two days later Birendra lifted a 29-year ban on political parties. Within 24 hours of the new government taking office, the <b> capital </b> of 250,000 <b> people </b> was faced with a rash of arson, mugging and looting, which residents blamed on a right-wing pro-monarchist group called Mandale. The Mandale, an abbreviated form of Nepal Vidyarthi Mandal, or Nepal <b> students </b> group, went underground in 1979 after Birendra officially banned the group because of its violent tendencies. </p> 0.477138331219829  \\textbackslash{}n   Five radical <b> students </b> armed with bombs and knives seized a U.S. Information Service office <b> today </b> and detonated two bombs and started a <b> fire </b> before <b> police </b> overpowered them. Two of the <b> students </b> brandishing explosive devices and draped in South Korean flags stood at shattered windows on the second floor yelling ``Yankee go home\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' as riot <b> police </b> ringed the building. U.S. Embassy officials said they had no reports of injuries, but the attackers smashed windows and set a <b> fire </b> in a periodical storage room. Thick smoke filled part of the <b> building </b> located in the heart of Seoul. People inside the <b> building </b> at the time of the attack, including at least one American, were not detained by the radicals. The students, who said they were members of the ``Young Student Suicide Group\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed at surrounding <b> police </b> to stay away. They tossed down a statement charging the United States was attempting to make South Korea a colony. ``Yankees stay out of Korea,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the <b> students </b> yelled. A <b> police </b> officer said it was unclear how many of the explosive devices the attackers had. The bombs were crude chemical devices, possibly some kind of plastic explosive, he said. About 200 radical <b> students </b> hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot <b> police </b> about an hour later outside Myungdong Cathedral. Police <b> fired </b> volleys of tear gas at the <b> students </b> who yelled slogans denouncing President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who is to be sworn in Thursday. Hundreds of <b> protesters </b> had gathered at the cathedral less than a mile from the U.S. Information Service office earlier in the afternoon for an anti-government protest. ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the <b> students </b> yelled. Some of the attackers were reading in the office\\textbackslash{}'s library when there was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenly pulled out bombs and started screaming slogans, eyewitnesses said. At least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it, they said. ``He was kind of crazy-eyed,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Paul Wadden, a visiting American teacher who was reading in the library at the time. The attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main street outside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the street and brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters. Riot <b> police </b> stood on the sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shattered glass covered the street. The <b> students </b> tossed at least one bomb into the street where it exploded harmlessly, eyewitnesses said. A second bomb was tossed out, but did not explode, they said. People caught in the library said the <b> students </b> did not attempt to detain them and they were able to leave after recovering from their initial shock. Wadden said he and other <b> people </b> were prevented from leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by <b> building </b> guards. There were about 40 <b> people </b> in the library at the time, most of them Koreans, eyewitnesses said. Police who entered the <b> building </b> by the rear entrance overpowered the <b> protesters </b> about 30 minutes after the attack began. The <b> students </b> were taken out of the <b> building </b> in a <b> bus </b> with covered windows. U.S. Embassy officials said South Korean riot <b> police </b> entered the <b> building </b> at their request. Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita arrived at the Lotte Hotel across the street from the U.S. Information Service office just as the incident ended, officials said. Takeshita is in Seoul for Roh\\textbackslash{}'s inauguration. American diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know why the <b> students </b> attacked the U.S. facility. ``We have no idea what the motivation was,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' an embassy official said. The United States is South Korea\\textbackslash{}'s chief ally. Washington has 40,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against communist North Korea. The U.S. Information Service provides reading material and other materials on the United States and operates libraries and information centers around the world in conjunction with American embassies. The service office in Seoul is located about half a mile from the American Embassy. The same office was seized by 73 radical <b> students </b> for four days in May, 1985 as an anti-American protest. They ended the occupation peacefully and some later received prison sentences. U.S. Embassy officials were unable to explain <b> today </b> how the attackers were able to bring weapons into the well-guarded building. Visitors must pass a metal detector, present identification and have their bags searched and there are <b> police </b> guards inside and outside. The statement by the <b> students </b> denounced Roh as a puppet who had been installed by the United States. South Korean radicals have repeatedly charged the United States has kept a series of authoritarian governments in power in South Korea.

The troup had been invited to perform by the government\\textbackslash{}'s culture club at the village. ``Around 250 Moslem fundamentalists from the village and nearby villages gathered in a mosque after evening prayers and then moved to the hall where the play was being performed, carrying stones and rocks,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the source said. He said the students, from a teacher training college, ``attacked the hall and tried to destroy the building,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' but <b> security </b> forces surrounded them and used tear gas and sticks to disperse them. He did not say whether <b> police </b> made any arrests. Police forces guarded the <b> building </b> until the play was finished, the source said. The southern Assiut province has been a hotbed of fundamentalist agitation for almost a decade. Fundamentalist <b> students </b> armed with knives, bicycle chains and stones, attacked an Assiut University campus parade on March 7, denouncing it as an anti-Islamic ``dancing and singing party.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In the ensuing clash with <b> security </b> forces, two <b> students </b> and two policemen were wounded. </p> 0.449178970764982  \\textbackslash{}n   Thousands marching against government austerity measures fled in panic Thursday when <b> police </b> <b> fired </b> rifles and tear gas after hooded youths smashed store windows. Three <b> people </b> were injured, <b> police </b> said. The <b> violence </b> came 11 months after rioting left about 300 dead following <b> protests </b> over subsidy cuts on food and public transportation. About 8,000 union members and supporters marched in the <b> capital </b> while thousands of others marched across the country in <b> protest </b> of government reforms aimed at cutting a \\$34 billion foreign debt, fourth-largest in Latin America. The march in Caracas was interrupted when a group of adolescents overturned garbage cans and shouted insults at police. About 20 of the youths began breaking windows in Simon Bolivar Center, a complex on Plaza Caracas, where the march was to end. Police rushed in firing tear gas and shotgun blasts in the air. Three <b> people </b> were <b> injured </b> in the brief confrontation, including Rafael Calma, a photographer for a Caracas newspaper, hit by a bottle thrown by a bystander in the crowd, said police. Police did not say how the other two <b> people </b> were hurt. ``It was the same group of troublemakers. A small group. We acted responsibly,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said metropolitan <b> police </b> sheriff L.B. Gomez, standing his ground as <b> protesters </b> chanted, ``Police off our streets! The <b> streets </b> are ours!\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``It\\textbackslash{}'s the fault of the government\\textbackslash{}'s economic package,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said a leftist congressman, Ricardo Guttierez, participating in the march. The march was called by the 4 million-member Confederation of Workers, CTV, Venezuela\\textbackslash{}'s largest umbrella labor group. The CTV has called on President Carlos Andres Perez to back off on austerity measures it says has hit poorer Venezuelans the hardest. Labor leaders have planned <b> protests </b> this month after Perez\\textbackslash{}' year-old Social Democratic government planned to cut subsidies on gasoline. The economy last year contracted by 8.1 percent and inflation rose to 80 percent under the effects of the austerity measures. Unemployment is about 11 percent, according to independent estimates, up from 8.7 percent last year. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  york san city los angeles california john francisco today washington robert william calif houston michael louis paul cities park baltimore </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.777615553462059  \\textbackslash{}n   101.

Federal prosecutors say Gerald M. Chernow, 49, and William M. Engelman, 52, cheated the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook by persuading maintenance engineer David Hilt to buy unneeded maintenance and roofing equipment that was marked up by up to 20 times its cost. Initially, Hilt was given merchandise, gift certificates and money orders, and later, his wife, Ellen, was put on the payroll of one of the Michigan companies, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Gleason said. Chernow and Engelman, both of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., entered innocent pleas before U.S. Magistrate David Cohen. Chernow and Engelman were freed on their own recognizance, but they must hand over their passports and will be required to pay \\$50,000 bond if they fail to show up to any court proceedings, Gleason said. The two businessmen had appeared in court without being arrested. The two are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and the use of interstate facilities in furtherance of private bribery. Both businessmen declined to comment on the case, as did defense attorney Julian Sweet of Lewiston. Also named as defendants in the 21-count indictment are Modern Research Corp. and Lincoln Technical Services Inc., both of Troy, Mich., and ABC Chemical Co. of Detroit.

Dissatisfaction in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has been fueled by political reforms proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Baltic residents say the changes will void their constitutional right to secede and give Moscow control over their <b> economy </b> and other aspects of life. The Politburo, the Communist Party\\textbackslash{}'s supreme body, promised Thursday to hold a discussion on expanding the rights of the 15 constituent Soviet republics. But the dispatching of three of its members to the Baltic region indicated the Kremlin wants to draw the line now on what sort of political changes can be contemplated. The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet parliament is to meet in special session in Moscow on Nov. 29 to approve Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s blueprint for political change, which also increases the powers of the presidential post and creates a new national legislature. Viktor M. Chebrikov, the former KGB chief who now heads a party Central Committee commission on legal and judicial reform, opposed demands for local <b> economic </b> independence in comments to workers at a plastics factory in Tallinn, Estonia, according to Tarmu Tammerk, an Estonian journalist. ``He said very strong words against <b> economic </b> independence. He said the whole of the Soviet <b> economy </b> is so tightly linked that one cannot speak of independence for one of its parts,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Tammerk, who works for the newspaper Homeland, said in a telephone interview. Chebrikov\\textbackslash{}'s remarks were broadcast on state-run Estonian radio in an attempt to give them the widest possible exposure. ``His words sounded like a grim warning to people here,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Tammerk said. ``Economic Independence\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' has been the watchword of a widespread movement in Estonia called the Popular Front, which seeks greater control by Estonians over the affairs of their Switzerland-sized republic. Estonians say the fruits of their labor are siphoned off by Moscow to subsidize poorer regions of the country, including the giant Russian federation, the largest Soviet republic. Two of Chebrikov\\textbackslash{}'s colleagues on the Politburo traveled to the other Baltic states, ideology chief Vadim M. Medvedev to Latvia and Nikolai N. Slyunkov, who is in charge of formulating the party\\textbackslash{}'s social and <b> economic </b> policy, to Lithuania. Their arrivals were reported by state-run media in the Baltic republics, journalists there said. Later, the evening television news <b> program </b> Vremya broadcast brief reports on the visits. Tass, the official news agency, said Medvedev outlined limits to political activity in meetings with workers at two factories in Riga, the Latvian capital. Tass said Latvians agreed with Medvedev on the need ``to subordinate group ambitions to the interests of society as a whole in the conditions of perestroika.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' However, during his visit to the Norma factory in Tallinn, Chebrikov heard Estonians object to elements of Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s political <b> reform </b> plan, Vremya said. The westward-looking Baltic republics, independent states until the Soviet Union absorbed them in 1940, have become a proving ground for bold <b> economic </b> reforms that are part of Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s drive for ``perestroika\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' or restructuring. Granting a greater degree of autonomy to the small <b> republics </b> on the Soviet Union\\textbackslash{}'s western edge is fraught with political risks, since many residents resent Moscow\\textbackslash{}'s control and some openly say their ultimate desire is complete independence. The Estonian Popular Front and a similar organization in Latvia have condemned Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s political <b> reform </b> plan, which is embodied in proposed amendments to the 1977 Constitution. The Lithuanian Restructuring Movement is to meet Sunday in Vilnius, the republic\\textbackslash{}'s capital, to consider the issue. Members of the three popular fronts are now gathering signatures on petitions asking that the amendments be dropped and rewritten, Algimontas Vaishnoras of the Lithuanian group said in a telephone interview. The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, has scheduled a meeting on the political <b> reform </b> issue for Wednesday, and Lithuania\\textbackslash{}'s legislature will meet the next day. The 12-man Politburo, in a report on its Thursday night meeting, said authorities will consider changing the draft constitutional changes in response to more than 80,000 suggestions and comments from citizens and organizations. Friday night the Central Committee announced it would hold a special plenary meeting in mid-1989 to review policies dealing with the country\\textbackslash{}'s more than 100 ethnic groups. ``The task of perfecting relations among nationalities is acquiring special importance and urgency,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' a Central Committee statement said according to Tass. </p> 0.40124004566598  \\textbackslash{}n   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday night closed a national Communist Party <b> conference </b> on his <b> program </b> of ``perestroika,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' saying resolutions endorsed by the delegates lead the way to a ``democratic image of socialism.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The four-day conference, the first held by the party since 1941, was unprecedented in the openness of criticism of past and present leaders. Gorbachev pointed out one key to the four-day <b> conference </b> \\_ the attempt to overcome the party\\textbackslash{}'s Stalinist legacy \\_ when he called for construction of a monument to the victims Josef Stalin. ``I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be constructed in Moscow,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said in his closing address. ``This would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire Soviet people.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gorbachev spoke after the <b> conference </b> of 5,000 party members adopted resolutions in what the Tass news agency called an ``unusually stormy and long\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' debate. The meeting, which was called by Gorbachev to pass judgment on his 3-year-old policy of restructuring Soviet society, formally closed after his address. The Soviet <b> leader </b> also engaged in a long critique of the work of former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, who appealed earlier in the day to the <b> conference </b> to absolve him of blame for criticizing the pace of Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s reforms last fall. That criticism cost Yeltsin his job and his spot as a candidate member of the ruling Politburo. Summing up the work of the conference, Gorbachev said, ``Through democratization, <b> economic </b> <b> reform </b> and changes in the political system we willmake perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our society, a new human and democratic image of socialism.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He called for the policy-making Central Committee and other organs to urgently settle questions related to political reforms so they can begin to be implemented at a fall session of the Supreme Soviet. Referring to his proposals to restructure the government\\textbackslash{}'s legislative branch and give the president new powers, Gorbachev said ``the <b> conference </b> will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Tass said the <b> conference </b> adopted a package of six resolutions, saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations and Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s policy of ``glasnost,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' or more openness, were particularly thorny. It did not say what the resolutions said. The Tass report said there were several votes on amendments, and that the <b> conference </b> rejected proposals by space scientist Roald Sagdeyev on elections to government councils. An amendment calling for the Communist Party newspaper Pravda to be taken out of the hands of the policy-making Central Committee received only 56 votes, it said. Gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference. ``One of the heroes of our <b> conference </b> was glasnost because our <b> conference </b> was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. He called on the Soviet media to ``publicize the real achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and proclaimed that no one has a monopoly on the truth. In an apparent reference to the time of Stalin, he said ``the printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In contrast, he said the <b> conference </b> had showed how the interparty debate must be carried out. Before the <b> conference </b> debate ended, however, the long-simmering feud between Yeltsin and Kremlin No. 2 <b> leader </b> Yegor K. Ligachev broke into the open. Yeltsin was judged as being politically mistaken by the party, but he said Friday his only mistake was poor timing. Gorbachev said Yeltsin was chosen to run the Moscow party organization because of his experience and energy, but ultimately proved he could not handle the job. Ligachev, at whom much of Yeltsin\\textbackslash{}'s criticism was leveled, took the floor Friday evening to oppose his return, saying Yeltsin committed many errors and still hadn\\textbackslash{}'t learned his lesson. The 57-year-old Yeltsin, a leading reformer and former protege of Gorbachev, was fired from his Moscow job as head of the Moscow Communist Party after he attacked the slow pace of <b> reform </b> during a speech in October to the Central Committee. The speech has not been published. Yeltsin was reassigned as first deputy of the state construction committee, a ministerial-level post. He was dropped from the Politburo in February but retained sufficient status in the party to be chosen a delegate. ``I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early, before the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Yeltsin said. It was a time when the party was trying to display unity and celebrate its successes. ``Taking to heart what happened, I ask the <b> conference </b> to change the decision of the plenum of the Central Committee,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Yeltsin told the delegates. ``If you find it possible to do this, you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of Communists.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Yeltsin took the floor to answer questions from many delegates about the circumstances of his ouster and about his demand that Ligachev resign. He had told Western reporters during the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow that Ligachev was the party official most responsible for holding back Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s reforms. Ligachev said Yeltsin had ``not drawn the necessary conclusions from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Other delegates also criticized Yeltsin, charging that he had been tactless on a visit abroad and gave interviews to foreign new agencies just to boost his own prestige. Some rose to Yeltsin\\textbackslash{}'s defense in an open debate. Earlier Friday, the nation\\textbackslash{}'s top environmental official demanded punishment for planners responsible for pollution disasters, and a reformist publisher defended the new openness of the press. At other times during the conference, delegates have openly disagreed on the concrete results of Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s drive for perestroika, which was launched after he took power in March 1985. </p> 0.354439941714667  \\textbackslash{}n   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has won another political victory, gaining Communist Party approval to restructure the Politburo that once ruled the country. The Politburo now promises to play second fiddle to the separate government structure he also leads. The vote by the 28th Communist Party Congress on Monday also marks a new effort to reduce the ethnic unrest that is tearing the Soviet Union apart by including party leaders from the 15 Soviet <b> republics </b> on the Politburo, the party\\textbackslash{}'s ruling inner circle. The new body will have up to 23 members, nearly twice the 12 voting members on the old body, and many if not most of the faces should be new. The expansion and restructuring will accelerate the process that Gorbachev began after he was elected to a strengthened presidency in March, transferring power to a newly created Presidential Council \\_ a development that has angered such hard-line Politburo members as Yegor K. Ligachev and could squeeze them out of their jobs. Unlike the Politburo, whose members are elected by the party, members of the Presidential Council are appointed and dismissed by the president, along the lines of a Western-style cabinet. The Politburo, which formerly met once every Thursday, has been meeting only once a month since March, and has been concentrating on Communist Party rather than government issues. Since most of the Politburo members will reside in their home republics, the Politburo will continue to meet relatively infrequently and will not exercise as tight control over national affairs as the body has traditionally done. The duties of the government council have not been fully defined. The 16-man body consists of six voting members of the Politburo, including the prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister, the KGB chief, and Gorbachev\\textbackslash{}'s right-hand man, Alexander Yakovlev. Other members are the chief law enforcement official, a reform-minded economist, a crusading environmentalist and a workers\\textbackslash{}' rights activist. Significantly, whereas nine of 12 men on the old Politburo were members of the ethnic Russian majority, the new Politburo will include a majority of non-Russians. And the Presidential Council contains five non-Russians. The new Politburo will include the heads of the party organizations in the 15 republics, most of whom are clamoring for greater control over political and <b> economic </b> decisions affecting their regions. Shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist Party five years ago, Gorbachev sought to centralize his authority, but he has been driven to support greater regional autonomy by the independence drives of the three Baltic republics. Moreover, the largest Soviet republic, the Russian Federation, last month proclaimed its intent to seek greater control of its affairs under the leadership of its populist Communist president, Boris N. Yeltsin. Mostly recently, Gorbachev has embraced the idea of reconstituting the Soviet Union as a looser confederation of republics. The Politburo has had its ups and downs since it was created on the eve of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that swept the Communists to power. The first two Soviet leaders, Vladimir I. Lenin and Josef V. Stalin, exercised virtual one man rule, appointing aides and allies to the Politburo. Under Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled for 18 years until his death in 1982, the Politburo was a coalition that made all the key decisions. As Brezhnev and the other Politburo members weakened with age, the country lapsed into what Gorbachev has labeled the period of stagnation. The first Politburo consisted of seven Bolsheviks, among them Lenin, the founder of the Red Army Leon Trotsky, and the lesser-known Stalin. Following Lenin\\textbackslash{}'s death in 1924, Stalin eliminated Trotsky and other rivals from the ruling body. By the height of his power in 1952, he had expanded the membership to 25 voting members, all loyal aides. It also included 11 non-voting members. Nikita S. Khrushchev, who rose to power after Stalin\\textbackslash{}'s death in 1953, whittled the body to 15 voting and nine non-voting members. Although he instituted reforms, he tried to keep a tight personal grip on power, angering Politburo colleagues who tried unsuccessfully to oust him in 1957 and succeeded in 1964. Brezhnev, Khrushchev\\textbackslash{}'s successor, used the Politburo to forge a coalition among Soviet interest groups, such as the armed forces, the KGB, other government ministries and major industrial sectors, who held most of the dozen slots. He also included seven heads of <b> republic </b> parties as non-voting Politburo members, allowing them to run their regions in return for loyalty. Gorbachev and his allies argue that Brezhnev\\textbackslash{}'s system led to widescale corruption and blocked the transformation of the country into a modern industrial society. </p> 0.35324437702244  \\textbackslash{}n   Lithuania on Saturday proposed that its parliament compromise with the Kremlin and impose a moratorium on its declaration of independence, officials said. The proposal from the republic\\textbackslash{}'s Council of Ministers appeared to coincide with a compromise offered Tuesday by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the official news agency Tass said it ``could mark the beginning of the solution of all the so-called `Lithuanian problems.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Also Saturday, Soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a fertilizer plant in Lithuania, partly easing the 2-month-old blockade of fuel they imposed to pressure the Baltic <b> republic </b> into renouncing its March 11 declaration of independence. The Lithuanian government suggested the declaration remain valid but its implementation be frozen while negotiations were under way with Moscow, said Algis Cekuolis, a consultant for the Baltic republic. However, Cekuolis said it was unclear whether the compromise would have enough support to be passed by the republic\\textbackslash{}'s legislature, which will probably consider it Monday. ``It will be received in parliament by very strong opposition,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he predicted. The Lithuanian government, under Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, is considered far more disposed to compromise with the Kremlin than the parliament, which is led by President Vytautas Landsbergis and dominated by members of the pro-independence Sajudis popular front. Gorbachev proposed compromises Tuesday in a meeting with the leaders of the three secessionist Baltic states. He told the national Supreme Soviet legislature earlier that day that ``if Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of independence, we may start to talk. That means suspend its implementation at least for the duration of the talks.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Saturday\\textbackslash{}'s proposal by the Lithuanian Council of Ministers suggested exactly that, government spokesmen said. ``Our act of independence would remain valid,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said council spokesman Gentaras Jatkonis. ``But we are postponing the realization of it.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Similar proposals have gone back and forth between the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius and Moscow in telegrams and informal talks ``like a ping-pong game\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for weeks but ``this is the first time it\\textbackslash{}'s on an official level,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Cekuolis said. A spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament, Aidas Palubinskas, said he was told on Saturday by a pipeline dispatcher that natural gas was again flowing from the Soviet Union to the Azotas fertilizer plant in the city of Jonova. ``The plant will be getting 3.5 million cubic meters daily,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Palubinskas was told by dispatcher Alexander Mishikov. Restoration of the gas supply fulfilled a promise made to Mrs. Prunskiene on Wednesday by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov that 15 percent of the republic\\textbackslash{}'s daily natural gas supply would be restored. Politburo member Yuri D. Maslyukov told a news <b> conference </b> in Moscow on Friday that the restoration of fuel to the Lithuanian plant was a goodwill gesture from the Kremlin and a ``reiteration of the Soviet government\\textbackslash{}'s interest in speeding negotiations.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' More than 26,000 people have lost their jobs because of the Kremlin\\textbackslash{}'s blockade of all oil, most natural gas and some raw materials. Palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the Azotas plant would mean 1,600 employees could return to work by the end of this week. At the beachfront resort of Jurmala in Latvia, leaders of the popular fronts of Latvia and Estonia and the Sajudis movement of Lithuania opened a <b> conference </b> to discuss the future of their movements under democratically elected governments. The delegates, 50 from each of the pro-independence movements, condemned the <b> economic </b> sanctions against Lithuania and discussed ways of increasing cooperation among the Baltic states and with other Soviet republics, Tass reported. ``Nobody has a right to demand either abrogation or halting the acts of independence,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Tass quoted delegates as saying. ``A retreat will harm the democratic movement.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.351544221361977  \\textbackslash{}n   Thousands of people went on strike in the capital of Armenia, apparently unhappy over the Armenian leadership\\textbackslash{}'s presentation of an ethnic dispute at the national Communist Party conference, a newspaper said Tuesday. The Soviet government daily Izvestia said the strike began Monday, one day after ``many thousands\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of people met in the Theater Square of Yerevan, the capital of the southern republic. Most flights in and out of Yerevan were canceled, it said. In a Tuesday edition, Izvestia said: ``Like yesterday a series of the city\\textbackslash{}'s industrial concerns aren\\textbackslash{}'t working, or are working with less than a full work force.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' It said food stores and industries, as well as restaurants and medical services had been working Monday. The newspaper said farm work was going on in Stepanakert, the largest city of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, but that many other industries and institutions there also were shut down. Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of a territorial dispute between Armenia and the neighboring <b> republic </b> of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but the mountain enclave\\textbackslash{}'s predominantly Armenian population has been agitating since February to be annexed to Armenia. Armenia supports the demand. Azerbaijan is against it. At least 32 people were killed in riots over annexation which broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, at the end of February. Izvestia said the thousands of people who gathered on the Yerevan city square Sunday listened to a television broadcast by delegates to the four-day party <b> conference </b> in Moscow, which closed last Friday. Armenian party <b> leader </b> Suren Arutyunyan said in remarks broadcast on Soviet TV during the <b> conference </b> that authorities could not normalize the situation in Armenia, where large demonstrations frequently have occurred in support of Nagorno-Karabakh\\textbackslash{}'s demand. He proposed that the <b> conference </b> take up unspecified amendments to the Soviet constitution. The disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan has sent the issue to national authorities, and the constitution specifies no way to solve the dispute. Delegates who spoke on television supported Arutyunyan\\textbackslash{}'s call for restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd. But Izvestia said that after a ``stormy debate\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on the square, a committee was formed that called for a general strike after laying down a series of demands, including a quick, favorable resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The committee demanded that the Soviet Supreme Court take over the trials of those charged in the Sumgait violence and demanded full information about the alleged poisoning of workers at a factory in the town of Masis. Izvestia provided no more information about the Masis incident, except to say an investigation was under way. The party <b> conference </b> called for greater attention to republics\\textbackslash{}' calls for <b> economic </b> autonomy, but said authorities would not tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic tensions. Besides Azerbaijan and Armenia, delegates from the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also brought up ethnic questions at the conference. About a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three Estonian political prisoners had gathered more than 6,000 signatures by Tuesday during a five-day demonstration in Tallinn, Estonia. ``We will continue the demonstration until they are freed or until the authorities give us an exact date for their release,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Eve Parnaste said as she carried a poster at the protest outside the Estonian Supreme Court building. She said the three prisoners had been demanding publication of a secret 1939 pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that placed the Baltic <b> republics </b> of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia under Moscow\\textbackslash{}'s control. All three were arrested this year, charged with spreading anti-Soviet propaganda or slandering the Soviet state.

The United States is engaged in a collective effort involving the overwhelming majority of the member states of the United Nations to reverse the consequences of Iraqi aggression. And our goals, enshrined in five Security Council resolutions, are clear: the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of Kuwait\\textbackslash{}'s legitimate government, the stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, and the protection of American citizens. What is at stake here is truly significant \\_ the dependability of America\\textbackslash{}'s commitments to its friends and allies, the shape of the post-postwar world, opposition to aggression, the potential domination of the energy resources that are crucial to the entire world. This effort has been truly international from the very outset. Many other countries are contributing. At last count, 22 countries have either responded to a request from Saudi Arabia to help deter further aggression, or are contributing maritime forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 665. And still others are providing other forms of financial and material <b> support </b> to these defense efforts or to countries whose economies are affected adversely by sanctions or by higher oil prices. And still others are paying a heavy economic price at home for complying with the United Nations sanctions. It is <b> important </b> that the considerable burden of the effort be shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free flow of oil. Indeed, anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in ensuring that all of us succeed. The United States has large interests in the balance and has undertaken commitments commensurate with them, and we\\textbackslash{}'re more than willing to bear our fair share of the burden. This includes above all the thousands of men and women in our armed forces who are now in the Gulf, but we also expect others to bear their fair share. A number of countries already have announced their willingness to help those adversely affected economically by this endeavor. And it\\textbackslash{}'s essential, though, that this be a concerted and coordinated one and that all affected countries participate. It is <b> important </b> to get the priorities right and make sure that those most deserving of assistance receive it and that those most able to contribute do so. And for that reason, I directed an interagency effort to develop a strategy to accomplish this objective. The group\\textbackslash{}'s report was presented at yesterday\\textbackslash{}'s National Security Council meeting here, and this morning I approved an <b> action </b> plan. And our approach calls for substantial economic assistance to those states \\_ in particular, I\\textbackslash{}'d single out Turkey and Egypt, who are bearing a great <b> part </b> of the burden of sanctions and higher oil prices. The <b> plan </b> also targets additional countries, including Jordan, the countries of Eastern Europe and others for <b> special </b> assistance. The United States will also seek burdensharing for <b> part </b> of our own effort. At the same time, we will be asking other governments, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Federal Republic of Germany, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, free Kuwait, and others to join us in making available financial and, where appropriate, energy resources to countries that have been most affected by the current situation. To facilitate this undertaking, I\\textbackslash{}'ve asked Secretary of State Jim Baker and the Secretary of the Treasury Nick Brady to lead high-level delegations to the Persian Gulf, Europe and Asia. And I\\textbackslash{}'ll be getting directly in touch with the leaders of these countries before Secretaries Baker and Brady arrive to set forth, spell out our general objectives. Let me close by repeating what I said the other day in meeting with the congressional leaders. The basic pieces of our <b> policy </b> are in place. The Iraqi regime stands in opposition to the entire world and to the interests of the Iraqi people. It is truly Iraq against the world. But I want to make this point clear, we have no argument with the people of Iraq. The sanctions are beginning to take hold. And in the meantime, we want to ensure that countries contributing to this unprecedented collective response do not suffer for doing so. And what I\\textbackslash{}'ve announced today and what I expect will be implemented in the coming days should help create a context in which sanctions against Iraq can be sustained with the intended effect. Another area where there has been unprecedented international solidarity is OPEC\\textbackslash{}'s willingness to take up the slack in oil production created by the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwait\\textbackslash{}'s oil. In this connection, I met this morning with our energy advisers who are watching the oil production <b> situation </b> very, very closely. And we are pleased with OPEC\\textbackslash{}'s decision to help take up the slack in crude oil production. And although we are in what I would see as a transition period, the <b> situation </b> appears manageable. At the present time, we don\\textbackslash{}'t anticipate <b> major </b> imbalances in the oil market. But we do have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve tested and available if it is truly needed. And our energy <b> policy </b> is resulting in increased oil production and fuel switching to natural gas and to other fuels. I also repeat my previous request for Americans to conserve and for all parties to act responsibly. Right now, the situation, I would say, is relative stable, and I am very pleased by the coordination that has taken place with so many countries in maintaining adequate fuel levels.

The European Community and its member states have consistently followed developments in South Africa with the greatest attention and have given a favorable reception to the initiatives which have been to bring about the abolition of apartheid and the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. They have already expressed approval of the results of the talks between the government and the ANC (African National Congress), in particular those of the Pretoria meeting in August which opened the way to the negotiation of a new constitution. They deplore the phase of serious violence through which South Africa is passing, which may endanger these developments. They welcome, however, further indications serving to confirm that the process of <b> change </b> already begun is going ahead in the direction advocated by the Strasbourg European Council. They have decided to continue to encourage this process. Against this background, the European Council has decided that as soon as legislative <b> action </b> is taken by the African government to repeal the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, the Community and its member states will proceed to an easing of the set of measures adopted in 1986. As of now, so as to contribute to combating unemployment and improving the economic and social <b> situation </b> in South Africa, and to encourage the movement under way aimed at the complete abolition of apartheid, the European Council has decided to lift the ban on new investments. At the same time, the Community and its member states, with the objective of sending a clear message of political <b> support </b> to the victims of apartheid, and intending to contribute to a new economic and social balance in South Africa, have agreed to strengthen the program of positive measures and to adapt it to the requirements of the new situation, including requirements related to the return and resettlement of the exiles. The Community and its member states hope in this way to be able to contribute to the speeding up of the process under way through sending to all the parties involved in negotiations a concrete sign of <b> support </b> for the establishment of a new South Africa, united, non-racial and democratic and capable of resuming the place which it deserves in the international community. </p> 0.272641028930976  \\textbackslash{}n   The Federal Communications Commission has decided to relax its rule on ownership of more than one radio station.

The FCC said the new rule will enable more station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that result from common ownership of stations. The FCC also agreed to recommend that Congress require cable companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights to carry their signals.

Now a band of ``reverse archaeologists\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' wants to bring them home. Before Congress outlawed the practice in 1905, collecting baskets, pots, tools and other everyday household items from Anasazi Indian ruins was a thrilling romp through history for explorers hired by East Coast collectors. Like the swashbuckling treasure hunter in the ``Indiana Jones\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' movies, they took the ancient ruins of a culture that vanished before Europeans reached the New World. Most of the loot eventually found its way into <b> museum </b> display cases. Large collections are housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Museum of the American Indian in New York, among others. But a group of volunteer researchers is eager to bring them home to the Four Corners area of the Southwest where the Anasazi pioneered farming and <b> built </b> dense communities hundreds of feet high in scenic cliffsides. Julia Johnson, the director of the volunteer Wetherill-Grand Gulch researchers, decried the looting at a recent symposium on the early Anasazis, known as the Basketmakers, in Blanding, Utah. The group wants to reverse the actions of 1890s explorers and return the <b> artifacts </b> to museums as close to the ruins from which they were taken as possible. To help achieve that and to help scientists study the Anasazi, 5,000 pages of documents and 500 photographs have been compiled on the <b> museum </b> <b> artifacts </b> to trace their origins. Since many of the early-day explorers kept meticulous diaries, ``it\\textbackslash{}'s possible in some cases to identify exactly which hole something came out of,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Fred Blackburn, a biologist who joined the ``reverse archaeologists.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Blackburn, 40, and his colleagues crawl through Grand Gulch in Utah, about 100 miles west of Cortez, searching for signatures the explorers carved into cliff walls. By matching the individual <b> artifacts </b> on display in Eastern museums with the diaries, Blackburn\\textbackslash{}'s group can supply a research base for scientists studying the Basketmaker era of the Anasazi, he said. The ruins were virtually cleared out and their treasures carted off by the time Congress forbade the practice in 1905, Blackburn said. ``And the expeditions weren\\textbackslash{}'t real researchers,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Blackburn, whose wife, Victoria Atkins, is an archaeologist. ``There\\textbackslash{}'s so much we don\\textbackslash{}'t know about the Basketmakers.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Basketmaker Anasazis lived in the area from about the time of Christ until the year 700, Blackburn said. They are believed to be the farming pioneers of the tribe that <b> built </b> a thriving civiliation in the famous cliff houses of Mesa Verde National Park. Their Pueblo Anasazi descendants disappeared from the area, apparently driven by a long drought, in about 1300. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re putting this together so researchers can go back and find out what the origins of these people were, their customs, where they came from and where they went,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Blackburn said. He started with the diary of Charles Cary Graham, who with Charles McLoyd began excavating Grand Gulch in 1890. The pair met Richard Wetherill and Charlie Mason just as the latter two were riding out after discovering the landmark Balcony House at Mesa Verde. Wetherill, a nearby rancher and amateur archaeologist, hired Graham and McLoyd to bring <b> artifacts </b> from Grand Gulch to the local historical society. The collection later ended up at the Field Museum in Chicago. As news of the rich ruins spread, other expeditions followed, explorers erasing clues to the mysterious Anasazi\\textbackslash{}'s past in their diligence to gather prized artifacts. One likely <b> site </b> for any relics returned to the region would be the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores, a town north of Cortez. Initial efforts will try to arrange artifact loans, with the eventual goal of establishing permanent exhibits, volunteers said. Fund-raising is under way to pay for lobbying visits to museums that house large Anasazi collections. Blackburn, who specializes in studies of Bighorn sheep, says his strong ties to the Four Corners area prompted his ``reverse archaeology\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' work. He\\textbackslash{}'s especially fascinated with evidence of the Anasazis ability to co-exist with the sheep that used to roam the area in large numbers. The fledgling ``reverse archaeolgist\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' movement \\_ looking for <b> artifacts </b> in museums to bring them back to historic sites, rather than the other way around \\_could provide clues to true archaeologists enabling them to unravel the mystery surrounding the demise of the Anasazi, he said. ``Archaeology is really pretty new here in southwest Colorado,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``And there hasn\\textbackslash{}'t been much done on the Basketmakers. ``There are a lot of parallels between the Anasazi and what we have today. Overpopulation and drought were a major problem for them and many archaeologists think that\\textbackslash{}'s what drove them out of here. Overpopulation and drought are big problems for us, too.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.469916214218051  \\textbackslash{}n   A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and nondescript. Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office <b> building </b> planned for downtown Atlanta. Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the 50-story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is a slender, post-modern <b> tower </b> of stone with tall arched entryways and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high, eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern. Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words like ``gracious,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``truly wonderful,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``serene,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``imposing\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``glamorous\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to describe the tower. ``It certainly <b> projects </b> a vibrance to the rest of the world,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development with the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s just beautiful. Everybody\\textbackslash{}'s just staggered by it.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The <b> tower </b> is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of the city\\textbackslash{}'s tallest buildings. Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going up in Atlanta, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper complex was altered to complement the rose-colored IBM tower. New York architect John Burgee, whose firm designed the IBM <b> building </b> with design consultant Philip Johnson, won\\textbackslash{}'t take credit for transforming Atlanta\\textbackslash{}'s skyline. But he said the city\\textbackslash{}'s image, as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change. ``Atlanta has been looking for its identity,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Burgee said in a telephone interview from his New York office. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s an historical city (but) its architecture and image is not strictly historical. You think of Atlanta and you think of `Gone With The Wind.\\textbackslash{}' Now, there is an attempt to come up with a visual image. ``We all know Peachtree Street, but you don\\textbackslash{}'t think of its buildings,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``Like in New York, the Empire State Building; Chicago, the Sears building; San Francisco, the TransAmerica building. Atlanta doesn\\textbackslash{}'t have that. It\\textbackslash{}'s moving toward that, very definitely.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Burgee and Johnson also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown Atlanta. Another planned <b> project </b> grouped in the ``Son of IBM\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' <b> building </b> spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section, a complex of three office <b> buildings </b> and a <b> hotel </b> being developed by AT\\&T and the Atlanta-based Landmarks Group. When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the excitement over the nearby IBM Tower, its architects, Thompson, Ventulett \\& Stainback, redrew the plans to use rose glass above rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire. The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by Portman, whose imprint is already deeply felt in Atlanta, primarily through the Peachtree Center and the towering cylindrical Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. Portman\\textbackslash{}'s new <b> building </b> is slated to begin <b> construction </b> next year and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One Atlantic as the Southeast\\textbackslash{}'s tallest building. Unveiling the design in May, Portman said it was ``respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold and forward-looking \\_ the beginning of post-post-modern architecture.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dale Durfee, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech, said completion of the IBM <b> tower </b> signaled the acceleration of a change in the look of the city that began a decade ago. ``Atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said, ``with no development of architectural significance.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Burgee echoed that appraisal, saying, ``It was pretty nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you (to Atlanta) blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t have a clue where you are.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Durfee said that 10 years ago, Atlanta was groping to form an identity and had no demand for the type of <b> buildings </b> now are going up. Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office buildings, Durfee said, and corporate sponsorship of <b> building </b> <b> projects </b> has changed the rules of skyscraper financing. Some say that all the <b> building </b> activity simply makes good business sense. ``Sure, there\\textbackslash{}'s competitive prestige. Good architecture is good business,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Truman Hartshorn, chairman of the geography department at Georgia State University and a specialist in urban affairs. A good-looking building, he said, ``is easier to sell to the financing people as well as the tenants.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Hartshorn said he expects the new <b> projects </b> in Atlanta will bring special recognition. ``I think it\\textbackslash{}'s going to open some eyes,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``We have prestige with our cultural buildings, but I don\\textbackslash{}'t know that our office <b> buildings </b> are that distinctive nationally. ``These aren\\textbackslash{}'t just ultra post-modern.

To make matters worse, burial plots are running out. Most cemeteries, where single plots can <b> cost </b> \\$1,000 and more, are likely to be filled within 10 or 15 years, according to funeral home and cemetery managers. ``Cemeteries are going to become a thing of the past,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said William E. Magner Jr., who manages Willowbrook Cemetery in Westport. Harriet Steuber, president of a group that administers Union Cemetery of Norwalk, said that once <b> space </b> runs out, ``I guess we\\textbackslash{}'ll all have to be cremated and dumped in the sound,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' referring to Long Island Sound, the stretch of ocean off the Connecticut coast. ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t like to think about it.

Construction of one such facility by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport began this month at Darien\\textbackslash{}'s St. John\\textbackslash{}'s Cemetery. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s one of the, shall we say, contemporary modes of burial to help meet the lack of space,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Monsignor Nicholas B. Grieco. The structures are often multistory units containing hallways lined with crypts. Each floor might contain up to 100 bodies. ``Think of it as a giant bookcase with slots,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Magner said. But mausoleums are not cost-savers. They are generally more expensive than below-ground burial, Grieco said. Other cemetery managers say mausoleum interment is about twice the price of traditional burial. Sometimes it\\textbackslash{}'s possible to economize. At St. John\\textbackslash{}'s Cemetery in Norwalk, a two-grave plot can be used for four individuals \\_ one on top of another. The practice is allowed at the discretion of the cemetery, which charges \\$1,050 for the double plots. But the <b> cost </b> of the grave <b> site </b> is only the start. Add to that payments to the cemetery for digging the grave and the price of a concrete vault, plus a foundation for a gravestone and it could <b> cost </b> as much as \\$2,000. Cremation, which one local funeral director said now accounts for about 30 percent of his business, can save several hundred dollars at the funeral home and there would be no cemetery costs. Basic cremation and transporation services can <b> cost </b> as little as \\$160. </p> 0.431739320901043  \\textbackslash{}n   One of the last persons to receive a Jarvik artifical <b> heart </b> before federal <b> approval </b> of the <b> device </b> was withdrawn died after surgery to replace the pump with a donor organ. He spent 87 days on the device. Carl E. Bryant, 43, of Louisville, died Wednesday, eight hours after the transplant operation, said doctors at Louisville\\textbackslash{}'s Jewish Hospital. ``We did everything we could for Carl Bryant,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Dr. Laman A. Gray Jr., who transplanted the heart. Physicians said the donor heart, which became available late Tuesday, met the criteria for transplantation. But the left ventricle, or main pumping chamber, failed to function once the <b> heart </b> was inside Bryant. The Jarvik 7-70 assist <b> device </b> was implanted Dec. 22 at Humana Hospital-Audubon by Dr. William DeVries, who pioneered use of the artificial heart. ``The transplant surgery offered Carl\\textbackslash{}'s only real chance for survival,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' DeVries said in a statement Wednesday. Bryant was the second-to-last person to receive a Jarvik pump in this country before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew its <b> approval </b> of the <b> device </b> Jan. 8, said Gary Cole, an executive vice president with Symbion Inc., the Arizona manufacturer of the pumps. The agency said its inspections uncovered ``serious deficiencies\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in the way Symbion was carrying out studies with the device. In February, the FDA said it would allow use of the <b> device </b> as a last resort, but only when all other available treatments had failed and when no other life-saving <b> device </b> could be used. The <b> device </b> was last implanted in the United States in Columbus, Ohio, on Dec. 31, Cole said Thursday. He said two Jarvik pumps have been implanted in other countries since the FDA withdrawal. Cole said 159 Jarviks have been implanted as bridges to transplants since 1985. He said the longest-surviving patient to use the Jarvik while awaiting a donor organ was a French woman. She lived 603 days on the device. Dr. Barney Clark, the first person implanted with a Jarvik heart, died in 1983 after 112 days on the device. He received a Jarvik-7, which was supposed to be a premanent replacement for his heart. Bryant had a massive <b> heart </b> attack in July and underwent cardiac catheterization and angioplastic surgery in his left coronary artery. His wife, Cynthia, took him to the hospital Dec. 16 after he complained of chest pains. Three hours before he was to undergo triple bypass surgery, Bryant suffered a second massive <b> heart </b> attack. DeVries implanted the Jarvik <b> device </b> during a six-hour procedure. ``I have no qualms about Carl being on the assist <b> device </b> at all,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Cynthia Bryant said. ``It worked wonderfully and may further research to help someone else. And we had three good months together that we would not have had otherwise.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.428420640878955  \\textbackslash{}n   Proponents of artificial hearts fear the Food and Drug Administration\\textbackslash{}'s withdrawal of <b> approval </b> for the Jarvik <b> heart </b> could hurt research toward a totally implantable device, but most see it as a temporary setback. And they don\\textbackslash{}'t believe the action will have a serious impact on <b> heart </b> patients because other temporary heart-assist devices still are available as a bridge to a <b> heart </b> transplant. ``It is a shame because the Jarvik, for its limitation, did make some positive contributions,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Dr. Antonio Gotto, chief of internal medical services at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and past president of the American Heart Association. ``I hope this will be only a temporary, not a permanent, setback toward the goal of achieving a totally implantable heart.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The FDA informed Symbion Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., this week that it was withdrawing <b> approval </b> for continued investigational uses of its artificial heart, both as a permanent replacement and a temporary bridge for patients awaiting a human <b> heart </b> transplant. The Jarvik heart, named after its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik, gained household recognition after it was implanted in Barney Clark on Dec. 2, 1982. He lived 112 days, his new <b> heart </b> tethered to a bulky external power system, before he succumbed to multiple organ failure. In revoking Symbion\\textbackslash{}'s approval, the FDA said it had found ``serious deficiencies\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in manufacturing quality control, monitoring of research sites, servicing of equipment, training of personnel and reporting of adverse reactions to FDA. Dr. Donald Olsen, director of the University of Utah\\textbackslash{}'s Institute for Biomedical Engineering, said he was ``surprised and disappointed\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' by the FDA\\textbackslash{}'s action and hoped it would not hurt future federal funding of artificial <b> heart </b> research in general, particularly for totally implantable devices. ``Our concern, of course, is that this particular publicity will not have a negative influence\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on artificial <b> heart </b> development in general, said Olsen. ``But I would like to make sure (people know) that the artificial <b> heart </b> did not fail; it was a failure on the part of Symbion to meet the requirements of the FDA\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for improving the device. Gerson Rosenberg, a biomedical engineer who leads Pennsylvania State University\\textbackslash{}'s efforts to design an electric heart, said he did not think the decision to pull the Jarvik would hinder research. But others felt the decision could slow research in the field. ``By removing the Jarvik, you take the first and main artificial <b> heart </b> player out of the ballgame,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Dr. Jacob Kolff, who heads Temple University\\textbackslash{}'s efforts to develop the temporary ``Philadelphia Heart.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``That leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think there may be a future for an artificial heart,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said the surgeon, whose father, Dr. Willem Kolff, developed the first artificial kidney in 1943. Withdrawal of the permanent Jarvik <b> heart </b> leaves only one other natural-heart replacement with FDA investigational approval, but that <b> device </b> is used only as a temporary bridge and only at Hershey Medical Center of Penn State. Other companies have approvals for temporary implants and for left ventricular assist pumps that help the natural <b> heart </b> work without replacement. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  market stock index exchange trading points stocks rose jones shares million dow average issues volume wall york unchanged board big </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.866173563713779  \\textbackslash{}n   The Dow Jones <b> average </b> of 30 industrials closed down 13.29 <b> points </b> to 2,583.56.

On the first anniversary since the revolutionary patriarch\\textbackslash{}'s death June 3, Ahmad Khomeini said his father, known as the Imam, constantly defied ``global arrogance,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' an Iranian phrase for United States and its allies. ``We must always remain on the Imam\\textbackslash{}'s path,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said at a ceremony beginning a 10-day celebration of the Islamic revolution. Ahmad Khomeini said his father warned that, ``if we show the slightest bit of complacency, America will deliver its final blow against us. You, the people, must prepare for struggle against America.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The <b> radio </b> the younger Khomeini, a leading radical, praised his father\\textbackslash{}'s successor as spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for ``treading the same path as the Imam.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' His exhortation for no compromise with the United States was seen as a warning to President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatist faction in Iran. Rafsanjani, who attended the ceremony Khomeini\\textbackslash{}'s golden-domed tomb in the Behesht Zahra cemetery, seeks better relations with the West in order to obtain help in recovering from eight years of war with Iraq. The first part of Rafsanjani\\textbackslash{}'s 5-year development plan, calling for up to \\$20 billion in foreign investment, got Parliament\\textbackslash{}'s approval Wednesday over opposition from radicals who want state control and no foreign involvement. Tehran television showed throngs at the cemetery chanting ``Death to America!\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``Death to Israel!\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Iranian officials paid their respects at the tomb and promised to safeguard Khomeini\\textbackslash{}'s ideological legacy, the <b> radio </b> said. ``At a time when the government was in the hands of the enemy, the Imam\\textbackslash{}'s coming from a safe place to the center of the danger was an act rooted in the immense power of the Lord,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Rafsanjani said at the graveside, the <b> radio </b> reported. Khomeini returned from 14 years of exile Feb. 1, 1979, after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced to flee. Ten days later, the government he left behind collapsed and Khomeini proclaimed the Islamic republic, Rafsanjani said: ``The Iranian people have proved that if a nation is resolute in its stand, and if it has courage and spirit, it cannot be defeated.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said recent changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere were ``a small example of what the people of Iran achieved 11 years ago, and these popular rebellions are the legacy of the people of Iran.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Khamenei, the nation\\textbackslash{}'s spiritual leader, told another gathering in Tehran: ``The future belongs to Islam, the Moslems and the freedom-loving nations of the world,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the television reported. ``In the confrontation with the organizations of the satanic powers (the West), it will be Islam which triumphs.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Despite the fiery rhetoric, this year\\textbackslash{}'s anniversary of the revolution differs from past observances. It reflects the more more relaxed character of Rafsanjani\\textbackslash{}'s government, formed in August, and an easing of Islamic rigidity. While Khomeini was alive, the anniversary was a time of rallies to show support for him, and of reruns on state television of bloody clashes between revolutionary zealots and the shah\\textbackslash{}'s forces. On Thursday, television showed film of Khomeini arriving in Tehran in 1979 on a chartered Air France jet, but comedy and children\\textbackslash{}'s shows dominated the morning programming. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said music would be part of the celebrations this year for the first time. Khomeini felt good Moslems should shun music. </p> 0.329791664560139  \\textbackslash{}n   An Iranian official said both presidential candidates have asked Iran for help securing the <b> release </b> of <b> hostages </b> <b> held </b> in Lebanon. Hussein Sheikholeslam, a deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, spoke at a news conference late Thursday in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, where he stopped en route to Kenya. He said Republican candidate George Bush and Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis made contact with Iran through third parties, including governments and individuals. Bush has denied this, and officials in Washington insist the United States has no direct or indirect contacts with the Iranians. Sheikholeslam said the identity of the intermediaries is ``a touchy question\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and that he did not want to get involved ``in the election games of the United States.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But he said the contacts were not at the level of those conducted in 1986 that led to the Irangate scandal, in which arms were secretly sold to Iran. He did not elaborate. Sheikholeslam stressed that normalizing relations with the United States should be separated from the issue of the <b> hostages </b> <b> held </b> in Lebanon. Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem militants are believed to hold most of the 14 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Nine of the captives are American. The longest <b> held </b> is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was <b> kidnapped </b> March 16, 1985. Sheikholeslam said Iran also was concerned about four Iranians who have been missing in Lebanon for six years. He said that while Iran was appealing for the <b> release </b> of its nationals, it was not necessarily linking their fate to that of the 14 Westerners. Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who lives in exile in Paris, said recently that Richard Lawless, a former U.S. official, negotiated with Iranian government representatives on behalf of Bush for the <b> release </b> of the American hostages. In Washington on Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied again that the U.S. government was negotiating with Iran. Fitzwater took issue with a report Friday in The Nation, a Jerusalem weekly, that <b> talks </b> on the <b> hostages </b> were <b> held </b> but recessed because of news leaks. ``No one is authorized to talk for the (U.S.) government,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``As we have said before, there are all kinds of people around the world freelancing on this situation.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Fitzwater also predicted more such stories, although he did not say why. ``Suffice it to say, we find them (the news reports) mostly detrimental,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``What they do is build up people\\textbackslash{}'s expectations when they are not warranted.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.322289821428602  \\textbackslash{}n   The United States and Iran have signed a \\$105 million settlement of some 3,000 financial claims, bringing the two countries one step closer to re-establishing economic relations, a U.S. official said today. The settlement deals primarily with so-called ``Small Claims\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for under \\$250,000 that stem from the 1979 Islamic revolution, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. It clears the way for the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal to deal with about \\$16 billion in major claims, whose resolution in turn could open the way to normalizing economic ties between the two nations, the official said. The settlement accord was signed late Sunday night or early this morning by Timothy Ramish, U.S. agent to the tribunal, and Iranian Agent Ali Nobari, according to the American official at the tribunal. The most recent settlement <b> talks </b> between U.S. and Iranian officials occurred shortly after the <b> release </b> of American <b> hostages </b> Frank Reed and Robert Polhill by pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon. But U.S. and Iranian representatives to the tribunal have repeatedly stated the <b> talks </b> dealt only with financial arbitration and not with the six remaining Americans still in captivity in Lebanon. Last week a U.S. State Department official in Washington, who commented on condition of anonymity, said he could not predict whether resolving its financial disputes will result in the <b> release </b> of remaining <b> hostages </b> or was in any way related to the <b> release </b> of Polhill and Reed. The Small Claims package dealt primarily with Americans who left behind personal possessions or were owed salaries by Iranian companies when they fled Iran during the revolution. They were settled for a total of \\$50 million. The settlement also provided \\$55 million for repayment of a loan from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The tribunal was set up as part of the Algiers Accord of 1980, which resulted in freedom for the American <b> hostages </b> <b> held </b> by Iranian militants at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The tribunal has three Iranian, three American and three third-nation arbitrators. The biggest claim still before the tribunal, valued at up to \\$11 billion by Iran, is for military equipment which Iran ordered but did not receive as a result of the embargo imposed by the U.S. government. After the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979, Iran canceled contracts for \\$9 billion worth of weaponry, including four destroyers under construction that were later taken over by the U.S. Navy. Remaining major claims, totaling about \\$5 billion, were filed by American oil companies for property and operations expropiated by the Iranian government, as well as for broken contracts. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  investigation keating regulators case lincoln deconcini office loan savings thrift meeting senators frank ethics annunzio federal april contractors cuomo staff </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.537365733743194  \\textbackslash{}n   Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini wrote an aide in 1986 asking what ``we can do to bring heat\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on a <b> federal </b> banking regulator who was opposed by <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> owner Charles H. Keating Jr., the Senate Ethics Committee was told today. The senator\\textbackslash{}'s memo to his <b> staff </b> aide, Laurie A. Sedlmayr, was written in December 1986, after Keating had made clear his opposition to top bank regulator Edwin Gray, who wanted Keating\\textbackslash{}'s <b> thrift </b> to adhere to investment limits. Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett cited the memo in questioning Sedlmayr as the panel held its fifth day of hearings into allegations DeConcini and four other <b> senators </b> improperly intervened with <b> regulators </b> on behalf of Keating, a financial contributor. Sedlmayr said she was aware Keating wanted Gray out of office. DeConcini wrote her a memo on Dec. 11, 1986, citing press accounts of potential financial and ethical problems facing Gray and asking, ``Anything we can do to bring heat?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' She said she responded five days later saying it was ``probably unnecessary\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for him to take action and suggesting the senator ``stay out of this.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sedlmayr, under questioning by Bennett, said Keating was more aggressive than many other businessmen she dealt with. ``I found him to be something of a zealot and I wasn\\textbackslash{}'t comfortable with that,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. ``I think the senator probably thought I was overstating the case,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. Keating, who owned the now defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan, and his associates contributed \\$1.3 million to the senators\\textbackslash{}' campaigns or favored causes. As the panel began its fifth day of hearings in three weeks, DeConcini, D-Ariz., was the only one of the five <b> senators </b> under <b> investigation </b> who attended the session. The other four are Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Donald Riegle of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio. Sedlmayr was questioned about a memo she wrote to DeConcini in 1987 suggesting a possible deal with the government on behalf of Keating\\textbackslash{}'s <b> savings </b> and loan. DeConcini denies he offered a deal or tried to negotiate for Keating in the April 2, 1987, meeting. Sedlmayr testified that DeConcini went to the April 2 <b> meeting </b> with three other <b> senators </b> and Gray despite being warned by an aide that the session was a ``political mistake.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' She testified that she was not concerned about the propriety of the meeting, but was concerned Gray ``would misrepresent it\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' later. ``I told him I didn\\textbackslash{}'t think it was a good idea and could later be misinterpreted by the press,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. ``I thought ... it was a political mistake.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sedlmayr and other aides were not included in the meeting, but she said that when it ended, DeConcini ``said he was pretty disgusted.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' She said DeConcini recounted that Gray had said, ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t know anything about Lincoln, I don\\textbackslash{}'t have any information and you\\textbackslash{}'ll have to meet with the <b> regulators </b> in San Francisco.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, did not attend that meeting. However, he did attend a session on Lincoln a week later with the other <b> senators </b> and San Francisco-based <b> federal </b> regulators. The question of whether DeConcini offered a deal on Keating\\textbackslash{}'s behalf is considered crucial to the <b> ethics </b> investigation. Bennett, told the panel ``there is overwhelming evidence\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' DeConcini asked Gray to withdraw a regulation opposed by Keating in exchange for a promise by Lincoln to make more home loans. The regulation limited Lincoln\\textbackslash{}'s ability to make risky investments in speculative real estate ventures. Sedlmayr\\textbackslash{}'s memo to her boss detailed ``What American Continental wants from Gray for concessions,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``What American Continental is willing to do.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' American Continental was Lincoln\\textbackslash{}'s Phoenix-based parent company, controlled by Keating. A sworn statement by another Senate aide says that DeConcini took the Sedlmayr memo with him to the April 2 <b> meeting </b> and ``made verbal references to the subjects discussed in the memorandum.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' That statement was by Mary Jane Veno, administrative assistant to Glenn. She said she was told of the memo\\textbackslash{}'s use by Gene Karp, DeConcini\\textbackslash{}'s administrative assistant. When the <b> meeting </b> was over, she said, McCain asked DeConcini to explain what he had been talking about and in response DeConcini gave McCain a copy of the memo. But Karp said Friday he did not know if DeConcini actually referred to the memo and could not recall what he told Veno. ``As I remember it now, Gray said at the very beginning he didn\\textbackslash{}'t know anything about Lincoln and DeConcini never got into the subject matter of the <b> investigation </b> or anything about that,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Karp said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Whether there was any specific reference made, I can\\textbackslash{}'t answer. Only the principals that were there can answer it.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gray has said DeConcini offered a ``quid pro quo\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' proposal and that Gray believed the <b> meeting </b> was improper. No aides attended the April 2 meeting, and Bennett said there is evidence DeConcini\\textbackslash{}'s <b> office </b> instructed all to come alone. Lincoln was the object of a bank board examination at the time of the meeting. Bennett said the <b> senators </b> were there ``with varying degrees of intensity, to pressure the board to end promptly the Lincoln examination.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lincoln was seized by the <b> federal </b> government in April 1989 at a potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than \\$2 billion to cover insured deposits. </p> 0.526604334871864  \\textbackslash{}n   A U.S. <b> thrift </b> regulator testified Friday that Sen. Dennis DeConcini broke the bounds of propriety - but four other <b> senators </b> did not - when they intervened on behalf of <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> owner Charles H. Keating Jr. Regulator Michael Patriarca, addressing the Senate Ethics Committee, drew the line between the behavior of DeConcini, D-Ariz. and four colleagues: John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif. Patriarca said it was wrong for a senator to attempt to ``influence, to change the outcome\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of an examination that was highly critical of Keating\\textbackslash{}'s Lincoln Savings and Loan. ``My personal view is Senator DeConcini did that,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s not clear to me that any of the others did.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The regulator was referring to the senators\\textbackslash{}' conduct at an April 9, 1987 <b> meeting </b> with four San Francisco-based <b> regulators </b> - including Patriarca - who were responsible for the Lincoln investigation. Patriarca also said he would fault the <b> senators </b> generally, because they ``appeared to have made up their minds in advance\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that Keating was right and the <b> regulators </b> were wrong in finding serious problems at Lincoln. Patriarca\\textbackslash{}'s two days of testimony backed the assertion of his ex-boss, former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray, that DeConcini took the lead in trying to negotiate a deal on Keating\\textbackslash{}'s behalf. DeConcini denied that he sought a waiver for Lincoln of a rule prohibiting risky investments, in return for the <b> thrift </b> establishing a home mortgage <b> loan </b> program. Patriarca was questioned by Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., one of six Ethics Committee members who will judge whether the five <b> senators </b> improperly intervened for Keating. Keating and associates donated \\$1.3 million to the campaigns and political causes of the five senators. The committee has held nine days of hearings in an effort to determine whether the money influenced the intervention. The hearing adjourned until Monday after a former member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board testified he received calls from Cranston and DeConcini in April 1989 - immediately before the government takeover of Lincoln. In those calls, said Roger Martin, both <b> senators </b> urged the board to approve a sale of Lincoln rather than its seizure. The requests were rejected. All the <b> senators </b> except Riegle met on Keating\\textbackslash{}'s behalf with Gray on April 2, 1987 in DeConcini\\textbackslash{}'s office. When the chief regulator said he lacked details of the Lincoln investigation, the four San Francisco-based <b> regulators </b> including Patriarca, were summoned to the April 9 meeting. That also was in DeConcini\\textbackslash{}'s <b> office </b> and this time Riegle joined the group. Rudman asked Patriarca whether he thought DeConcini was ``out of line\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in the April 9 meeting, when he sought the waiver for Lincoln. ``Yes I did, senator,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the regulator responded. He said that the proper way to challenge the regulation was through the courts and Lincoln ``had a retainer with every significant law firm in the country\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to do so. Lincoln in fact did, shortly before the meetings with regulators, file a court suit challenging the rule. The suit was not successful. Patriarca said McCain showed the ``least prejudice\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' toward <b> regulators </b> at the April 9 meeting; DeConcini and ``perhaps Sen. Glenn seemed to have their minds made up pretty substantially\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and Riegle was ``in the middle.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Another member of the committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., asked if the <b> senators </b> were hostile at the meeting. ``I think it was hostile,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Patriarca said. ``We were being dressed down.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Helms then asked whether the <b> senators </b> expressed ``surprise or shock\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' after the <b> regulators </b> informed them that serious problems - and possible criminality - were found at Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif. ``We didn\\textbackslash{}'t seem to be getting through to the senators,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the regulator said. ``They did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that we were trying to convey to them.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' On Thursday, Patriarca said the <b> senators </b> became less aggressive when <b> regulators </b> said they would make criminal referrals to the Justice Department. </p> 0.430818882237569  \\textbackslash{}n   The Senate Ethics Committee today opened politically-charged hearings into links between five <b> senators </b> and the owner of a failed <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> and the panel\\textbackslash{}'s chairman bluntly told the lawmakers that many people believe ``you sold your office.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Four of the so-called Keating Five looked on as Sen. Howell Heflin said, ``many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services were bought by Charles Keating, that you were bribed, that you sold your office, that you traded your honor and your good names for contributions and other benefits.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sens. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona each listened intently as Heflin spoke in his gravely Southern accent. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment, did not attend. All five deny any wrongdoing. Committee counsel Robert Bennett jostled a boxed puzzle before the committee members as he began his opening statement, saying he would provide them with a picture that later pieces of evidence would fill in. Bennett said Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle ``were important players\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in helping Keating in his ``all-out war\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' with <b> federal </b> regulators. He said McCain and Glenn played lesser roles. Bennett said he did not contend it was improper for the <b> senators </b> to hold meetings with <b> federal </b> regulators, but that it was up to the panel to decide whether their actions were improper. He said ``there can be no doubt\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that the intent of each of the five <b> senators </b> was to help Keating when they met with <b> federal </b> <b> regulators </b> in 1987. The five <b> senators </b> received a total of \\$1.3 million in campaign contributions or donations to their favored causes from Keating and his associates. All contacted <b> federal </b> <b> regulators </b> on behalf of Keating at a time when the government was considering whether to seize the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine, Calif.-based <b> thrift </b> institution. The <b> thrift </b> later collapsed at an estimated cost to the taxpayers of \\$2 billion. Heflin told the five they would have the chance to say whether the donations ``influenced your actions in any way.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said lawmakers\\textbackslash{}' activities legitimately include helping their constituents and overseeing government institutions and added that there is room for disagreement about conclusions in the case. Bennett said the evidence will be clear despite the refusal of Keating to answer questions during the Senate inquiry. Keating has been indicted in California on state securities fraud charges and is awaiting trial. ``One could ask the question, `If Mr. Keating were here, would you believe what he had to say anyway?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Bennett said. The five <b> senators </b> have become a symbol of the massive <b> savings </b> industry collapse, and the outcome of the <b> ethics </b> hearings could intensify the political ramifications of what so far has been a bipartisan scandal. In addition, the <b> case </b> has highlighted a political system that gives lawmakers great latitude in contacting <b> federal </b> <b> regulators </b> on behalf of constituents, at the same time they are dependent on campaign contributions to mount their political campaigns. The hearings stemmed from a complaint last year by the citizens group Common Cause. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s not just the five <b> senators </b> but the whole Senate whose integrity and credibility is on the line,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Fred Werthheimer, the organization\\textbackslash{}'s leader. Heflin and others on the panel said the <b> case </b> should not create a standard that bars members of Congress from intervening with <b> federal </b> agencies on behalf of constituents or campaign contributors. ``A standard of conduct which would preclude members of Congress from intervening on behalf of individuals who happened to have contributed to or raised funds for their campaign is nonsensical and unworkable under existing law,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., another member of the committee, complained that panel has taken too long with the case. ``We should have already taken certain ... actions,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Heflin, D-Ala., defended the panel\\textbackslash{}'s decision to hold the hearings against charges of partisanship. ``On all the votes taken by the committee ... not one was divided along partisan lines,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. With documents stacked several inches high on a table covered with green felt, Heflin framed the issue that the <b> ethics </b> panel will have to grapple with: ``The allegation in this case, that an individual used his wealth to get preferential treatment from government officials in the performance of their official duties, raises questions which are as old as history, and issues that bear on the balance of power among the branches of the <b> federal </b> government. The committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or recommend a more serious punishment to the full Senate. Each senator has denied any connection between Keating\\textbackslash{}'s money and their meetings with regulators. The basic issue is whether any violated Senate rules against exerting improper influence in return for compensation. All except Riegle attended an April 2, 1987, <b> meeting </b> with Ed Gray, then the top <b> thrift </b> regulator. All five attended another <b> meeting </b> a week later with San Francisco-based bank examiners who revealed that potential criminal actions by Lincoln were involved. McCain\\textbackslash{}'s top aide, Chris Koch, said McCain would make the <b> case </b> that he ended his friendship with Keating on March 24, 1987, when Keating asked the senator to negotiate with <b> regulators </b> on his behalf. ``There\\textbackslash{}'s no smoking gun on Don Riegle,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the Michigan senator\\textbackslash{}'s lawyer, Thomas Green, said before the hearing. He contended that Riegle\\textbackslash{}'s <b> meeting </b> with <b> regulators </b> was unrelated to a fund-raising effort Keating directed for Riegle. DeConcini wrote a letter to about 5,000 supporters this week denying wrongdoing. ``You may hear derogatory statements about me and my office, but I can assure you that I have not betrayed my public trust, nor do I intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their dealings with our government,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' DeConcini said. Glenn has said in the past that he had no discussions on behalf of Lincoln after the 1987 <b> meeting </b> when <b> regulators </b> said criminal charges were possible. Cranston\\textbackslash{}'s spokesman, Murray Flander, said Cranston contends, ``I pocketed no money, I broke no law, I violated no Senate rule. Those are undisputed facts.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.352777354026735  \\textbackslash{}n   Gov. Mario Cuomo today accused lawyers for a black teen-ager who says she was assaulted by six white men of ``making up conditions\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' as part of their continuing refusal to have the young woman testify about the case. Meanwhile, the teen-ager\\textbackslash{}'s aunt was quoted today as saying the girl hadn\\textbackslash{}'t even talked about the <b> case </b> with the lawyers representing her. Tawana Brawley, 16, missing for four days in November, was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces, with racial insults scrawled on her body. She said she was assaulted by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge. Miss Brawley, of Wappinger\\textbackslash{}'s Falls north of New York City, and her family have refused to be questioned further on the advice of attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. of New York City, the lawyers who used a similar tactic to get a special prosecutor appointed in the Howard Beach manslaughter case. Cuomo had nothing good to say about those lawyers at an impromptu news conference today. ``They said they had reasons they could not cooperate. ... It\\textbackslash{}'s clear now they don\\textbackslash{}'t really,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Cuomo said of the two lawyers. ``These conditions obviously don\\textbackslash{}'t mean anything. They keep making up new conditions.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Maddox and Mason were on the road this morning and not immediately available for comment on Cuomo\\textbackslash{}'s statements or today\\textbackslash{}'s report in the Middletown Times Herald Record newspaper that Miss Brawley hadn\\textbackslash{}'t talked to the lawyers about the case. Cuomo said again today that he was willing to meet with Miss Brawley if it would help push the stalled <b> investigation </b> along. However, he said he would do so only if her lawyers approved and state Attorney General Robert Abrams, Cuomo\\textbackslash{}'s special prosecutor in the case, said it would be helpful. In her interview with the Middletown newspaper, Juanita Brawley, who helped raise Tawana for eight years and who has spent time with her since her attack, said she is the only one who knows enough about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girl\\textbackslash{}'s mother informed. ``I know a few things that no one else knows,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said in an interview at her home. She said of Maddox: ``He has not talked to Tawana. He does not need to talk to Tawana.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' She did not elaborate. On Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said the Brawley family would go to jail before testifying before a grand jury empaneled by Abrams. Sharpton, a minister from New York City who has said he is advising the family, said Cuomo is using ``macho politics\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in trying to compel Tawana\\textbackslash{}'s testimony. On Wednesday, Cuomo had called on Abrams to ask a grand jury when it convenes Monday in Poughkeepsie to force Miss Brawley and her family to cooperate with investigators. ``Someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a young girl who has already been abused,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sharpton said of Cuomo. This morning, Cuomo said that whatever happened with the grand jury, he thought it was ``very unlikely\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that Tawana would be sent to jail even if she continued her refusal to cooperate with Abrams\\textbackslash{}' investigation. On Thursday, Cuomo had told New York City radio station WLIB that he can\\textbackslash{}'t understand why the Brawley family will not cooperate with authorities. ``I see no reason, no common-sense reason, no difficult-to-understand reason, why there is not cooperation,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Cuomo said. ``At one point you have to ask yourself, why aren\\textbackslash{}'t they cooperating with the prosecutors?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.350349098513716  \\textbackslash{}n   Highflying former <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> owner Donald Ray Dixon goes on trial Wednesday on charges he used depositors\\textbackslash{}' money to finance lavish acquisitions, leaving taxpayers with a \\$1.3 billion <b> federal </b> bailout. Dixon, 50, traveled the world for gourmet parties and acquired such trinkets as a 17th Century castle door, Baccarat crystal, Remington sculptures, a silver-studded saddle and a posh house in Solana Beach, Calif., just north of San Diego. The government says those luxuries, as well as payments to prostitutes and political campaigns, were financed from the vaults at Vernon Savings \\& Loan Association, which collapsed under the weight of Dixon\\textbackslash{}'s excess in 1987 and was taken over by the government. A dozen other Vernon executives and associates have preceded Dixon in court; 10 have been convicted and a guilty verdict against two others was set aside because the jury discussed Dixon\\textbackslash{}'s indictment. ``Perhaps when my day in court comes, if they\\textbackslash{}'ll listen, they\\textbackslash{}'ll find out what really happened and the blame can be properly assessed and properly assigned,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dixon said in July when he was arraigned on a 38-count indictment. The indictment charged him with conspiracy, misapplication of funds, making false statements and other crimes. Jury selection was to begin Wednesday in <b> federal </b> court. Testimony is expected to begin Monday, and continue three to four weeks. If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be sentenced to up to 190 years in prison and fined as much as \\$9.5 million. An extra-large panel of 75 to 80 potential jurors was called because of publicity in the case, said Jean Hiller, court coordinator for U.S. District Judge Joe A. Fish. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jarvis of Dallas said 40 to 50 prosecution witnesses could testify. Included on that list is a convicted madam, who has confirmed that she supplied prostitutes for Vernon executives when they were in San Diego. Defense and prosecution attorneys declined to discuss the <b> case </b> this week, citing a instructions from Fish. Until the recent notoriety given Neal Bush and Silverado Savings and Loan in Colorado or Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loan in California, Dixon and Vernon were at or near the top of the list of abuses cited in the industry. Dixon\\textbackslash{}'s trial is an effort ``to bring to justice people who break the law, who use <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> associations as personal piggy banks, and who may have thought they could just walk away free and let the American taxpayer shoulder the cost of their greed,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Timothy Ryan, Office of Thrift Supervision director in Washington. Vernon had a luxury yacht and a fleet of five planes worth \\$6 million. The S\\&L also paid the \\$22,000 tab for Dixon\\textbackslash{}'s gastronomic tour of European restaurants, the government said. Dixon also is charged with illegal contributions to such politicians as former House Speaker Jim Wright and Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York who is now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Recipients of those funds did not know they came from illegal sources, prosecutors have said. When <b> regulators </b> closed Vernon, it was the largest <b> thrift </b> bailout in history, and it remains among the most expensive. Most of the expensive acquisitions have been sold at auction since the government takeover. When <b> regulators </b> closed Vernon, they renamed it Monfort Savings Association. In December 1988, Monfort was one of five insolvent thrifts combined to create First Gibraltar Bank, the largest <b> savings </b> and <b> loan </b> in Texas. Vernon also has resulted in the stiffest sentence to date for an S\\&L officer. Former Chairman Woody F. Lemons was sentenced to 30 years in prison earlier this year. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  government party political opposition minister power leader elections country communist democratic national leaders parties movement groups council prime parliament constitution </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.477649757052216  \\textbackslash{}n   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, head of Sweden\\textbackslash{}'s caretaker Cabinet, is ready to lead a new <b> government </b> to replace the one which resigned last week, the <b> national </b> news agency TT reported Thursday. Earlier Thursday, the Social Democratic <b> leader </b> informed Parliament Speaker Thage G. Peterson he was ready and able to present the <b> government </b> to the legislature for approval. He was expected to get active support from the small Communist Party and passive support for the comeback by the middle-of-the-road Center Party.

Unrelenting pressure from the <b> opposition </b> in Parliament and from strikes and street demonstrations forced Premier Andrei Lukanov and his <b> government </b> of former Communists to leave office on Thursday. Tens of thousands of people cheered in the streets of Sofia, an <b> opposition </b> stronghold. But Lukanov\\textbackslash{}'s demise may prove a Pyrrhic victory. The main <b> opposition </b> group, the Union of Democratic Forces, must now prove it can help solve Bulgaria\\textbackslash{}'s social and economic woes. ``Not even Jesus can fill Bulgarian stores,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lukanov said in a recent speech. A new coalition <b> government </b> probably will be announced next week. So far, nothing has been revealed about who will head it, whether it will be a collection of nonpolitical experts or draw in equal numbers on <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> and the still-powerful Socialists. The Union of Democratic Forces <b> opposition </b> had long criticized Lukanov for mismanagement, demanding that he step down. But it is questionable whether anybody could manage Bulgaria\\textbackslash{}'s economy, which is so dependent on the collapsing Soviet bloc that it can only reflect the chaos of that disintegrating alliance. The <b> opposition </b> case against Lukanov always seemed to rest more on a desire to get the former Communists out of office. The opposition, and many of its Western supporters, seemed convinced it would win June elections. When the Socialists won, the <b> opposition </b> formally accepted the result, but has seemed unable to live with it since. Street demonstrations got under way almost immediately, with students around the <b> country </b> occupying universities to force the resignation of Socialist President Petar Mladenov. Mladenov bowed to the pressure in early July. Then it took three weeks of Byzantine <b> political </b> wrangling to get Zhelyu Zhelev, formerly the <b> opposition </b> leader, appointed president. Lukanov, seen by observers as one of the few capable politicians in Bulgaria, was widely credited with persuading the Socialists to accept Zhelev. But the <b> opposition </b> never came through with the tacitly implied second part of the deal: agreement to join the former Communists in Lukanov\\textbackslash{}'s government. Backed by some Western diplomats, the <b> opposition </b> apparently felt the Socialists were a spent <b> political </b> force bound to disintegrate. For his part, Lukanov refused to break with the Socialist Party, arguing that it stood for his social <b> democratic </b> ideals. Lukanov eventually appointed an all-Socialist <b> government </b> but continued to battle for broad support, arguing this was vital to a vague but sweeping program of economic reform. Meanwhile, the economy and society slid into chaos. Electricity and food rationing began in Sofia and other cities in September. Stores have grown barer since. Power is now shut off two hours in every four in the capital. The worst outburst of violence came in late August, when an angry crowd invaded Socialist Party headquarters, burning and pillaging several offices. Last week, the <b> opposition </b> took the decisive step of walking out of Parliament. A general strike by the main <b> opposition </b> union this week proved the final blow to the Socialist government. Although the <b> political </b> <b> parties </b> are said to have agreed on a transition <b> government </b> until new <b> elections </b> are held in May, there is virtually no evidence of <b> political </b> unity. The Socialist Party draws on 100 years of tradition and is even older than the Soviet Communist movement, but remains severely split. The unwieldy <b> opposition </b> coalition of 16 <b> parties </b> also is deeply divided, and boasts few figures of Lukanov\\textbackslash{}'s caliber. On Friday, Sofia returned to its bitter reality. The shoppers glumly queuing for food know the new <b> government </b> is unlikely to make life much better. ``Even though I am stepping down, my economic and social program has no alternative,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Lukanov told the Grand National Assembly in his farewell speech Friday. In his last weeks before resigning, Lukanov pushed for radical market-oriented reforms including an austerity budget that would jack up many state-controlled prices, close down unprofitable firms and introduce guarantees for foreign investments. If Bulgaria does not carry out radical reforms soon, it could find itself lagging far behind ``the European train\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of change, Lukanov told reporters. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m afraid we have already missed the train,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he added. --- EDITORS: Veselin Toshkov, AP correspondent in Sofia, has worked in posts in Bulgaria and abroad for 15 years. </p> 0.431498096259634  \\textbackslash{}n   Opposition <b> leaders </b> and Communist officials have tentatively set <b> national </b> <b> elections </b> for June, <b> government </b> television reported. ``According to unofficial information, the first round of (parliamentary) <b> elections </b> should take place on June 8,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Czechoslovak TV said Thursday. The report came as the Communists, other <b> political </b> <b> parties </b> and the <b> opposition </b> Civic Forum met to review procedures for the <b> elections </b> and the status of independent <b> political </b> parties. ``The draft <b> elections </b> law is aimed at having the <b> elections </b> for the Federal Assembly and both National Councils (parliament) first ... and in the second half of the year the <b> elections </b> to the lower levels of representative bodies should take place,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the television said. The 35O-member Czechoslovak Parliament is so far dominated by Communists. The discussions are expected to produce a solution to balancing its membership to reflect the current <b> political </b> situation. The talks are being attended by all five <b> political </b> <b> parties </b> existing before the revolution and the loosely organized <b> opposition </b> group, Civic Forum. About 20 new <b> political </b> <b> parties </b> have been created in Czechoslovakia the past two months, but none is represented at the current talks. The peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia led to the ouster of Communist <b> party </b> chief Milos Jakes and his hard-line colleagues in late November.

The move by the governing Democratic Justice Party, coupled with strenuous efforts by the two centrist <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> to merge, made the country\\textbackslash{}'s <b> political </b> picture complex. ``We will actively respond to moves by the two <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> to merge,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said the governing party\\textbackslash{}'s secretary general, Park Jun-byung. Another Democratic Justice official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``It is possible that we would consider forming a new pan-national, centrist <b> party </b> representing all <b> democratic </b> groups.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' If the new conservative <b> party </b> is formed, the governing <b> party </b> could be folded and its leader, Roh, would give up <b> party </b> membership and stay neutral, the same official said. Kim Young-sam, head of the No. 2 <b> opposition </b> group, said today that he would firm up plans next month to merge his Reunification Democratic Party with the No. 3 <b> opposition </b> group, the New Democratic Republican Party, led by former premier Kim Jong-pil. The two <b> opposition </b> <b> leaders </b> earlier agreed in principle to merge their <b> parties </b> possibly before local elections, scheduled in the first half of this year. ``It would not be a simple merger of two parties. The new <b> party </b> to be born would be a central force comprising all conservative groups,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Kim Young-sam told reporters. Kim said his ultimate goal is to make the present four-party system into a bipartisan setup. If the two <b> parties </b> merge, it would become the largest <b> opposition </b> group, replacing Kim Dae-jung\\textbackslash{}'s Party for Peace and Democracy. The emergence of a centrist <b> opposition </b> <b> party </b> would be welcome news for the governing party, which has been trying to isolate and discredit Kim Dae-jung\\textbackslash{}'s liberal, pro-reform party. Kim Dae-jung, holding a news conference today, vehemently opposed the planned merger by his <b> opposition </b> rivals, contending an artificial restructuring of the present four-party system would only benefit Roh\\textbackslash{}'s governing party. He said the <b> government </b> camp would try to use the planned <b> opposition </b> merger to seek a conservative alliance, through which it would try to remain in <b> power </b> beyond 1993, when Roh steps down at the end of a single five-year term. Many politicians believe the <b> government </b> camp also favors a <b> political </b> realignment that would enable it to hold onto <b> power </b> as Japan\\textbackslash{}'s governing Liberal Democratic Party does. If its plan to merge or seek alliance with <b> opposition </b> moderates is successful, the <b> government </b> camp, assured of enough votes in the Assembly, would propose a constitutional amendemnt to change the present presidential system into a Cabinet setup headed by a <b> prime </b> minister, they said. The governing party, with 127 seats in the Assembly, is currently far short of a two-third majority required for a constitutional amendment. South Korea\\textbackslash{}'s politics are currently controlled by four main parties, neither of which has a controling majority in the 299-member National Assembly. The three main <b> opposition </b> <b> parties </b> have a combined majority in the single house but intense rivalry makes it difficult for them to cooperate. At his news conference, Kim Dae-jung said he would try to rally support from ``centrist <b> democratic </b> forces\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to counter moves by his rivals to merge or seek alliance. However, his proposal lacked details. He also reiterated that his <b> party </b> would, if the <b> government </b> endorses the plan, send delegates to <b> communist </b> North Korea in the first half of this year to discuss <b> national </b> unification. If the dispatch of the <b> party </b> delegation is proven successful, Kim said he would visit Pyongyang with <b> government </b> approval to meet with North Korean <b> leader </b> Kim Il Sung He said President Roh responded favorably when he raised the issue last week. But presidential and <b> government </b> officials said the <b> opposition </b> plan to send delegates to the north was premature. </p> 0.395253676640631  \\textbackslash{}n   Neil Kinnock, <b> leader </b> of Britain\\textbackslash{}'s <b> opposition </b> Labor Party, will be challenged for the post by veteran leftist Tony Benn at the <b> party </b> conference in the fall, a Labor coalition said Wednesday.

The announcement came after a meeting of the party\\textbackslash{}'s <b> national </b> executive committee. Kinnock, 46, and Hattersley are considered not as left wing as Benn and Heffer.

The center, planned for some time, opened Thursday. Choy said he expects students to welcome the courses, noting the ethnically diverse student body has a strong interest in race and <b> minority </b> reations. Some students boycotted classes for two days last month to protest the lack of ethnic diversity among the faculty. Out of 1,636 full professors, only 24 percent are <b> women </b> or members of <b> minority </b> groups. ``Frankly, this center was created partly to help get the faculty up to date,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Choy said. ``We have to teach them, too.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The 1989-90 student body is 45 percent white, 27 percent Asian, 13 percent Hispanic, 8 percent black, 1 percent American Indian and 6 percent undeclared, according to the school. The cultural studies center was created as part of a restructuring of Berkeley\\textbackslash{}'s 1960s-era ethnic studies programs, Choy said. ``Most ethnics studies classes just talk about one group,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``We want to create new classes that will deal with at least three <b> minority </b> <b> groups </b> at one time in an integrated, comparative way.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Such an overlapping picture of ethnic <b> groups </b> will better mirror society, he said. </p> 0.333286187168428  \\textbackslash{}n   A federal judge apologized Thursday to an attorney he had scolded and threatened with jail when she insisted on using her maiden name and the courtesy title ``Ms.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in court. ``I have always referred to married <b> women </b> by their married name. This is the way my generation was taught,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Senior U.S. District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum, 73. ``I recognize your right to be addressed in any manner in which you see fit, and I apologize for my comments and the resulting situation,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the judge told Barbara Wolvovitz and three other attorneys involved in the trial of a race <b> discrimination </b> suit against PPG Industries Inc. On July 8, Teitelbaum told Ms. Wolvovitz, whose husband is University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel: ``From here on, in this courtroom you will use Mrs. Lobel. That\\textbackslash{}'s your name.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The judge originally threatened her with jail when she resisted his instruction, and when her co-counsel, Jon Pushinsky, protested, Teitelbaum found him in contempt for ``officious intermeddling\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and gave him a suspended 30-day jail sentence. Ms. Wolvovitz, representing two black <b> men </b> suing PPG, moved Monday for a mistrial, which Teitelbaum rejected. When she again stated her preference, he said: ``What if I call you sweetie?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The judge said he would settle for calling her ``counselor.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He also vacated his contempt order for Pushinsky. The jury began deliberations Wednesday afternoon and was still out when the judge made his apology, which was officially entered into court records. Teitelbaum said that if Ms. Wolvovitz still wanted to press for a mistrial, he would grant it before the jury returned with a verdict. Teitelbaum said the parties would be ``stuck with that verdict\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' if they declined his offer. The attorneys agreed to not seek a mistrial. Hours later, the jury decided against Ms. Wolvovitz\\textbackslash{}'s clients, who had charged they were harassed at work because of their race. Ms. Wolvovitz, 36, who has practiced law for 10 years, and Pushinsky did not want to comment further after the judge\\textbackslash{}'s apology, Pushinsky said Thursday. ``I think that he did what he had to do, and thank God he did it,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said National Organization for Women President Molly Yard, a Pittsburgh resident who is familiar with Teitelbaum. ``I think it\\textbackslash{}'s raised everybody\\textbackslash{}'s consciousness and that\\textbackslash{}'s fine.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Tom Hollander, president of the Allegheny County Bar Association, said: ``I think it was big of him to apologize.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' JoAnn Dempler, Teitelbaum\\textbackslash{}'s law clerk for eight years, said the judge ``is not sexist ... does not discriminate against woman ... does not demean women.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``He\\textbackslash{}'s a tease,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said Thursday. ``His sense of humor is such that he likes to tease and joke and kid around, and if people do not know that, they could easily misconstrue what he\\textbackslash{}'s doing or saying. ``Even in court, because we\\textbackslash{}'re dealing with very serious matters, every once in a while to just sort of inject a little levity or reduce tension he will make a lighthearted remark, and people who know him realize he doesn\\textbackslash{}'t mean to offend anyone,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mrs. Dempler said. Teitelbaum said he wasn\\textbackslash{}'t teasing when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she would ``sleep in the county jail tonight\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' if she refused to be addressed as Mrs. Lobel. ``I unfortunately lost my temper and the matter then got out of hand,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. The judge also said he misstated Pennsylvania law when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she was legally required to use her husband\\textbackslash{}'s last name unless she had court permission to do otherwise. ``I was wrong,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Teitelbaum said. ``I made a mistake.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.332884933072444  \\textbackslash{}n   In South Africa, feminism is viewed with suspicion as a foreign philosophy, even among many women.

The accolade and note of caution came Tuesday as the commission released a report entitled ``Ten Years in Prime Time: An Analysis of the Image of Women on Entertainment Television, 1979-1988,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' which examined the portrayal of <b> women </b> and compared the fictional panorama with the profile of real-life <b> women </b> during the decade. ``The 1980s mark a decade of progress for <b> women </b> on television. Their portrayals have become more diverse and, for the most part, more true-to-life,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the report said. ``... The networks get a pat on the back,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said the study\\textbackslash{}'s author, Sally Streenland. The study said 60 percent of <b> female </b> characters on the 25 top Nielsen rated shows in 1979 were portrayed as employed outside the home. By 1987, that figure had risen to 75 percent. By comparison, 1987 <b> population </b> statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau show that 56 percent of all <b> women </b> were in the labor force. Streenland\\textbackslash{}'s study also showed TV painting an unrealistically rosy picture of the types of jobs held by women. In 1979, more than 40 percent of television\\textbackslash{}'s <b> women </b> were employed in clerical or service jobs. By 1987 only 23 percent of the <b> women </b> on TV had the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional careers. The real life situation is that 47 percent of working <b> women </b> have clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent work in professional or managerial jobs. The report also showed that black <b> women </b> have become more visible on TV. In 1979 there was only one black <b> female </b> character on television, but by 1987, 22 percent of <b> women </b> characters were black. </p> 0.312385004656423  \\textbackslash{}n   Authorities are extending mandatory birth control to the far northwest\\textbackslash{}'s ethnic minorities, but they will be allowed more children than majority Hans, an official report said Sunday.

Minority ethnic <b> groups </b> in Xinjiang total 8.6 million, or more than 61 percent of the population, the report said. Most Hans or ethnic Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of China\\textbackslash{}'s 1 billion people, are limited to one child with the country struggling to feed and educate its spiraling population. However, the policy has been more relaxed toward China\\textbackslash{}'s 56 ethnic <b> minority </b> groups. The different standard toward minorities has been designed in part to win their loyalty to the Han-controlled government and allay their fears of being overwhelmed by ethnic Chinese. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  magazine newspaper paper newspapers editor publisher press news publication article note publishing hotel published women reporter advertising media editorial journal </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.683699096281642  \\textbackslash{}n   The following are the most popular videocassettes as they appear in next week\\textbackslash{}'s issue of Billboard magazine.

Photographer David Mecey had planned to meet with Providence College students for part of a Big East athletic conference layout scheduled for the April 1989 issue, Playboy spokeswoman Cindy Rakowitz said from New York. Mecey, who planned to stay in Providence from Wednesday through Friday, intended to interview and photograph <b> women </b> in various locations, including the Providence Marriott Inn where he had a reservation. The planned feature would include nude and semi-nude photos. The hotel\\textbackslash{}'s name and number were listed on a Playboy leaflet and in a quarter-page advertisement to appear in today\\textbackslash{}'s edition of The NewPaper, said Anne Trumbore, an employee at the weekly alternative newspaper. But Stephen McCarthy, the hotel\\textbackslash{}'s resident manager, said that when officials realized Wednesday morning who Mecey was, they decided not to allow him to conduct business at the hotel. Mecey was told by <b> hotel </b> officials when he arrived Wednesday night that he could not conduct interviews on <b> hotel </b> property. ``If he wants to stay here, he can. He has rented a room and we are in the business of renting rooms,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said general manager Rene Neidhart. ``But he did not have our authorization to use our name in any advertisements, and he cannot interview or photograph in the hotel.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``I\\textbackslash{}'m not entirely taken aback, but I think that\\textbackslash{}'s pretty drastic,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Rakowitz when informed of the Marriott\\textbackslash{}'s decision. ``That\\textbackslash{}'s sort of eliminating the rights of the individual to make a freedom of choice \\_ but a <b> hotel </b> is private property.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Playboy also was banned from interviewing or staying at the Sheraton Tara in Braintree, Mass., when it interviews Boston College students in mid-November, said Jeff Cohen, Playboy\\textbackslash{}'s managing photo editor. Some people who arrived at the Marriott looking for Mecey were escorted off <b> hotel </b> property by security guards, said McCarthy. He said several people, both <b> women </b> and men, were removed from the lobby and floors. Playboy had decided against seeking the cooperation of administrators at any of the schools it will visit, deciding instead to advertise off-campus and in college newspapers. Playboy had hoped to run an ad in the Cowl, the student <b> newspaper </b> at the 3,800-student college, but students and administrators decided against it, said a school spokesman, the Rev. John McGreevy. Officials at St. John\\textbackslash{}'s University in New York, another Catholic school, decided earlier this month against running an <b> article </b> about the Playboy feature in its student newspaper. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m still confident that we will recruit our women,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Rakowitz, who said about 20 <b> women </b> were wanted for the feature. ``I\\textbackslash{}'ve never come into a problem at a hotel.

Also Monday, at least three <b> people </b> were <b> killed </b> and six injured in confrontations between security forces and Moslem protesters agitating for the secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-majority India. State Gov. Jagmohan said the Jammu-Kashmir assembly was being dissolved because it had ``lost its representative character.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The move clears the way for new elections to the assembly, which could form the basis for making peace overtures to the militants. Many of the <b> militants </b> say they were members of political parties earlier, and began agitating for an independent nation after what they claim was widespread rigging during the 1987 elections. ``It has been alleged that in 1987 some vested interests had rigged the election,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Jagmohan said in a statement issued in Srinagar. In those elections, Farooq Abdullah was voted the chief minister, the top elected post in the <b> state </b> administration, for a five-year term. Abdullah resigned from the post on Jan. 19 to protest the appointment of Jagmohan as governor of the state. Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, has said that quelling militant violence and holding new elections is the only way to defuse the separatist movement in the Moslem-majority state. Police reported at least three deaths Monday as Moslem crowds violated curfew orders in two towns in the valley. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two <b> people </b> were <b> killed </b> and six injured when police opened fire to control a rioting mob in the town of Bijbehara, 30 <b> miles </b> southeast of Srinagar. One person was <b> killed </b> in the town of Shopian, 33 <b> miles </b> south of Srinagar, in another incident of police firing, they said. The deaths raise to at least 103 the number of <b> people </b> <b> killed </b> since authorities launched a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20. Most of the victims have been protesters <b> killed </b> in police firing on curfew violators. The movement for secession of Kashmir from India is at least four decades old, but has flared in recent months. The <b> state </b> of Jammu-Kashmir, which includes the valley and the plains of Jammu to the south, is India\\textbackslash{}'s only Moslem-majority state. India and Pakistan have both claimed Kashmir since the Indian subcontinent was divided along religious lines after gaining independence from Britain in 1947. The countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, and Pakistan occupies a slice of the valley. A U.N.-monitored cease-fire line divides the valley into Indian and Pakistani sectors. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the trouble in Kashmir. Islamabad denies the charge but says the Kashmri <b> people </b> have a right to self-determination. About 64 <b> percent </b> of Jammu-Kashmir\\textbackslash{}'s 6 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 <b> percent </b> of the 880 <b> million </b> population. Hindus make up 82 percent. </p> 0.562268472012152  \\textbackslash{}n   Three Sinhalese <b> extremists </b> and a soldier were <b> killed </b> and <b> militants </b> torched buses on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence, police said today. Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in Colombo, the capital, and its surburbs. Police said <b> people </b> were afraid to open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed to the Indian-brokered peace accord. A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the island\\textbackslash{}'s south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike. Residents in the northern city of Vavuniya, about 125 <b> miles </b> northeast of Colombo, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also declared curfews in some areas in the island\\textbackslash{}'s north and east until Sunday morning to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels. The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for five years for independence in the north and east of the island and by the Peoples Liberation Front, an extremist group from the island\\textbackslash{}'s majority Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority, while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for independence. Three men were <b> killed </b> by police in separate incidents in which Sinhalese <b> extremists </b> tried to attack <b> government </b> property, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said a Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with <b> extremists </b> in Hambantota district in the south. In southern and central Sri Lanka, strongholds of the Sinhalese extremists, at least eight government-owned buses were set afire Thursday night and this morning, the police spokesman said. Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern Sri Lanka were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese <b> extremists </b> bew up electrical transformers, he said. A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a firebomb as it pulled into Colombo, police said. Only a few government-owned or private buses were seen running. In the island\\textbackslash{}'s north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called for a demonstration to protest the peace pact. On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were <b> killed </b> by Tamil rebels near Padaviya village, about 100 <b> miles </b> northeast of Colombo. The peace accord, signed by India and Sri Lanka on July 29, 1987, calls for the <b> government </b> to grant limited autonomy to minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight for a separate Tamil nation. India agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, refused to accept the accord. India is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its own Tamil minority of 60 <b> million </b> for the island conflict. Before the peace pact was signed, Sri Lanka regularly accused India of training and supplying the rebels. More than 8,000 <b> people </b> have been <b> killed </b> since the ethnic war began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 <b> percent </b> of Sri Lanka\\textbackslash{}'s 16 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75 <b> percent </b> and control the <b> government </b> and the army. More than 400 <b> people </b> have been <b> killed </b> since the accord was signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists. Most of the victims have been <b> government </b> officials or members of the governing United National Party of President Junius R. Jayewardene, who signed the accord. </p> 0.551098179376065  \\textbackslash{}n   Eight bombs exploded today in the stronghold of Moslem <b> militants </b> seeking independence for the Himalayan valley of Kashmir, authorities said. No one was injured. Authorities said the blasts, at two banks, a post office and other shops and businesses, occurred hours after fire swept through a shopping complex in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. No one claimed responsibilty for the explosions. Police said they believe the blaze was an accident since it occurred before dawn while a curfew was still in force. But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed the fire and the bombs on the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, the militant group leading the four-decade-old drive for the country\\textbackslash{}'s only Moslem majority <b> state </b> to secede from predominantly Hindu India. India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but says the Kashmiri <b> people </b> have a right to self-determination. At least 82 <b> people </b> have been <b> killed </b> since Jan. 20 in frequent street clashes between <b> militants </b> and security forces in Srinagar and adjoining areas. Most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying curfew imposed by <b> government </b> forces to stem rising violence. The curfew was relaxed during the day from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m., except in the areas where the explosions occurred. Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir. Sixty-four <b> percent </b> of the state\\textbackslash{}'s 5 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> are Moslems, but Moslems make up 12 <b> percent </b> of the 880 <b> million </b> population nationwide. Kashmiri <b> militants </b> had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population, but the <b> militants </b> now demand independence and the status of a neutral country. India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir. </p> 0.532038328268148  \\textbackslash{}n   Police today detained about 10,000 Hindu students on their way to a protest rally in the Kashmir Valley, where a day earlier 21 Moslems were <b> killed </b> in a reported shootout. The caravan of buses and trucks that was stopped in Udhampur, 45 <b> miles </b> north of Jammu, was headed toward Srinagar, where the Hindu activists of the All India Students\\textbackslash{}' Federation had planned to hoist Indian flags. The government, fearing violence, had appealed to the Hindu activists not to hold their procession to Srinagar, a Moslem stronghold in Kashmir, the northern sector of Jammu-Kashmir state. The students, based in Jammu in a predominantly Hindu sector, had ignored the official pleas. The Hindu students are opposed to a Moslem secessionist movement that is attempting to get independence for Jammu-Kashmir state, the only Indian <b> state </b> in which the majority of the population is Moslem. The students were arrested without resistance, one official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. They were expected to be released after a few hours without charges being pressed. In Srinagar, shops were closed and traffic stayed off the roads today in response to a general strike call given by Moslem militants. The strike was to protest the deaths of 21 Kashmiris Tuesday during a shoot-out with paramiltary troops near Srinagar. The <b> government </b> claimed all the victims, including 17 <b> people </b> in a bus which exploded and caught fire, were militants. A <b> government </b> statement said the bus exploded when a stray bullet hit a pile of ammunition inside it. At least 1,175 <b> people </b> have ben <b> killed </b> in Kashmir since January, when the <b> government </b> started a crackdown on the secessionists. About 64 <b> percent </b> of Jammu-Kashmir\\textbackslash{}'s 6 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> are Moslems. About 82 <b> percent </b> of India\\textbackslash{}'s 880 <b> million </b> <b> people </b> are Hindus while Moslems account for 12 percent. </p> 0.521947258258326  \\textbackslash{}n   A bomb hidden in a motor scooter exploded in a crowded vegetable market in Punjab <b> state </b> today, killing at least 31 <b> people </b> and wounding 70 others as Hindus celebrated a religious holiday, police said. The bombing, which police blamed on Sikh separatists, raised to 39 the number <b> killed </b> since Monday in the northern state. Sikhs campaigning for a separate nation have <b> killed </b> more than 500 <b> people </b> so far this year in Punjab, a rich northern farming <b> state </b> where they hold a slight majority over Hindus. Soon after the blast in Batala, 25 <b> miles </b> north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, Hindu mobs hurled stones at a police station 150 yards from the vegetable market, senior police superintendent S.K. Goel said. Goel was unsure whether any policemen were injured. The violence prompted officials to impose an indefinite curfew on the city, he said, adding that ``the situation is very tense.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Most of those <b> killed </b> were Hindus and the wounded included both Sikhs and Hindus, said Sanjeev Gupta, another senior police official. Thirty-two of those wounded were in serious condition. Goel said the bomb exploded during a march by about 100,000 Hindus celebrating the birth of Rama, a heroic warrior-king. Rama is extolled in Hindu lore as an incarnation of Vishnu, a member of the supreme Hindu trinity of gods. Witnesses, contacted by telephone, said portions of bodies were hurled across the market, which was covered with blood-soaked pieces of vegetables. ``Some <b> people </b> were crying for help. Those who were lucky to survive ran away in panic. Many shops, scooters and one car were destroyed,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier today, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near Amritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, both Sikhs, senior police superintendent Anil Sharma said. Police blamed Sikh <b> extremists </b> for the blast near Taragarh, 17 <b> miles </b> northeast of Amritsar. Sikh Extremists initially targeted only Hindus in their campaign but now have also turned their guns on Sikhs who don\\textbackslash{}'t support the separatist cause. On Monday night, Sikh <b> militants </b> shot and <b> killed </b> four members of a Sikh family in another part of Punjab, police said. At Salghowal, 95 <b> miles </b> southeast of Amritsar, five or six Sikh gunmen burst into the farmhouse of a Sikh constable Monday night, killing the policeman, his parents and a younger brother, senior police superintendent Baramjit Singh said. Police also blamed Sikh <b> extremists </b> for an attack on a bus Monday night in Uttar Pradesh state, which is separated from Punjab by Haryana state, news agencies reported. United News of India said one police guard was <b> killed </b> and 11 passengers were wounded when five gunmen stopped the bus. But a second police guard <b> killed </b> one of the gunmen and the others fled, according to United News. Press Trust of India said police recovered a Chinese assault rifle bearing the inscription ``Khalistan Commando Force.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Khalistan, which means ``Land of the Pure,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' is the name Sikh <b> militants </b> use for the independent Sikh nation they want to create in Punjab. The bus was halted while traveling between Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar, about 75 <b> miles </b> northeast of New Delhi and about 95 <b> miles </b> from the Punjab-Haryana <b> state </b> line. Most attacks by Sikh <b> extremists </b> have occurred in Punjab. Nationwide, Sikhs comprise only 2 <b> percent </b> of India\\textbackslash{}'s 880 <b> million </b> people, while Hindus account for 82 percent. The <b> militants </b> say members of the Sikh faith, which has roots in both Islam and Hinduism, are discriminated against politically and culturally by the Hindu majority. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  south north korea korean war roh games communist seoul talks kim sports visit olympic remains peninsula hyundai korea\\textbackslash{}'s delegation team </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.552162424874947  \\textbackslash{}n   South Korea launched regular ferry service with China today for the first time since the Korean <b> peninsula </b> was divided in 1945.

The boat will leave Inchon twice a week, Yonhap said. It will fly a Panamanian flag because the two countries have no diplomatic relations. South Korea has strengthened economic and non-political ties with China, a close ally of Communist North Korea. In recent months it has also increased ties with the Soviet Union and most of the formerly Communist nations in Eastern Europe.

South Korea\\textbackslash{}'s national <b> team </b> won 1-0, but the score was insignificant beside the diplomatic coup in having two enemy nations share a playing field for only the second time since World War II. The first time was two weeks ago in North Korea, when the northern <b> team </b> beat the <b> south </b> 2-1. Today\\textbackslash{}'s crowd was the largest to see a South Korean <b> sports </b> event since the 1988 Olympic Games. At the end of the game, spectators rose for a standing ovation as the athletes jogged around the stadium holding hands and waving. The teams exchanged shirts and waved them in the air. ``Our wish is unification,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' blared a unification song over the loudspeakers. The game, called North-South Unification Soccer, is the high point of a five-day <b> visit </b> by a 78-member North Korean <b> sports </b> delegation, the first from the Communist <b> north </b> to <b> visit </b> the <b> south </b> since the 1945 division of the peninsula. South Korean soccer players visited the <b> north </b> earlier this month. That <b> visit </b> was only the second civilian exchange between the countries in more than four decades. The soccer <b> delegation </b> returns to North Korea on Friday after rounds of sightseeing, dinners and <b> talks </b> on future <b> sports </b> exchanges. South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong Sung and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, agreed in principle to form a joint single <b> team </b> for the 1992 Olympic Games and other international <b> sports </b> events at <b> talks </b> in Pyongyang. They said further discussions would be held in Seoul. About 5,000 plainclothes police were positioned inside and outside the stadium. Spectators were searched twice and passed through metal detectors to get to their seats. Scalpers were asking \\$140 for tickets, 10 times the highest face value price. The teams of the rival Koreas entered the stadium side by side, holding hands and waving to thunderous applause. ``This is not purely <b> sports </b> festival,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Kim said before the match began. ``It should lead to a unification festival.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``I hope this soccer match will be a spring board for national unification,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Chung. Thousands roared in approval and waved colorful pompons. Spectators had been asked not to bring national flags, decorative placards or other paraphernalia which would be identified only with South Korea. A drum and bugle corps played and a gigantic electric signboard flashed the pictures of the ministers. The North Korean <b> team </b> threw half a dozen soccer balls signed with their signatures into the grandstand and screaming spectators raced to retrieve them. During the game, the South Korean crowd cheered wildly for plays by both teams. Radical students, who had said they would root for the North Korean visitors, were not visible. News reports said tickets were sold on an individual basis apparently to avoid large radical or dissident groups sitting together. The <b> sports </b> exchange comes at a time when South Korea and North Korea are seeking to find ways to ease tensions and work together for unification. The prime ministers of both Koreas met for the second time last week in Pyongyang, the north\\textbackslash{}'s capital, and have agreed to meet again in Seoul in December. A South Korean musicians\\textbackslash{}' <b> delegation </b> returns Wednesday from a 10-day <b> visit </b> to the north. The Korean <b> peninsula </b> was divided into the Communist North and capitalist South in 1945 at the end of the World War II. The two nations fought a <b> war </b> in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was never signed. The border between the Koreas <b> remains </b> tightly sealed and is one of the most heavily fortified demarcations in the world with more than 1.5 million troops on either side. </p> 0.486592565118984  \\textbackslash{}n   Last month, Communist North Korea turned over what it said were the <b> remains </b> of five U.S. servicemen killed in the Korean War. Now American officials say they\\textbackslash{}'re not sure whose <b> remains </b> they have. The <b> remains </b> were handed over to to a U.S. congressional <b> delegation </b> in an emotional Memorial Day ceremony in the truce village of Panmunjom in what was billed as the first return of U.S. Korean War dead since 1954. Only two of the five bodies were identified by name by the North Koreans, based on dogtags they said were found with them. They were U.S. Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah and Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, of Chester, Pa. But the United Nations Command said today that the bodies, which were sent to the Army\\textbackslash{}'s Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu for identification, were not those of Saunders and Seaton. ``While North Korea has indicated name association for two of the five remains, dental and physical characteristics of the <b> remains </b> were compared with the dental and physical records of the those two individuals, with negative results,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the command said. The command said its findings were preliminary, but said it did not appear that the other <b> remains </b> returned were those of Saunders or Seaton either. ``Until the identification process is complete, we can\\textbackslash{}'t even be sure they were the <b> remains </b> of Americans,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the command added. The soldiers\\textbackslash{}' relatives have been told of the findings, the command said. The other three sets of <b> remains </b> were not identified by North Korea, but it said at the time of the return that they were believed to be those of another Army servicemen and two U.S. Air Force members. All five were believed to have been prisoners of <b> war </b> who died in Hwanghae Pukto province, <b> south </b> of North Korea\\textbackslash{}'s capital of Pyongyang. Saunders and Seaton had been listed as missing in February 1951, the Pentagon said. According to U.S. military, 8,172 U.S. soldiers remain unaccounted for from the war. The return of the <b> remains </b> was widely seen as a sign of healing and reconciliation after decades of emnity, an effort by North Korea to improve relations with the United States. The two countries do not have diplomatic ties. The United Nations Command says 33,629 U.S. soldiers were killed and 103,284 wounded in the war. More than 2 million Koreans were killed. The 16-nation command, led by an American general, was formed at the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War to help South Korea repel invaders from the North. There were large-scale returns of <b> remains </b> of U.S. <b> war </b> dead in 1953 and 1954. Then, after years of no returns, the North Koreans announced May 14 that they would turn over the <b> remains </b> of the five. Ho Jong, North Korean\\textbackslash{}'s deputy permanant representative at its U.N. mission, said at the time that the Communist government was prepared to discuss the return of more remains. He said the move was an ``eloquent illustration\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of North Korea\\textbackslash{}'s wilingness to ``settle pending issues with the U.S. government in a good way.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' North Korea acknowledged for the first time in January 1988 that it was still holding the <b> remains </b> of U.N. Command <b> war </b> dead. </p> 0.439376559501793  \\textbackslash{}n   Communist North Korea on Friday offered to open a small stretch of its border to promote unification with South Korea, but its capitalist rival dismissed the gesture as insignificant. The Communist overture came as the prime ministers of the two nations prepared to hold historic talks, perhaps as early as August. North Korea announced it would open the northern sector of Panmunjom, a border village, on Aug. 15, according to Naewoe Press, a semi-official South Korean news agency that specializes in Communist affairs. North Korea said the opening, about 800 yards long and 500 yards wide, was aimed at promoting unification of the Korean <b> peninsula </b> and urged South Korea to do the same, according to Naewoe. ``For successful progress of contact and visits between the <b> north </b> and the south, we will open the portion of our side ... and hope that the <b> south </b> side will take a corresponding measure,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the agency quoted the Communist government as saying. The opening, however, would not permit foreigners to travel inland, past the perimeter of Panmunjom, a truce village that straddles part of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas. The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a United Nations Command, comprising the United States and 15 other countries that fought with South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. No civilians may enter the area from either side without approval. South Korea\\textbackslash{}'s Defense Ministry said it had not been officially notified of the north\\textbackslash{}'s plans and would not comment on whether anyone would be allowed to cross the border. But a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity that North Korea\\textbackslash{}'s move was ``insignificant\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' because it affected only a small, restricted section of the heavily fortified border. Other officials said the move was aimed at dividing opinions in South Korea, where dissidents are pushing for free contacts with their Communist neighbors. The South Korean opposition welcomed the announcement. Dissidents asked Seoul to allow 300 people to meet with North Koreans at the border village Aug. 15, the day in 1945 that Korea was freed from Japanese colonial rule. But a spokesman for South Korea\\textbackslash{}'s umbrella dissident group, Chonminyon, said the Seoul response had been negative. The South Korean government bans unauthorized border <b> talks </b> with North Korea. After a five-month suspension, South Korean and North Korean officials have been meeting to discuss an accord that would outline terms for the first <b> talks </b> between their prime ministers. On Tuesday, the Koreas agreed in principle to hold the prime ministers\\textbackslash{}' meeting, possibly in August in Seoul. They agreed to adopt a formal accord July 26. Talks have been held sporadically between the two Koreas, but little progress had been made until recently. The border on both sides is heavily fortified and sealed, blocking exchanges of mail and transportation. North Korea is one of the last totalitarian Communist states, and sweeping changes in Eastern Europe and its socialist allies have made little impact. The two Koreas are still technically at war. No peace treaty has been signed since the three-year Korean War ended in 1953. </p> 0.433794463538924  \\textbackslash{}n   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today accused North Korea of trying to disrupt the Olympic Games and said the United States would beef up its military forces to stop any threat. ``Let me assure you that we will do all we can to help ensure the security of the 1988 Summer Olympics Games,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Communist North Korea continues to threaten peace on the divided Korean <b> peninsula </b> by refusing to work with South Korea to defuse the tension, Carlucci said. ``It is most unfortunate that the <b> north </b> continues its trouble-making role and <b> remains </b> unwilling to make the simple concessions necessary to bring about a reduction in tensions on the peninsula,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Carlucci gave the assurance to South Korean defense officials at the start of the 20th annual U.S.-South Korea security conference to discuss mutual defense. South Korea Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok also stressed the North Korean threat to the <b> south </b> and said the Olympics was adding to the tension. ``With the danger of their scheme to disrupt the coming Olympics remaining undiminished, military tension between <b> south </b> and <b> north </b> on the peninsla continues, thus posing a grave threat to the stability of Northeast Asia,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. U.S. and South Korean delegates agreed during the <b> talks </b> to build up their early warning systems to detect any possible North Korean military threat. Up to three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will help provide security for the Games, officials said. North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the demand, saying the Games are awarded to a single city. The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter opponents that have clashed repeatedly. The United States has about 42,000 U.S. troops based in the <b> south </b> under a mutual defense pact. After meeting with Oh, Carlucci had lunch with President Roh Tae-woo and was awarded the Order of National Security. His scheduled visits later in the day with frontline American and South Korean troops were canceled due to bad weather, officials said. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  spain hijackers crime spanish gunmen owen cain red saturday gotti hostages hijacking o\\textbackslash{}'ferrell mafia suitcase plot italian libya barahona brigades </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.411058162177051  \\textbackslash{}n   Police said they raided a Mafia summit Saturday and arrested five people meeting to draw up new territories for Naples\\textbackslash{}' <b> crime </b> families. The five were charged with criminal association of a Mafia type and with illegal possession of firearms. They are reputed leaders of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia. Authorities said the five met at the apartment of the boss of one Camorra gang and that the apartment had been under surveillance for months. The five were identified as Antonio Egizio, 35; his brother Umberto Egizio, 24; Vincenzo Romano, 28; Vincenzo de Michele, 36; and Salvatore Manna, 44. Police said Antonio Egizio recently sent a letter to President Francesco Cossiga complaining that he was a good person who was continously being persecuted, stopped and followed by the police. </p> 0.387572594340656  \\textbackslash{}n   Reputed mob boss John Gotti was described as ``God\\textbackslash{}'s gift to the underworld\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in tapes secretly recorded by law enforcement agents and played Wednesday to jurors at his assault and conspiracy trial. Prosecutors say Gotti, 49, became boss of the Gambino <b> crime </b> family, largest of New York\\textbackslash{}'s five Mafia factions, in December 1985 after then-boss Paul Castellano was gunned down in front of a steak house. Transcripts of the tapes, which were released to the news media, show Gotti concerned about keeping underlings, including lifelong friends, in their place. At least once on the tapes, Gotti uses the term ``Cosa Nostra\\textbackslash{}' when he is apparently telling an unidentified man that mob soldiers should not address him directly on business matters but should go through their ``capos,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' or captains. The tapes also indicate a relationship with the Westies, a vicious Irish-American gang that operates on Manhattan\\textbackslash{}'s West Side. The Westies are a key factor in Gotti\\textbackslash{}'s trial with associate Anthony Guerrieri, 60, on charges of assault and conspiracy in the 1986 revenge shooting of John F. O\\textbackslash{}'Connor, former vice president of a Carpenters Union local. Gotti is accused of commissioning the Westies to shoot and wound O\\textbackslash{}'Connor because the union leader had thugs trash a restaurant owned by Gotti associate Philip ``Philly\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Modica. The transcripts show at least one mention by Gotti of the restaurant and several comments on the Westies. At one point Gotti says ``...they\\textbackslash{}'re doing something for me them Irish guys...,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' but does not say what. At another point, Gotti refers to James Coonan as ``my friend\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' who is ``the leader of the West Side gang, Irish guys.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He also says, ``He\\textbackslash{}'s on the payroll, and he gets it legitimately ...\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The tapes were introduced by Edward Wright, an investigator with the state\\textbackslash{}'s Organized Crime Task Force. Wright said the alleged mobsters, suspecting they might be under surveillance, turned on hair dryers, flushed toilets, whispered and used other means to try to make conversations inaudible. The tapes were made from listening devices placed in Gotti\\textbackslash{}'s hangout in the borough of Qeens and monitored by police between June 19, 1985, and Feb. 26, 1986. More than 1,000 cassettes were recorded, prosecutors say. One 1986 tape shows Gotti in a telephone conversation quoting someone who praised him: ``When they say God\\textbackslash{}'s gift to the underworld, you are it. ``He speaks with his heart,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gotti said on the telephone. ``He means it. I tell ya something, I love the guy.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' On another tape, Gotti expressed annoyance with lifelong friend Angelo Ruggiero for his familiarity during business hours. ``I told Ange, `You gotta forget them liberties you take. Take `em when we\\textbackslash{}'re alone,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gotti said. Gotti apparently had just made Ruggiero a ``caporegime,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' or crew captain, according to the tape transcripts, and was not satisfied that his friend was acting like a leader. Ruggiero, a defendant in the O\\textbackslash{}'Connor case with Gotti, died of natural causes last month. </p> 0.317650341569912  \\textbackslash{}n   The Town Council has resigned to protest reports its members are suspected of ties with the Mafia. The councilmen followed the lead of the mayor, Paolo Scarna. He quit after a nephew was suspected of killing a judge last month who was ruling on whether purported Mafia members should be kept under house arrest, news reports said Friday. The resignations of the 32 council members came amid reports that police were investigating local politicians for possible links with organized crime. The town of 25,000 people, one of the poorest in Sicily, is in the province of Agrigento, an area that over the last few years has seen many slayings linked to the mob, including the murder of two anti-Mafia magistrates. Italy\\textbackslash{}'s top anti-Mafia fighter, Magistrate Domenico Sica, has looked into possible Mafia activity in the town. In Palermo, meanwhile, officials announced on Friday that police have arrested 12 people suspected of drug-trafficking and money-laundering. The arrests came in a nationwide sweep that began Thursday night and involved searches of houses and business offices in Palermo, Rome, Milan and the northern cities of Como and Asti, police officials said. Those arrested were held for investigation of suspected organized <b> crime </b> ties that involved drug dealing and money laundering. Investigators said they were aided by the testimony of a former mobster-turned-informer and by the discovery in January of a ledger that police say contained entries on Mafia financial transactions. The ledger was found in the house of a fugitive suspected Mafia boss. The drugs appeared to have moved directly from Turkey to Sicily and the drug profits appeared to have been laundered through Swiss banks, the Italian news agency AGI reported. </p> 0.313418487504187  \\textbackslash{}n   Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, a close friend and adviser of Premier Ciriaco De Mita, was shot to death Saturday at his home in northern Italy. An anonymous caller said Red Brigades terrorists were responsible. Investigators told Italian news agencies the body of the 51-year-old Christian Democrat senator was found on a couch in his living room at Forli, 40 miles southeast of Bologna. They said he was shot in the back of the neck. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said an anonymous telephone caller to the Bologna office of the Rome newspaper La Repubblica asserted responsibility on behalf of the Red Brigades. The spokesman quoted the caller as saying, ``We have killed Senator Ruffilli, attacking at the heart of the state. Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' President Francesco Cossiga said: ``Our institutions and all the forces that are alive in the country will know how to act with firmness for the defense of liberty and of right. ``The assassination of Sen. Roberto Ruffilli is a horrendous <b> crime </b> against the most sacred of human values \\_ life. It is an abominable attack on the parliamentary and representative institutions which are the fulcrum of our democratic state.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Maurizio Laudi, a magistrate who has investigated the terrorist group, was quoted by the news agency AGI as saying the Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party is the most dangerous and active group in what remains of the Red Brigades. He said it also is the most difficult to penetrate. AGI said Ruffilli had received threatening phone calls in recent days. He led the Christian Democrat committee on problems of the state and was working with the premier on institutional reform. Ruffilli also was on the parliamentary commission that investigated the P-2 Masonic Lodge scandal. Premier De Mita convened a special meeting Saturday night of Interior Minister Antonio Gava and the chiefs of the Italy\\textbackslash{}'s police forces. ``The criminal warning of the terrorists could not have been any clearer,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``It has the same clarity with which 10 years ago through the person of Aldo Moro they aimed at his political program.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Red Brigades terrorists kidnapped and killed Moro, a former premier, in 1978. According to the news agency ANSA, investigators at Ruffilli\\textbackslash{}'s home found the door open and no signs of forced entry. State-run RAI television said the assassins fled on foot after the shooting at about 1 p.m. In a dispatch quoting government sources it did not identify, AGI said the car bombing that killed five people and wounded 17 at a Naples club for U.S. military personnel Thursday night may have inspired terrorists to kill Rufilli. An American servicewoman and four Italians were killed in the blast. The murder of air force Gen. Licio Giorgieri in Rome on March 20, 1987, was the last terrorist act for which a branch of the Red Brigades claimed responsibility. A month before that, the Red Brigades for the Formation of Fighting Communist Party claimed responsibility for an armored car robbery in Rome. In December 1981, Red Brigade terrorists disguised as plumbers kidnapped U.S. Brig. Gen. James Dozier, who was with the NATO command in Italy, from his home in Verona. He was rescued 42 days later by a special police unit in Padua. In February 1984, terrorists in Rome fatally shot Leamon Hunt, a U.S. diplomat and director-general of the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. The Red Brigades claimed responsibility. </p> 0.301221604585091  \\textbackslash{}n   The bulk of one of the world\\textbackslash{}'s most important private art collections will hang in Spain for at least 10 years under an agreement signed Thursday. The arrival of 700 to 800 of the \\$2 billion Thyssen collection\\textbackslash{}'s most significant paintings will cement the Spanish capital\\textbackslash{}'s reputation as a leading world art center. The agreement was signed by collector Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and the Spanish government. The ceremony took place across the street from Prado museum in the 19th-century Villahermosa Palace, which Spanish authorities are refurbishing to devote exclusively to the new works. The collection is expected to open to the public in November. Thyssen said his decision to chose Spain over museums in the United States, Switzerland and West Germany was ``completely objective\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' but stressed that his ties to Spain played a deciding role. The Baron\\textbackslash{}'s fifth wife, Spanish-born Carmen Cervera, was an important factor in the final decision, according one of the plan\\textbackslash{}'s chief architects, the Duke of Badajoz, who also is the brother-in-law of King Juan Carlos. Cervera, a former beauty queen and widow of ``Tarzan\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' actor Lex Barker, ``has a great influence over her husband,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. The duke said Thyssen had not yet completed the choice of which paintings would make up the Madrid collection, but the agreement stipulates they include ``the most significant paintings\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of the Thyssen collection. The duke said the 10-year loan agreement paves the way for a second pact to make Spain the collection\\textbackslash{}'s permanent home. ``It takes away a bit of the tension,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``Now we can proceed with calm to work out the definitive agreement.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' A beaming Culture Minister Javier Solana said the collection ``is going to fundamentally improve the cultural life of our country.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Swiss-based Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Trust, headed by the baron, owns 1,600 paintings from the 13th to 20th centuries, including 570 old masters. The collection was started by his father, Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a German steel baron who died in 1947. News that Thyssen was looking for a bigger home for the bulk of the paintings currently housed at his Villa Favorita residence in Lugano, Switzerland, elicited offers from Spain, the Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., and museums in several West German cities. The 10-year loan is to be administered by a private foundation set up by the Spanish government and Thyssen, and chaired by the baron. The agreement stipulates that the pieces on loan to Spain will be able to travel freely to other museums without prior approval from Spanish authorities. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  dollar yen late london gold bid ounce dealers fell trading troy bank tokyo price west rates francs currency compared close </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.895672441142999  \\textbackslash{}n   The <b> dollar </b> <b> fell </b> against most major currencies in European <b> trading </b> today.

As a former Democratic president, Carter is a delegate to the <b> convention </b> in Atlanta this summer.

James Thompson came to this <b> convention </b> city to taunt the Democrats, but wound up hinting that he\\textbackslash{}'d make a good <b> running </b> mate for GOP candidate George Bush. As the Democrats embraced the ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, who differ on a number of issues, Thompson stressed his compatibility with the <b> vice </b> president. ``George Bush and I agree on a lot of things,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Thompson, a four-term governor who was an early Bush supporter. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m too moderate for some people, but I\\textbackslash{}'ve never been <b> told </b> I\\textbackslash{}'m too moderate for George Bush,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Thompson was careful to avoid sounding overly eager as a job applicant.

Since then, Thompson has been mentioned as a <b> vice </b> <b> presidential </b> prospect, and ``Thompson-Bush\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' bumper stickers have appeared in Springfield, the Illinois capital. Thompson was in Atlanta on Wednesday to carry the GOP banner. He clearly relished the task, signaling what\\textbackslash{}'s certain to be a Republican effort to focus attention on Jesse Jackson as part of the Democratic team. ``Gov. Dukakis has accepted Jesse Jackson as his partner in this campaign, elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps higher than his nominal <b> running </b> mate, Lloyd Bentsen,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Thompson <b> told </b> reporters. Thompson said it was a clever strategy by Dukakis to offer Bentsen as ``the soothing, reassuring conservative.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But he said, ``my guess is those two partners of the troika, Dukakis and Jackson, will soon leave Bentsen in the dust.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Thompson added: ``With Bentsen whispering in one ear and Jackson whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen to? ...

He recalled the brokered 1952 <b> convention </b> that nominated Adlai Stevenson and said, ``It was enjoyable ... it makes it more fun.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``If I had my way \\_ they talk about the smoke-filled rooms \\_ we ought to open them up to the TV and the press,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said in an interview Wednesday night. Sen. Paul Simon\\textbackslash{}'s favorite-son <b> primary </b> victory in Illinois on Tuesday brought the brokered <b> convention </b> speculation to the fore, along with concerns that the Democrats could only be hurt by such a lack of unity. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who some hope would emerge the nominee if there were a deadlocked convention, condemned the possibility as ``the best way to give this election away to the Republicans.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He joined Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk in calling for the Democratic leadership to unify behind the front-runner when the <b> primary </b> season ends in June, rather than wait until the July <b> convention </b> in Atlanta. Simon, reviving his faltering campaign, took most of the <b> delegates </b> in Illinois, with the other home-state candidate, Jesse Jackson, coming in second and taking the rest of the delegates. Simon said no one will have enough <b> delegates </b> to lock up the nomination before the convention, and added, ``We\\textbackslash{}'re going to have to work out some kind of a compromise.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who currently holds a slim lead in delegates, said the party should unite behind the front-runner at the end of the <b> primary </b> season, and that encouraging a brokered <b> convention </b> ``would be a very dangerous thing.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``I think there is agreement on the part of most Democrats across the country that somebody will come out of this <b> primary </b> process with, if not an absolute majority, a substantial plurality ... and that people will rally behind that person. Obviously, I hope I will be that person,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the governor said in Boston. But other prominent Democrats, interviewed Wednesday at a congressional dinner, professed not to be worried about the deadlocked <b> convention </b> prospect, mostly because they don\\textbackslash{}'t think it will come to that. ``Nobody said the process had to end by March,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But he said he thinks his candidate, Dukakis, will have enough <b> delegates </b> to take the nomination by June, and that ``the process is going to work its way out.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, who opted not to seek the <b> presidential </b> nomination this year, said he doubts anyone will have a winning cache of <b> delegates </b> in June. But he predicted that the party would unite behind a candidate before the convention. Nonetheless, he added, ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t fear a brokered <b> convention </b> ... I don\\textbackslash{}'t think any harm comes from it.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' After Illinois, Dukakis had 464.5 delegate votes, Jackson 460.55 and Simon 171.5. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee had 354.8 and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri 145. Uncommitted <b> delegates </b> totaled 272.65 of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination. Boosted by his Illinois win, Simon plans to <b> campaign </b> vigorously for the upcoming Michigan caucuses March 26 and the Wisconsin <b> primary </b> April 5. Gore, who fared poorly in Illinois, said he is ``almost prepared\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to agree that the race will still be fluid at the convention. ``I still think this process is likely to produce a winner before the first ballot is over,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gore said. ``The results (from Illinois) ... make it more likely we will go to a second ballot.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gephardt, who skipped Illinois to try to resuscitate his <b> campaign </b> in Michigan, said the Democratic battle could go all the way. ``The race is wide open,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``I think if I can get a good result in Michigan, which I think I can, I\\textbackslash{}'m going to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great chance to be the nominee.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said Wednesday night he anticipated he would be involved in any discussions to unite behind a candidate before the <b> convention </b> if no one had the winning number of <b> delegates </b> in June. He said a brokered <b> convention </b> wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t be the worst thing, but added, ``All things considered, it would be desirable if it didn\\textbackslash{}'t happen.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey on Wednesday signaled the likelihood that he, too, would help in early selection of a nominee. First, he <b> told </b> party leaders in his home <b> state </b> that he would endorse a candidate before the <b> primary </b> there June 7, with Dukakis the favorite for his backing. And he said party leaders should halt an effort to put together an uncommitted delegate slate for the state. Victory for such a slate, he said, could cause problems for the front-running candidate when the <b> primary </b> is held. </p> 0.479709693591917  \\textbackslash{}n   Michael Dukakis, the clear Democratic front-runner after beating Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. in New York, said today the party\\textbackslash{}'s runner-up after the primaries won\\textbackslash{}'t necessarily be the <b> vice </b> <b> presidential </b> choice. Gore, conceding ``things didn\\textbackslash{}'t turn out exactly as I planned,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' suspended his <b> campaign </b> but said he would hang on to the <b> delegates </b> he\\textbackslash{}'s won so far. ``I want no part of a stop-Jackson or stop-Dukakis movement. The only man I want to stop is George Bush and we\\textbackslash{}'re going to stop George Bush, Gore said, bringing applause from supporters at a news conference in a Senate office building. ``Technically, I shall remain a candidate for the nomination but only to enable my <b> delegates </b> to go to the <b> convention </b> so they can represent our point of view in our party\\textbackslash{}'s deliberations,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Gore, the youngest candidate in the race, joked that in the campaign, ``I was doing great until I turned 40.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Jackson, in Pennsylvania, brushed aside surveys suggesting he faces an uphill fight in next week\\textbackslash{}'s <b> primary </b> in that state. ``I do not follow opinion polls, I mold opinion,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Jackson <b> told </b> cheering supporters in Philadelphia. Gore\\textbackslash{}'s decision to merely suspend his <b> campaign </b> followed a similar action by Sen. Paul Simon earlier. Both Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning today in Pennsylvania, where 178 Democratic <b> delegates </b> are at stake on Tuesday. Dukakis was going on to Ohio, which holds its <b> primary </b> a week later. Dukakis, asked about a potential <b> running </b> mate during an interview with The Associated Press, said, ``I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks as if it\\textbackslash{}'s pretty well in hand.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Some Jackson backers were beginning to float the idea of Jackson as a possible <b> running </b> mate if Dukakis were the nominee. ``There would be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' <b> campaign </b> chairman Willie Brown <b> told </b> The New York Times. But Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said such a ticket was unlikely. Kirk, in comments published in today\\textbackslash{}'s Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said, ``Only once in 19 elections since the turn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placed second and asked him to run. It was 1960.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dukakis himself said, ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t entitle me to anything more than consideration, period.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer questions about the <b> vice </b> presidency away from Jackson. ``The nominee makes that decision \\_ as he (Jackson) himself said. And rightly so,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dukakis said. On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush continued his march to the nomination, with 1,052 of the 1,139 <b> delegates </b> needed to nominate. Bush was endorsed Wednesday by California Gov. George Deukmejian, who had initially pledged neutrality through the June 7 California primary. But Bush\\textbackslash{}'s only remaining competitor is Pat Robertson, who has all but halted his campaign. Simon\\textbackslash{}'s suspension of his Democratic <b> presidential </b> <b> campaign </b> earlier this month drew fire from Jackson, who complained bitterly about the Illinois\\textbackslash{}' senator\\textbackslash{}'s decision to keep a lock on <b> delegates </b> that would otherwise have gone to him. Jackson <b> campaign </b> spokesman Bob Brosage brushed aside talk of Jackson as <b> vice </b> president. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re still <b> running </b> for president,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``There are significant primaries to come.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' And Jackson himself gave no indication he\\textbackslash{}'s giving up his drive for the nomination. ``We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he <b> told </b> an enthusiastic crowd of 3,500 at a Philadelphia rally. Jackson was also picking up the endorsement today of the Philadelphia Daily News. A survey commissioned by the newspaper, in concert with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, suggested this week that Dukakis had a 3-1 lead in the state. Even so, ``Jesse Jackson can win,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the Daily News said in an editorial. Financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission indicated Jackson had his best fund-raising month ever in March, raising \\$2.8 million. But Dukakis, whose <b> campaign </b> has been well bankrolled all along, raised \\$3.4 million during the same period. Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s stops in Pennsylvania today ranged from a high school to a labor rally to a homeless shelter. Dukakis was heading for Pittsburgh tonight, after spending a day in Boston following the New York primary. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, at a Democratic dinner in Washington Wednesday night, was eager to move beyond the raucous contest in his home state. ``I expect the <b> campaign </b> will be converted to an intelligent, civilized exchange of opinions,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Dukakis is comfortably ahead of Jackson in the delegate count, getting a boost Wednesday from the selection of congressional ``super delegates.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The latest Associated Press delegate count gives Dukakis 1,063.15; Jackson 841.1; Gore 421.55; and uncommitted 613.75, out of 2,081 needed to nominate. But Dukakis was doing his best to dampen any talk of inevitability. When he was introduced at a Statehouse reception in Massachusetts as ``the next president of the United States,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he grinned but quickly cautioned: ``Steady as she goes.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In one respect, however, Dukakis was behaving as if he were the nominee, focusing attacks on Bush, who is all but certain to carry the GOP banner in the fall. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m a doer,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dukakis said Wednesday, saying that characteristic stands in ``sharp contrast to the Republican nominee.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.451467600268355  \\textbackslash{}n   Democratic <b> presidential </b> contender Michael Dukakis said today at the White House that the Reagan administration\\textbackslash{}'s anti-terrorist policy is worthless because of arms dealing with Iran. In the Midwest Republican Bob Dole taunted George Bush for refusing to compete in Minnesota and South Dakota. Dukakis, speaking to reporters after a National Governors\\textbackslash{}' Association meeting with the president, said, ``I\\textbackslash{}'d have a much tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Massachusetts governor, referring to the sale of arms to Iran during secret negotiations to free American hostages, said, ``We\\textbackslash{}'ll be living with the consequences of what happened in 1985 for a long time.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless. And that\\textbackslash{}'s what we did,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Dukakis. Asked about Dukakis\\textbackslash{}' statement, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I think it\\textbackslash{}'s very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you\\textbackslash{}'re talking about specific episodes. Vice President Bush, who has said repeatedly he supported Reagan\\textbackslash{}'s Iran initiative but was involved with few details, was campaigning in South Carolina today. But Dole, in Duluth, Minn., was suggesting Bush wasn\\textbackslash{}'t where he should have been. Minnesota and South Dakota, the next two events on the long road to the 1988 <b> presidential </b> nominations, vote on Tuesday. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re ready to do well here tomorrow. We\\textbackslash{}'re here to play,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dole <b> told </b> supporters in Duluth today. ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t know where George Bush is,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dole said. ``I didn\\textbackslash{}'t find him yesterday in Wyoming. Couldn\\textbackslash{}'t find him in South Dakota. Couldn\\textbackslash{}'t find him in Minnesota. Must be somewhere. And these are very important states. Later today we\\textbackslash{}'re going to send him a map of Minnesota so at least he gets a little idea where it is.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Among the Democrats, Richard Gephardt, who also finished first in Iowa, is bidding for a strong showing in South Dakota\\textbackslash{}'s Democratic straw poll to give him a boost as the <b> campaign </b> moves toward the Super Tuesday showdown on March 8. The 4,067 Minnesota caucuses are the first step toward choosing 78 <b> delegates </b> to the Democratic National Convention, while on the Republican side caucus attendees will mark a non-binding straw ballot to express their <b> presidential </b> preference. In South Dakota\\textbackslash{}'s primary, Republican voters will determine allocation of 18 <b> convention </b> delegates, while the Democrats will hold a beauty contest ballot that will not have a binding effect on who gets the state\\textbackslash{}'s national <b> convention </b> delegates. Bush, faced with the potential of a repeat of the Iowa results in which Midwesterner Dole was a big winner, is concentrating on the South where he hopes to cripple the Kansas senator\\textbackslash{}'s effort. Dole is a strong favorite in South Dakota, while Minnesota is shaping up as a three-way fight between Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former television evangelist Pat Robertson. Dukakis, winner of the New Hampshire Democratic <b> presidential </b> primary, is campaigning hard in both these upper Midwest states in an effort to prove he can win <b> support </b> outside his native New England. After an appearance at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, including a session with President Reagan, Dukakis was flying to Minnesota to campaign. On his way into the White House for a black-tie dinner Sunday night, Dukakis quipped, ``I\\textbackslash{}'m just looking the place over, that\\textbackslash{}'s all.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Asked where he hoped to be next year, Dukakis replied, ``I hope right here.\\textbackslash{}' Gephardt, who has made tough action to correct trade imbalances a cornerstone of his campaign, got a blow from his House colleagues when words came out they planned to scuttle his legislation that would impose sanctions on countries that maintain large trade surpluses with the United States through unfair practices. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re going to dump it because it\\textbackslash{}'s bad policy,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the Trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m going to fight for my amendment,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Gephardt, when <b> told </b> of the plan. Much of the sniping between <b> presidential </b> rivals was being done by long distance. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who made little effort in Iowa and not much more in New Hampshire while pursuing a Southern strategy for the Democratic nomination, was interviewed on the NBC show ``Meet the Press\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on Sunday and got in jabs at both Dukakis and Gephardt. The senator attacked Gephardt for shifting positions. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s not a case of just having one or two or three issues where he has changed 180 degrees,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Gore. ``There is a long, long list of issues.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Turning to Dukakis, Gore said the governor has not had ``a single day\\textbackslash{}'s experience in foreign policy.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dukakis\\textbackslash{}' spokesman Leslie Dach quickly retorted that ``Al Gore\\textbackslash{}'s never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building an economy.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gephardt was attacking Dukakis in ads <b> running </b> in South Dakota that criticize the Massachusetts governor for not supporting farm legislation sponsored by Gephardt and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. The ads also take a shot at Dukakis for once suggesting in Iowa that farmers ought to consider diversifying into such crops as Belgian endive. The ads drew retorts from Dukakis supporters in both Minnesota and South Dakota. ``A new low in South Dakota <b> presidential </b> politics,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said State Sen. Roger McKellips, a co-chairman of Dukakis\\textbackslash{}' South Dakota campaign. After his surprising second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Robertson was considered a strong contender in Minnesota where caucus organization is once again important.

One of the triggers to last year\\textbackslash{}'s uprisings at federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was the fact that the government was taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were deemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for the detainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble finding halfway house space for the detainees. From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in November, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released 106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A total of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances. INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots. Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the denials have been decided since the uprisings. When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detainees in various facilities. The Justice Department also announced it plans to repatriate 14 Mariel Cubans, the first group of detainees designated for return to Cuba since the prison disturbances. The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences for crimes committed in the United States, have been notified that the INS intends to send them back, the Justice Department said. Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of crimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape. The repatriation process will include a review of their cases by a Justice Department review panel under an agreement which ended the rioting at Atlanta and Oakdale. Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to submit additional information on their behalf to the Justice Department review panels, which specifically exclude <b> immigration </b> officers. </p> 0.376502286739609  \\textbackslash{}n   A 101-year-old Mexican who was smuggled into the United States in the back seat of his son\\textbackslash{}'s car 14 years ago became the oldest alien to gain legal status under the amnesty program, officials said Friday. ``Gracias, muchas gracias a todos (Thank you very much everyone),\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Carlos Romero-Gaitan said as he was presented a temporary residency permit, or green card, by Howard Ezell, western regional director the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In recent weeks, Ezell and other INS officials have taken pains to publicize the impending May 4 deadline to <b> apply </b> for amnesty. Romero-Gaitan, who was born in San Pedro, worked on a hacienda and as a rodeo rider, and operated a Guadalajara tortilla shop until his retirement at age 82 in 1968. When his wife died in 1974, his son Carlos Jr. of Watsonville, Calif., flew to Guadalajara and took him by plane to Tijuana, where they got into a waiting car.

CTK quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the grace period should permit Havana ``to cope with the new situation, without jeopardizing its interests in the U.S.A.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Czechoslovak Embassy has represented Cuban interests in Washington since 1977. Diplomatic and consular ties between Cuba and the United States were severed in January 1961. Interests sections enable countries to maintain <b> diplomatic </b> contact without having to have full-fledged embassies. A senior Cuban <b> diplomatic </b> official in Washington, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the Cuban government has no alternate plan in mind at present to replace the current arrangement with the Czechoslovak government. He said he assumes both the Cuban and U.S. governments wish to maintain a <b> diplomatic </b> presence in each other\\textbackslash{}'s capital and that Cuba will seek a new arrangement. The official said he had seen news reports about Prague\\textbackslash{}'s decision but had heard nothing officially. U.S. <b> diplomatic </b> activities in Havana have been carried out under the auspices of the Swiss embassy. One <b> diplomatic </b> source suggested that Cuba may ask the Swiss to perform that function for Cuba in Washington. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry source as saying that ``the different opinions of the two countries on the exercising of human rights\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and other fundamental differences prompted the Czechoslovak decision. Czechoslovakia has become a democracy following the revolution that toppled the Communist leadership one year ago; Cuba remains Communist-ruled. The ministry source suggested that deteriorating relations after Czechoslovakia embraced democracy contributed to Prague\\textbackslash{}'s decision, CTK said.

Gary Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed by the Justice Department that there would be an announcement Thursday on the prisoners. Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in Miami and Atlanta plan to ask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried out would mark the first time Cubans have been deported to their <b> communist </b> homeland since May 1985, The Miami Herald reported. ``There is a chance if we all speak with one <b> united </b> voice here and explain the merits of our case,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Rafael Penalver, chairman of the Task Force of Cuban American Citizen Organizations. Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in Oakdale, La., and at an Atlanta prison last November. ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He can block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the airport.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' A special three-member Justice Department panel was created in the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Mariel detainees in federal prison in Talladega, Ala. In the past two months, the panel has looked at prison records, <b> immigration </b> history, written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but there have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers. Deportations to Cuba were reinstated as part of a renewed <b> immigration </b> pact between the United States and Cuba that allows up to 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families to emigrate and, in return, the Cuban government will take back 2,500 prisoners. The Justice Department contends that these prisoners are criminals the Cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from the port of Mariel. Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of Mariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984 <b> immigration </b> pact. Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, acknowledges there is much division over the deporations, even in Dade County\\textbackslash{}'s Cuban exile community. He said the foundation favors letting Cubans <b> apply </b> for visas to immigrate to the United States but opposes the deportations to Cuba. ``I cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation in Cuba and then support sending them back,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mas said. </p> 0.363299074150423  \\textbackslash{}n   An attorney for 13 Cuban detainees argued Tuesday they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylum before being sent back to the homeland they fled in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Lee Ochoa of Miami, an attorney for 13 of 15 Cubans convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, told U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon that some of the Cubans were afraid to go home because they did not know how they would be treated by Fidel Castro\\textbackslash{}'s government. Clemon said he will rule Monday on whether to allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to fly the 13 back to Cuba. Clemon said he wanted to give attorneys for the Cubans time to support their request for a preliminary order blocking the deportation. The INS on Nov. 17 notified 15 Cubans at at the Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega that they would be deported within 72 hours. However, the next day the government promised Clemon it would not send them home until their attorneys had a chance to study their files. Leo Ochoa of Miami, attorney for 13 of the 15, told Clemon that they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym and to due process. ``In this country we want to do things fairly and properly,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ochoa said. But Lauri Fillppu of the INS said that the Cubans\\textbackslash{}' only claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in Cuba. He said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court in Atlanta already had rejected that argument. Fillppu questioned what he called ``a last-minute tactic\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' by the Cubans, claiming there was no new evidence. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  cents farmers cent lower prices higher futures corn agriculture tons grain wheat bushel market crop farm drought soybean agricultural production </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.77791170723425  \\textbackslash{}n   Grain and <b> soybean </b> <b> futures </b> <b> prices </b> were mixed in volatile early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.

They headed for Maggie and Blackbird, two pure-bred <b> cows </b> awaiting artificial insemination by a \\$770,000, prize-winning Angus bull named Broadway. Since the bulls, aged 9 and 13 months, may have beaten Broadway\\textbackslash{}'s time with the cows, the cows\\textbackslash{}' owners were advised to wait 60 to 90 days before artificial insemination, to make sure Broadway was the father. Though this was done, the owners are suing Kirk Hardin, caretaker of the bulls and cows, for \\$39,000, accusing him of negligence in not keeping the guys and gals apart. Lonnie Pembrook, owner of Pembrook Cattle Co. near Fairview, and Tom Young, a New Jersey businessman, each owned a half-interest in Blackbird. Pembrook owns Maggie. Hardin, a specialist in artificial insemination and embryo transfer techniques, contends the fence mishap, in the fall of 1986, was an ``act of God\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that could not have been prevented or foreseen. The trial began Monday before a Payne County jury, and testimony ended Tuesday. Closing arguments are scheduled Friday.

Miss Taylor walked across the courtroom surrounded by her lawyers and made no acknowledgement of former beau Henry Wynberg, seated at the opposite end of a table. A panel of 50 prospective jurors sat with their eyes riveted on the actress, dressed in purple, as the judge explained what the trial was all about. Miss Taylor won permission earlier in the day to tell jurors about Wynberg\\textbackslash{}'s criminal record after her lawyers said it would explain her decision to keep him out of her perfume business. Lawyers for Henry Wynberg sought to prevent jurors from hearing that Wynberg - who courted Miss Taylor between her two marriages to Richard Burton - once pleaded guilty to statutory rape, providing drugs to underage high school girls in return for sex and taking pornographic photos of young girls. They called the evidence ``irrelevant, inflammatory and prejudicial.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But Miss Taylor\\textbackslash{}'s lawyers argued that those issues were crucial to proving that she was justified in breaking off her business relationship with Wynberg ``because any reputable cosmetics company would refuse to deal with Wynberg.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart declined to bar the evidence. Wynberg claims he conceived the actress\\textbackslash{}' line of ``Passion\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' perfume, and he\\textbackslash{}'s seeking a hefty share of the profits. He says he created the fragrance under the Elizabeth Taylor Cosmetics Inc. banner. At stake: about \\$70 million a year in profits. Litigation has produced volumes of depositions and affidavits about Wynberg\\textbackslash{}'s claim that he had a contract with Miss Taylor for exclusive rights to her name and likeness for promotion and sale of cosmetics. Wynberg sued in 1986 for 72 percent of ``Passion\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' profits. Court documents show Wynberg\\textbackslash{}'s two-year romance with the violet-eyed actress ended in August 1975, when Miss Taylor said, ``I\\textbackslash{}'m going back to Richard, Henry. I\\textbackslash{}'ll see you later.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Burton and Miss Taylor remarried in Africa, and Wynberg returned to California. Court records show that a short time later, Miss Taylor and Wynberg signed the cosmetics agreement in Switzerland, with Burton as a witness. Wynberg said he spent years consulting with chemists and manufacturers, smelling perfumes and looking for the perfect bottle. ``I wanted sparkling little lights like stars in there, and I wanted it to look like money, feel like money,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Wynberg said. According to Wynberg, Hen he presented the actress with the heart-shaped bottle and fragrance in November 1983, Miss Taylor said: ``Let\\textbackslash{}'s let bygones be bygones, Henry. Let\\textbackslash{}'s split 50-50 on the perfume deal.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In a deposition, Miss Taylor denies Wynberg\\textbackslash{}'s assertion. ``I didn\\textbackslash{}'t want to do any business with him,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. Miss Taylor contends that Wynberg\\textbackslash{}'s failure to follow through on the project violated the contract and made it invalid. In 1986 she signed with the Chesebrough-Ponds Inc. cosmetics company to market ``Passion\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' using her name and likeness.

GM barely broke even building cars and trucks in North America in 1987, reaping \\$3.56 <b> billion </b> in 1987 <b> profit </b> from accounting changes, tax benefits and record contributions from its streamlined overseas businesses and its subsidiaries. But second-quarter revenue for the nation\\textbackslash{}'s biggest automaker rose 12 <b> percent </b> to \\$29.9 <b> billion </b> from \\$26.7 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> ago, breaking the previous quarterly record of \\$27.6 <b> billion </b> set in 1986 when the auto <b> industry </b> set a 16.3 million-vehicle annual <b> sales </b> record. GM <b> reported </b> net <b> earnings </b> of \\$1.5 billion, or \\$4.52 a common share, up from \\$1.17 billion, or \\$3.39 a common share, in the second <b> quarter </b> a <b> year </b> ago. ``It was a good quarter. The number of units produced per employee went up almost 17 <b> percent </b> versus second-quarter last year. That\\textbackslash{}'s phenomenally good, showing the kind of <b> earnings </b> General Motors can have if <b> sales </b> pick up,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Ronald Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco. Car and light truck <b> sales </b> in 1988 have continued to surge well ahead of pessimistic predictions issued in the wake of the October 1987 stock <b> market </b> crisis. Expectations for the <b> year </b> have risen to a consensus of about 15.6 <b> million </b> vehicles, and GM has benefited from the industry\\textbackslash{}'s surprisingly strong performance. ``Last year, (sales) volume was so low that most of their gains came from accounting changes. This year, it seems based on volume. Sales were strong in the first half, particularly in the second quarter,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Kathleen Heaney, analyst with Nikko Securities International in New York. Second-quarter revenue rose 12 <b> percent </b> from a <b> year </b> ago and broke the previous GM record for any <b> quarter </b> of \\$27.6 <b> billion </b> set in 1986, GM said. The <b> earnings </b> were the best for any <b> quarter </b> since second <b> quarter </b> 1984. GM also said that as of June 30, it had shaved \\$2.7 <b> billion </b> of the \\$4 <b> billion </b> it plans to trim from its costs during 1988. In the second quarter, operating income rose 64 percent, to \\$1.75 <b> billion </b> from \\$1.07 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> earlier. It rose 16 <b> percent </b> in the first six months, to \\$2.4 <b> billion </b> from \\$2.08 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> ago. GM said the improvement came both from a return to stronger profitability in North America and overseas performance stronger than last year\\textbackslash{}'s record. However, GM said it does not provide income for different geographic areas on a quarterly basis. GM\\textbackslash{}'s worldwide vehicle <b> sales </b> rose 9.3 <b> percent </b> in the second quarter, to 2.25 million. At the end of the second quarter, GM\\textbackslash{}'s North American-built cars and light trucks held 35.1 <b> percent </b> of the U.S. market, up slightly from 33.8 <b> percent </b> at the end of June 1987. In the first six months of 1988, GM <b> earnings </b> rose 13.3 <b> percent </b> to \\$2.6 billion, or \\$7.63 a share, on revenue of \\$56.34 <b> billion </b> from \\$2.29 billion, or \\$6.65 a share, on revenue of \\$52.8 <b> billion </b> a <b> year </b> ago. On Wednesday, GM <b> reported </b> <b> earnings </b> by its three subsidiaries \\_ General Motors Acceptance Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp., and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. GM blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings for an 18.9 <b> percent </b> drop in GMAC earnings.

While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is trying to develop a simpler test that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown AIDS, said the CDC\\textbackslash{}'s Janet Nicholson. Such a test would help <b> doctors </b> decide when the benefits of giving <b> patients </b> certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks, said Dr. Paul Volberding, associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and AIDS program director at San Francisco General Hospital. ``If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point, even if he hadn\\textbackslash{}'t developed full-blown AIDS,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Nicholson, the CDC\\textbackslash{}'s clinical immunology chief, presented her findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing <b> blood </b> cells from 15 homosexual Atlanta men who were infected by the <b> virus </b> and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didn\\textbackslash{}'t suffer AIDS. Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, Nicholson said. She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected peripheral <b> blood </b> mononuclear cells \\_ a class of white <b> blood </b> cells. If a simple test could show that someone infected with the <b> virus </b> soon will get AIDS, <b> doctors </b> could better decide when to prescribe AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections that kill AIDS <b> patients </b> once the <b> virus </b> has crippled their <b> immune </b> systems, Volberding said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is believed to slow progression of AIDS. From a scientific standpoint, ``learning what a person\\textbackslash{}'s risk of developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. But Nicholson and Volberding acknowledged that some AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will develop <b> disease </b> symptoms. Nicholson said <b> researchers </b> previously knew that people infected with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting white <b> blood </b> cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection progresses. Her <b> study </b> found that the number of helper cells decreases more quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in infected <b> patients </b> who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will develop disease,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said, adding that her findings point the way toward determining which <b> patients </b> are likely to do so. AIDS, or acquired <b> immune </b> deficiency syndrome is caused by a <b> virus </b> that damages the body\\textbackslash{}'s <b> immune </b> system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. The CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991. </p> 0.654384948653109  \\textbackslash{}n   The Red Cross acknowledged Saturday it erred in distributing 24 pints of <b> blood </b> that had failed AIDS procedures but said none of the <b> blood </b> was used and none carried the deadly virus. The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the questionable one-pint units were shipped last month to hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers in Washington and Nashville, Tenn., but were never used on any patients. The FDA did not identify the facilities that received the blood. ``While it should not have been shipped, it actually proved to be HIV (AIDS virus) free, and a number of units underwent processing that would inactivate the virus,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Gene Jeffers, American Red Cross spokesman. He said there was ``no known <b> health </b> hazard associated with the 24 units of blood. We were very fortunate and lucked out in that there was no human risk at all involved here.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Jeffers acknowledged, however, that five of the units tested positive for hepatitis B antigens and could have posed a <b> health </b> risk had they been used in transfusions. However, they were not used, he said. Initial tests showed 10 of the questionable units contained HIV antibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those units underwent a process that breaks down the <b> blood </b> into components for specific uses and eliminates the virus, Jeffers said. The remaining nine units, he said, were from donors who were unacceptable because they previously tested ``false positive\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for AIDS, but all the actual units were tested as safe, he said. Federal officials estimate that the chances of getting AIDS, or acquired <b> immune </b> deficiency syndrome, from a transfusion are one in 40,000. The chief victims have been homosexual men or intravenous <b> drug </b> users. No one is known to have recovered from the <b> disease </b> that attacks the body\\textbackslash{}'s <b> immune </b> system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The Nashville Banner reported Saturday that two additional pints from disqualified donors were actually used in transfusions, but no patient was harmed. The newspaper gave no details of the transfusions but said follow-up tests of the <b> blood </b> donors showed they did not carry the AIDS virus. Jeffers said he knew of no actual transfusion of <b> blood </b> that should have been rejected. The FDA report said none of the questionable <b> blood </b> was used on patients. As a result of the errors, the FDA said it has increased its periodic audits of the <b> blood </b> supply and instituted new training procedures for <b> blood </b> bank employees. The mistake in Washington was discovered in a routine audit. The Tennessee errors came to light in an FDA investigation that followed a lawsuit against local <b> blood </b> bank officials by a woman who said she became infected with AIDS through a <b> blood </b> transfusion. Two senior officials of the Washington regional office of the American Red Cross \\_ John McGraw and Frederick Darr \\_ have been suspended with pay for 30 days pending an investigation of their actions, said Richard Schubert, president of the American Red Cross. Schubert said no officials in the Nashville <b> center </b> had been disciplined, but that the investigation there was continuing. Six of the questionable units of <b> blood </b> were from the Washington <b> center </b> and the other 18 were from Nashville, the FDA said. </p> 0.644204546928449  \\textbackslash{}n   The Centers for Disease Control disputes a <b> study </b> by the Hudson Institute that the number of Americans infected with the deadly AIDS <b> virus </b> is actually twice the official estimate. In a <b> study </b> released Friday, the Hudson Institute said that up to 3 million Americans are infected by the AIDS virus, an estimate that is far above the calculation by CDC, the primary federal agency monitoring the spread of AIDS. Kevin R. Hopkins, a Hudson mathematician, said his <b> study </b> uses ``realistic\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' assumptions not used by the CDC and, as a result, his estimate is closer to the true number of Americans infected by the human immunodeficiency <b> virus </b> which causes AIDS. ``The actual number of people carrying the HIV <b> virus </b> in the United States (at the end of 1987) was not the 900,000 to 1.4 million the official sources estimate, but probably more than twice that number,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the Hudson report said. ``There were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the AIDS virus, with the most likely total of infections probably close to 2.4 million,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the report said. Dr. Timothy Dondero, chief of a CDC branch studying the spread of AIDS, quickly disputed the claim, however. In a telephone interview from the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Dondero said he and his staff reviewed the Hudson <b> study </b> and the methods used and said, ``We do not feel a change in our data is appropriate.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said that for the Hudson model to be correct, about 2 percent of the young adult population in the United States would have to be infected with HIV. Yet, he said, ``their figures are inconsistently high within segments of populations for which there are test results.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dondero said tests from hospital patients, military recruits and prisoners show HIV infection rates of less than 1 percent \\_ 0.2 percent to 0.66 percent \\_ among young adults. Hopkins admitted, ``We\\textbackslash{}'re all in a guessing game\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' when it comes to estimating the number of people infected with the AIDS virus. Nonetheless, he said he believed the Hudson method is a more realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation. ``The CDC may be right and we may be wrong,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Hopkins said. ``Until a national seroprevalence test is conducted, we will not know. ... The main conclusion is that we cannot be complacent about this disease.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The <b> study </b> by Hudson, a privately financed public policy <b> research </b> organization with headquarters in Indianapolis, used basic CDC data on the number of AIDS cases. But Hopkins said Hudson used different computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques to estimate the rate of HIV infections. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is caused by the HIV virus, is the end stage of the <b> disease </b> and may not develop for years after a person is infected with the virus. But an infected person can spread the <b> virus </b> before developing AIDS. For this reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic. HIV infection is determined by a <b> blood </b> test which identifies antibodies in <b> blood </b> serum. A person with such antibodies is known as seropositive. Hopkins said the Hudson <b> study </b> also estimated that the number of heterosexuals infected by the <b> virus </b> may be three times higher than CDC estimates. The CDC says the chief victims of AIDS, a contagious <b> disease </b> that attacks the body\\textbackslash{}'s <b> immune </b> system, have been homosexual men and intravenous <b> drug </b> users. The Hudson <b> study </b> estimates that of the 850,000 to 1.4 million heterosexuals infected with the HIV virus, between 200,000 and 500,000 are those who do not use drugs. ``There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Hopkins. ``A breakout into the non-monogamous population is unavoidable.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The CDC has estimated that the AIDS <b> virus </b> has infected only 80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population. The Hudson report said about 118,000 of the heterosexuals infected are ``mainstream\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' population members. ``They are not poor, and they are not IV <b> drug </b> users,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Hudson said. ``But they are nonetheless carriers of the <b> virus </b> and, through their sexual contacts, can proceed to spread the <b> disease </b> to others of their same class.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The CDC says that as of Aug. 15, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,702 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,898, have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. </p> 0.621781836027599  \\textbackslash{}n   Mice prone to developing a <b> blood </b> cell <b> cancer </b> gained partial protection from a human gene that influences <b> blood </b> cell development, suggesting that developmental genes may affect vulnerability to cancer, <b> researchers </b> say. Such genes may make a difference in how long normal cells remain susceptible to turning malignant, they said. The work is reported in Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s issue of the British journal Nature by Philip Leder, Michel Nussenzweig and Emmett Schmidt of Harvard Medical School with colleagues there and at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. They worked with mice that carried a human c-myc gene, which puts them at high risk for developing a <b> blood </b> cell <b> cancer </b> called pre-B cell lymphoma. Pre-B cells are those that will develop as B cells, an important part of the body\\textbackslash{}'s disease-fighting <b> immune </b> system. Those mice were bred with others that carried a different human gene, one that makes B cells skip an early stage in their development. Some progeny from these matings inherited both human genes, and their lymphoma rates were compared to those that carried only the cancer-causing gene. Results showed that the gene that speeds development caused both a delay and a reduction in the tumors, <b> researchers </b> said. By 117 days of age, half the mice that carried only the cancer-causing gene had developed lymphoma, but none of the mice with both genes had developed it. After a year, more than 90 percent of the first group had developed tumors, compared to only 40 percent of the mice with both human genes. The developmental gene apparently hampered development of <b> cancer </b> by speeding up the maturation of pre-B cells, leaving fewer at stages most susceptible to the cancer-causing gene, <b> researchers </b> suggested. In general, a diverse group of genes that produce either an acceleration or pause in cell development may influence the rates and time of onset for cancer, <b> researchers </b> said. </p> 0.615171713382808  \\textbackslash{}n   A panel of experts says removing a cancerous tumor in the early stages of breast <b> cancer </b> gives as good a survival chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast is removed. Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give ``excellent\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the panel said. The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the National Institutes of Health to consider <b> research </b> on the survival of women with early stages of breast <b> cancer </b> and to develop a consensus on what therapy should be used to treat the disease. ``The therapies appear to be equivalent in survival,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Dr. William C. Wood, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and chairman of the committee. ``We believe it is preferable to preserve an organ.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early stage breast cancer, Wood said. A lumpectomy is followed with radiation therapy, and Wood said some <b> patients </b> choose mastectomy because they ``prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of radiation therapy.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In its report, the committee said surgery in which the breast is saved, or conserved, ``is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer, and is preferable\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' because the breast is preserved and the survival chances are the same as for mastectomy. Wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the removal of nearby lymph nodes. If these nodes are cancer-free and the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter, both methods of <b> treatment </b> have about a 90 percent chance of cure. About 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast <b> cancer </b> this year, the committee report said. Between 75 percent and 80 percent of this group will have Stage I or Stage II disease, and about two-thirds of these will have cancer-free lymph nodes. Stage I and II cancers have not spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes. But just how to treat this early-stage breast <b> cancer </b> long has been controversial. Traditionally, the preferred <b> treatment </b> has been a radical mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is removed. During the past two decades, there have been a number of studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast surgery, including lumpectomy. The committee found that, based on the studies, survival rates are virtually the same for the two types of therapy. The experts said the picture was less clear for follow-up <b> treatment </b> using chemotherapy or a <b> drug </b> that blocks the hormone estrogen. The studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy, but the committee said the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patient\\textbackslash{}'s quality of life. For <b> patients </b> with very small primary tumors \\_ one centimeter or less \\_ adjuvant therapy is not required, the committee said. The committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full understanding by the patient of all the options. Lumpectomies are not appropriate for all Stage I or II <b> patients </b> because of the size of the breast, or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps within the breast, the committee said. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  black city mayor white barry community blacks council memorial city\\textbackslash{}'s moore racial jackson whites koch rights robinson civil members rev </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.374482495957865  \\textbackslash{}n   Marion Barry\\textbackslash{}'s lawyer is portraying Rasheeda Moore as a vengeful ex-lover who trapped the <b> mayor </b> in an FBI sting operation because he had abandoned her for another woman. Moore, a former model, denied the suggestion Friday at the mayor\\textbackslash{}'s cocaine and perjury trial, insisting, ``I was not out to get Mr. Barry.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But she acknowledged that she had repeatedly steered the conversation around to drugs during the secretly videotaped encounter with Barry in a Washington hotel room last Jan. 18. She conceded that Barry was primarily interested that evening in having sex with her. In her second day of cross-examination by Barry\\textbackslash{}'s chief lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, Moore also acknowledged that she broke the FBI\\textbackslash{}'s instructions and tried to persuade the <b> mayor </b> to use drugs. Midway through the FBI videotape in which Barry ultimately smoked crack cocaine, Moore asked the <b> mayor </b> if he wants to use drugs. ``No, not tonight,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Barry replied in the tape, which was played in court Thursday. ``You felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade, influence, coerce or beguile\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Barry into using drugs, Mundy asked Moore. ``I did,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she replied. ``Why did you do that?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the lawyer asked. ``Just in the gist of the evening,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Moore, who said she got ``overcarried\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in performing her duties for the FBI. ``In your zeal to get Mr. Barry,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mundy said accusingly. ``For all you knew, he had been off drugs since May\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' 1989 when Moore moved to California. ``Not in my zeal,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the witness insisted. ``I was not out to get Mr. Barry.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``What was your intent?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mundy asked Moore. ``Working this operation\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' with the FBI, she replied. The defense lawyer suggested that Moore had been badly treated by the <b> mayor </b> and motivated by revenge. ``Were you mad at Mr. Barry because he didn\\textbackslash{}'t return your calls\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' throughout an eight-month span in 1989, Mundy asked. ``No, I wasn\\textbackslash{}'t,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Moore replied. She also denied that she was angry because the married <b> mayor </b> was involved with another woman, Maria McCarthy, or because he had slapped her when they broke up their romantic relationship. Had Moore been scorned? a reporter asked Mundy after the day\\textbackslash{}'s court session. ``A woman scorned,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mundy agreed immediately. ``Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' McCarthy was jailed for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury looking into the mayor\\textbackslash{}'s alleged drug use. She later relented and is now listed as a possible witness at Barry\\textbackslash{}'s trial. Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. One of the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation. Meanwhile Friday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, presiding in the Barry case, barred <b> black </b> activist clergyman George Augustus Stallings, a Barry supporter, from attending the trial. Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest, broke with the Vatican by starting his own African-American church. Mundy and the American Civil Liberties Union said they were asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s decision regarding Stallings as well as his order Thursday barring Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Jackson said Stallings\\textbackslash{}' and Farrakhan\\textbackslash{}'s presence in the courtroom would be potentially disruptive. Barry told reporters he could ``not understand why any citizen\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' who wanted to use one of the four courtroom passes provided to the defense cannot do so. ``So I think that we are in a totalitarian situation where Bishop Stallings or Minister Farrakhan (cannot attend.),\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Barry said. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s like in Nazi Germany.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.364913244447588  \\textbackslash{}n   Beneath a naked bluff on a mile-long Boston Harbor island known chiefly for its antiquated jail lie the unmarked graves of about 4,100 early immigrants whose American dreams ended in death. Most were famine-weakened Irish who fled their starving country in the mid-1800s only to be deemed ``undesirable\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and detained on Deer Island, where they died and until now were largely forgotten. ``They symbolize all immigrants that have come to Boston and to America,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mayor Raymond Flynn said this week. ``They may have been poor, probably didn\\textbackslash{}'t have any family and weren\\textbackslash{}'t among the elite. ``But still every respect should be afforded to their memory.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Residents of Boston, home to more Irish-Americans per capita than any other U.S. city, are resurrecting the <b> city\\textbackslash{}'s </b> missing chapter. Deer Island\\textbackslash{}'s low-security jail is scheduled to close in 1991 and local business, labor and other groups plan to have the gravesite landscaped by 1995, the 150th anniversary year of the potato famine.

The graves on the island about four miles from Boston\\textbackslash{}'s wharves came to Flynn\\textbackslash{}'s attention several months ago, after construction workers turned up bones at a new sewage treatment plant site. ``You think of them getting this far, coming across the Atlantic and being able to look over and see the <b> city </b> ... only to end up in an anonymous pauper\\textbackslash{}'s grave,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Francis J. Costello, the mayor\\textbackslash{}'s adviser on Irish-American Affairs. ``We have to put a proper finish on this.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Many of the thousands of immigrants held on Deer Island eventually made it to a new life on the mainland. But thousands more were buried in shallow, lime-lined trenches that held eight or 10 bodies each. Their anonymous graves tell the story of immigrants who saw but never reached America\\textbackslash{}'s shores. Ireland\\textbackslash{}'s population of 8 million was cut in half by fatal disease, starvation and emigration after a devastating plant disease hit the country\\textbackslash{}'s staple potato crop in 1845. During the next 10 years, more than 152,000 Irish fled to Boston, many of them tenant farmers forced to move on when they no longer could afford to pay rent. The Yankees were unprepared for the influx of penniless, weak and diseased immigrants, many of whom were near death after a month or more aboard the crowded ``coffin ships\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' they had taken across the Atlantic. ``As a precautionary measure to ward off a pestilence that would have been ruinous to the public health and business of the city,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' a quarantine hospital was established on Deer Island, according to a Massachusetts Senate document dated 1848.

Robinson is white. ``I think the Barry trial is just another indication that people are very, very sensitive to race and how people are treated,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Ethelbert Miller, a poet who teaches at Howard University. Miller is black. A U.S. District Court jury began deliberating the Barry case Thursday afternoon. Two members, both men, are white. One of them has been chosen jury foreman. Barry admits that the trial has brought to the surface ``a simmering amount of polarization and racism that was already there.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Some <b> blacks </b> agree with Barry\\textbackslash{}'s claim that he was the target of overzealous <b> white </b> prosecutors. Others feel betrayed by the mayor, who had claimed repeatedly that he didn\\textbackslash{}'t use drugs. ``The majority of <b> whites </b> are just plain annoyed and angry and just want this guy to go,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' D.C. Councilman Jim Nathanson said before the trial began. Nathanson, who is white, represents a predominantly <b> white </b> district. For all the talk about <b> racial </b> polarization, Barry is the one who was often credited with cooling the tempers that erupted after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Ten people died, 1,191 were reported injured and 7,650 were arrested in the <b> city\\textbackslash{}'s </b> worst riots. Washington was then 63 percent black. Some <b> black </b> leaders, Jesse L. Jackson among them, have suggested that the climate exists for a resurgence of <b> racial </b> violence in Washington if Barry is convicted. Barry himself said it will not. ``Those who would even talk about that don\\textbackslash{}'t represent me, don\\textbackslash{}'t represent what I stand for,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he told reporters last week. ``You obviously don\\textbackslash{}'t realize that we have grown as a people the last 20 years. We will not destroy that which we have worked so hard to build up.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``To equate this to the violence that would occur when a <b> white </b> man killed Martin Luther King is asinine,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Robinson said. ``People will talk about it in bars and on the street, but I just don\\textbackslash{}'t believe that it is going to happen.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Some of the noise that you hear is sort of par for the course,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Sam Smith, the <b> white </b> publisher of the Progressive Review, a Washington opinion journal. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s just that more people are paying attention to it now.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The presiding judge in the trial, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is white. One of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin, is white. The other, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts, is black. Barry\\textbackslash{}'s lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, is black. Barry has called the case ``a political lynching\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and a case of ``satanic, dirt-like tactics.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Jackson called it part of an ``ugly pattern\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of ``white judicial leadership attacking <b> black </b> political leadership.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks voiced a similar complaint. U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said he believes in trying cases ``regardless of who the person is or what the political priorities are.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The <b> mayor </b> and his allies have also sharply criticized news media coverage of the case. Abdul Alim Muhammad, a Muslim who is running for Congress in suburban Prince George\\textbackslash{}'s County, Md., said, ``What we are witnessing in D.C. is like an electronic lynching. In some respects, the media are no better than the red-necked tobacco chewing <b> members </b> of the Ku Klux Klan.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, has shown his support for Barry by attending the trial despite efforts by the judge to have him barred as ``potentially disruptive.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Barry, who broke into politics as a street organizer in the <b> civil </b> <b> rights </b> movement, has been <b> mayor </b> for 12 years. He is not seeking re-election, and six candidates are running to succeed him. When one of them, City Council Chairman David Clarke, was introduced at a rally for <b> black </b> South African leader Nelson Mandela, he was booed by <b> members </b> of the mostly <b> black </b> audience. Clarke is white. Although he still has a loyal following, especially among poor blacks, Barry is increasingly viewed as an embarrassment by <b> members </b> of Washington\\textbackslash{}'s large <b> black </b> middle class. Long-time <b> civil </b> <b> rights </b> advocate and educator Roger Wilkins, a past political supporter of the mayor, wrote recently in The Washington Post: ``Marion Barry used the elders and lied to the young. He has manipulated thousands of others with his cynical use of charges of racism to defend his malodorous personal failures.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Robert Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, said Barry ``has certainly created a <b> racial </b> situation out of something that I do not think was. He is exploiting tensions and in some cases creating tensions that otherwise would not have existed.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Woodson, who is black, was a member of a White House <b> council </b> on private sector initiatives in the Reagan administration. The Rev. James Bevel, a Barry supporter who conducted prayer meetings in a tent outside the courthouse through much of the trial, said; ``It is not affecting basic race relationships or hostilities in <b> black </b> folks toward <b> white </b> people. I don\\textbackslash{}'t see that in the people I\\textbackslash{}'m around.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Rev. A. Knighton Stanley, the <b> black </b> pastor of People\\textbackslash{}'s Congregational Church, said he avoids raising the issue of possible violence. ``Am I uneasy?

Koch said he stands by his criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson before New York\\textbackslash{}'s Democratic primary, but says he regrets that his belligerent style and sharply worded attacks offended Jackson\\textbackslash{}'s supporters. In a statement released hours after Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called on the <b> mayor </b> to apologize for his ``divisive\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' remarks, Koch said he had ``articulated my concerns in a way that, regrettably, offended a large number of people, both <b> black </b> and white.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``I would hope they will look beyond my style to the substance of what I said, which I believe was fair political criticism. ``The words I used were too sharp. These are words I have used for years. Because of the particular sensitivity of this situation, I should have been more careful in my choice of words.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' It was highly unusual for Ward \\_ the <b> city\\textbackslash{}'s </b> first <b> black </b> police commissioner and a Koch appointee \\_ to comment on political matters that did not directly involve the police department, but he said he felt the need to do so because he was being asked regularly about Koch\\textbackslash{}'s anti-Jackson efforts. In a letter that appeared in today\\textbackslash{}'s editions of The New York Times, Koch said, ``It was never my intent to draw political lines with <b> racial </b> or religious borders.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ward said today he was ``absolutely\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' satisfied that the <b> mayor </b> never intended to insult the <b> black </b> community. Koch\\textbackslash{}'s attacks on Jackson have brought a continued backlash and have prompted early efforts to form a coalition to defeat the <b> mayor </b> next year, when it is expected he will seek a fourth term. When asked if Koch was apologizing to Jackson as well as his supporters, the mayor\\textbackslash{}'s press secretary, George Arzt, responded: ``Whatever the letter says.

England was a second home to Henson, who died in May at the age of 53. ``He loved England and the English; we claim him as ours,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Duncan Kenworthy, chief of Henson Productions in Britain. For the tribute, the cathedral was transformed to resemble a north London parkland Henson loved. The 17th-century building was festooned with greenery, its aisles full of Henson\\textbackslash{}'s creatures and portraits of their creator. Friends and colleagues of Henson had worked into the night adorning the cathedral with garlands, plants and birches. A May 21 <b> memorial </b> for Henson at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York included a Dixieland band and Muppets singing their way through the crowd. Henson died May 16 in New York of pneumonia. Henson\\textbackslash{}'s family asked well-wishers not to wear black, saying the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for Henson\\textbackslash{}'s life as a traditional <b> memorial </b> service. ``He has left a heritage that will never be forgotten. Jim Henson will always be with us,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Lord Lew Grade. It was Grade who contracted Henson in 1976 to make 24 half-hour episodes of ``The Muppet Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' after the Muppeteer failed to find American backing for the variety show. The show became one of the most widely seen television programs in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100 countries. Most of Henson\\textbackslash{}'s films were made in Britain as well. Henson owned a home in north London\\textbackslash{}'s leafy Hampstead district, across the street from the onetime Victorian post office housing the Creature Shop where his puppets are made.

Last May 11, <b> independent </b> counsel James McKay launched his inquiry of Meese\\textbackslash{}'s assistance to Wedtech and the probe has spread to the <b> attorney </b> general\\textbackslash{}'s involvement with the pipeline. In both instances, McKay\\textbackslash{}'s investigators have been examining stock trades made on Meese\\textbackslash{}'s behalf by his investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn. Chinn and Meese were brought together by Meese\\textbackslash{}'s longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, a central figure in both the Wedtech scandal and the <b> pipeline </b> project. It was disclosed earlier this month that: \\_In connection with the \\$1 billion proposed pipeline, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport paid \\$150,000 to his <b> attorney </b> Wallach, who directed the funds to an account owned by Chinn. Rappaport was a partner in the project with San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc., which was going to build the pipeline. Rappaport was brought into the deal in 1985 primarily because of his close ties to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. \\_The money from the Meese Partners account, Wallach\\textbackslash{}'s \\$150,000 placed in the Chinn account and several hundred thousand dollars from Chinn\\textbackslash{}'s biggest customer, Marymount College of Palos Verdes, Calif., were used as capital by Chinn to buy hard-to-get, brand-new stock issues, which Chinn sold later the same day. It would have been difficult for Chinn to obtain such stock with Meese\\textbackslash{}'s money alone. ``Without using the holdings of the other accounts he controlled, ... Mr. Chinn may not have been able to conduct the number of trades he did ... on behalf of Meese Partners,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' a congressional subcommittee said in a report this month. \\_Once the stock was sold and the profit and loss determined, Chinn assigned profits and losses to his various customers. Overall, Meese invested \\$50,000 and came away 18 months later with \\$95,000, almost all of it gained through a total of 23 one-day stock trades. Eighteen of the trades were profitable. In seven of the trades, the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> didn\\textbackslash{}'t have enough money in his account to generate the profits and losses that were assigned him. Chinn\\textbackslash{}'s biggest customer, Marymount College, didn\\textbackslash{}'t fare nearly as well as Meese. Was the stock trading actually a well-disguised payoff to Meese? That question is one that McKay\\textbackslash{}'s office has been unable to resolve, say the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Central to the <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> is whether there was a plan to steer the proceeds of Chinn\\textbackslash{}'s stock transactions to Meese and whether the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> knew about it. The <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> says he knew nothing about the transactions because he had set up a limited blind partnership with Chinn\\textbackslash{}'s company under which details were to be kept secret from Meese as a way to protect the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> from violating rules against conflict of interest. The investigators face a wall of silence from the others involved in setting up the financial arrangements, Chinn and Wallach, who are both under indictment for racketeering in the Wedtech scandal. Wallach denied to McKay\\textbackslash{}'s investigators that he gave anything of value to Meese, but Wallach refused to tell McKay anything about his dealings with Wedtech, his knowledge of the Meese-Chinn partnership and his dealings with Chinn. McKay said that after the Wedtech trial expected later this year of Wallach, Chinn and business associate R. Kent London, the <b> independent </b> counsel may seek their testimony again. The <b> attorney </b> general\\textbackslash{}'s good fortune in stock trading began months after he smoothed the way for Wallach to discuss the <b> pipeline </b> with then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who met with Wallach and Rappaport in June 1985. Later in the year, Meese and Wallach met with Peres about the pipeline, which was never built. Also during the period the stock trading was taking place, Chinn sat on the <b> board </b> of directors of Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor that allegedly paid out millions of dollars to lawyers and lobbyists in an attempt to influence various public officials, including Meese, in the awarding of federal contracts. One of those lawyers was Wallach, who was paid \\$1.3 million from 1981 through 1986 by Wedtech. The stock trades that made profits for the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> took place some four years after Meese, then White House counselor, arranged for his deputy, James Jenkins, to intervene on behalf of Wedtech in connection with a \\$32 million no-bid contract to build small engines for the Army. Despite the misgivings of Army officials over what they regarded as a high price, Wedtech was awarded the contract following a White House meeting called by Jenkins. Meese ended the financial arrangement with Chinn last year after the investment adviser came under <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> in the Wedtech scandal and after public disclosure that Chinn had sat on Wedtech\\textbackslash{}'s <b> board </b> of directors. </p> 0.444618248789634  \\textbackslash{}n   Attorney General Edwin Meese\\textbackslash{}'s wife, Ursula, will undergo questioning shortly in the <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> of her husband about her own \\$40,000-a-year job, say <b> sources </b> familiar with the case. The office of <b> independent </b> counsel James McKay is trying to determine whether longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach in effect helped supplement the Meeses\\textbackslash{}' income by recommending Mrs. Meese for jobs, said <b> sources </b> familiar with the probe, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mrs. Meese has retained the same Washington law firm representing her husband, said James Rocap, one of Meese\\textbackslash{}'s lawyers. She will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be questioned by investigators from McKay\\textbackslash{}'s office. McKay said last week that his <b> investigation </b> of Meese, also encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Meese\\textbackslash{}'s job, would continue at least until the end of April. McKay last month subpoenaed records relating to Mrs. Meese\\textbackslash{}'s post with the Washington chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, said a lawyer for the chapter, James Bierbower. A lawyer for Wallach, George Walker, has told The Washington Post that Wallach had suggested Mrs. Meese for a job with a local radio station owned by the Bender family of Washington. Mrs. Meese took the position with the MS Society instead. However, Bierbower said the Bender Foundation of Washington, controlled by the same family that owns the radio station, is contributing the \\$40,000 a year that constitutes Mrs. Meese\\textbackslash{}'s salary with the MS group. Calls to the Bender Foundation seeking its reasons for paying Mrs. Meese\\textbackslash{}'s salary were not returned. Mrs. Meese has been a volunteer for the MS Society since 1981 and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called Operation Job Match, matching MS victims with employers. Mrs. Meese also was questioned in an earlier <b> independent </b> counsel\\textbackslash{}'s <b> investigation </b> of Meese in 1984. In that investigation, <b> independent </b> counsel Jacob Stein probed Meese\\textbackslash{}'s failure to include in his financial disclosure statements a \\$15,000 loan by Edwin Thomas to Mrs. Meese. Thomas later became Meese\\textbackslash{}'s assistant counselor at the White House. The <b> independent </b> counsel found no connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by Thomas, his wife and his son. In another development Monday, Justice Department <b> sources </b> said Meese will face an ethics <b> investigation </b> by his own department\\textbackslash{}'s Office of Professional Responsibility if McKay doesn\\textbackslash{}'t seek an indictment. Such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a recommendation to President Reagan that Meese be fired. Former Assistant Attorney General William Weld\\textbackslash{}'s files on the <b> attorney </b> general\\textbackslash{}'s dealings with Wallach were moved to OPR last Friday, the <b> sources </b> said. Material collected by Weld\\textbackslash{}'s <b> criminal </b> division last year led to McKay\\textbackslash{}'s <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> of Meese. McKay said Friday he has insufficient evidence to date to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his involvement with a \\$1 billion Iraqi oil <b> pipeline </b> touted by Wallach or his involvement with the regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he held \\$14,000 in Baby Bell stock. In December, McKay said he didn\\textbackslash{}'t have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. McKay said that if he decides not to seek a <b> criminal </b> indictment of Meese, the <b> independent </b> counsel\\textbackslash{}'s office ``will refer all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate administrative authorities,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' a reference to OPR. OPR\\textbackslash{}'s chief, Michael Shaheen, denied assertions by Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, that his office had begun examining Meese\\textbackslash{}'s ties to longtime friend Wallach last year. That review was halted when McKay launched his <b> criminal </b> <b> investigation </b> of Meese last May 11, the <b> sources </b> said. </p> 0.380476725806409  \\textbackslash{}n   A top aide to Attorney General Edwin Meese III says a recent congressional report accusing his boss of violating White House ethics rules should top a ``list of sleaze.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who last year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to Meese, said the bipartisan Senate report is harmful to ongoing inquiries into the <b> attorney </b> general\\textbackslash{}'s actions. ``We\\textbackslash{}'ve got a process that\\textbackslash{}'s in place, people who are investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Reynolds said on CBS-TV\\textbackslash{}'s ``Face the Nation\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' program. ``If that is the best case that one comes up with against this <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> for ethical conduct, I would have to say that this man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Reynolds, the top enforcer of the Reagan administration\\textbackslash{}'s civil rights policies, added: ``If I were making a list of sleaze, I\\textbackslash{}'d put that (the report) at the top.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The report, issued Wednesday by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management, concluded that Meese\\textbackslash{}'s violation of the rules resulted in ``improper favoritism\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. The report said E. Robert Wallach sent Meese, then counselor to President Reagan, 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing Wedtech\\textbackslash{}'s efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the Army and government officials\\textbackslash{}' opposition to those efforts. Meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of Wedtech, but says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair hearing. Wallach, a longtime friend of Meese, is now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal. He was paid \\$1.3 million by the Bronx, N.Y.-company, which subsequently won the no-bid, \\$32 million contract. ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House policy on contracts with procurement officials, which failure resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the report said. The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981 says that ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or business associate has a financial interest.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Reynolds said the report ``made reference to a policy or rule in the White House that wasn\\textbackslash{}'t in existence at the time the Wedtech thing was referred over to the <b> attorney </b> general.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Independent Counsel James McKay has been investigating Meese\\textbackslash{}'s ties to Wedtech, a \\$1 billion Iraqi <b> pipeline </b> project promoted by Wallach, and other matters. In addition, the Office of Government Ethics is conducting an inquiry into why Meese solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessman to pay more than \\$3,000 apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference. Reynolds maintained that despite the investigations, morale at the Justice Department remains good. ``Actually, it\\textbackslash{}'s very good,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``We have a lot of professionals. Everybody in the department is very professional. ``Most of the people in the department take the attitude that is much the same as George Bush\\textbackslash{}'s attitude. These are investigations that are ongoing. They\\textbackslash{}'ll play themselves out, the process ought to be allowed to work,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Reynolds said. ``So far,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he added, ``nobody has suggested that the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> has done anything that comes close to unlawful activity or activity that is going to result in an indictment of any kind.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.369864663869631  \\textbackslash{}n   Here is a chronology of major developments in the story involving Attorney General Edwin Meese\\textbackslash{}'s wife, Ursula, and the Bender real estate transaction. Aug. 8, 1984: Congress approves a Reagan administration plan to move some Justice Department workers from the Chester Arthur Building and to give up 37 percent of its space when the lease expires in March 1986. March 1, 1985: Howard Bender, a Washington real estate developer, heads a partnership which completes purchase of the Chester Arthur Building for \\$37.5 million, nearly twice the assessed value and three times its purchase price about five years earlier. June 6, 1985: The administration notifies Congress the Justice Department intends to stay in the Chester Arthur Building, instead of moving out some employees. June 1985: Officials of the Justice Department\\textbackslash{}'s Immigration and Naturalization Service, the major tenant in the building, forward complaints to the General Services Administration \\_ the government\\textbackslash{}'s housekeeper \\_ that the building\\textbackslash{}'s air system is causing illness among workers. Fall 1985: Officials at WWDC, a rock-and-roll radio station owned by the Bender family, offer Attorney General Edwin Meese\\textbackslash{}'s wife, Ursula, a position as a public affairs commentator. She declines the offer. Sept. 26, 1985: Assistant immigration commissioner James Kennedy formally requests an environmental inspection of the air system at Chester Arthur. October 1985: The Bender Foundation, a family-owned philanthropy, makes known that it is willing to donate money to pay Ursula Meese as a development director of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, where she has been a volunteer. Howard Bender\\textbackslash{}'s wife, Sondra, is president of the foundation and serves on the MS society board. Jan. 1, 1986: Mrs. Meese begins a \\$40,000-a-year job, under the Bender Foundation\\textbackslash{}'s three-year grant. July 2, 1986: Environmental inspectors report ``many offices in the Chester Arthur Building which exhibited high complaint rates and above-average sick leave occurences contained viable aero-allergens in concentrations which could easily produce these effects.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' May 14, 1987: The GSA signs a \\$50 million, 10-year lease for Justice Department workers to stay in the Chester Arthur Building after the Bender partnership promises to clean the air system. The rent jumps more than three-fold. May 27, 1987: The partnership headed by Howard Bender sells the Chester Arthur Building for \\$60.1 million cash \\_ a \\$22.7 million profit over two years \\_ to an Illinois-based partnership. </p> 0.366105433666985  \\textbackslash{}n   July 8 The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on the resignation of Attorney General Meese: The last crony is leaving. Months, even years after propriety demanded it, Ed Meese says he\\textbackslash{}'ll resign \\_ sometime. Whatever conservative legacy he left the Justice Department and the courts is overshadowed by his cheapening of the office of <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> and the chaos now paralyzing Justice. ... Meese has managed to slip through the net in four investigations, because the evidence against him always was circumstantial. It just happened that cronies who did favors for Meese soon ended up with lucrative government contracts, or federal jobs or other special favors. The best Meese\\textbackslash{}'s investigators could find was impropriety, not illegality. Yet the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> took the lack of charges as a ringing endorsement of his innocence. ... Meese is a deal-maker, a hustler. He never understood that the <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> can\\textbackslash{}'t use his office to create a personal pork barrel. ... Does Meese leave any legacy except sleaze? ... He tried to weaken the Miranda Rule and abortion rights before a Supreme Court that was prepared to do neither. He embarked on an anti-pornography crusade, an odd priority for someone whose mission also includes fighting organized crime. He botched the early stages of the Iran-Contra probe, perhaps deliberately. Yet, Meese has shown one thing. An <b> attorney </b> general\\textbackslash{}'s politics are not as important as his credibility, his honesty and his ability to lead. After three years with a laughingstock for a leader, Justice needs an <b> attorney </b> <b> general </b> of high personal reputation. But the department must wait for the next administration to provide one. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  british french france britain london paris mrs thatcher prime european minister union sweden margaret europe germany community britain\\textbackslash{}'s australia major </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.507765602073666  \\textbackslash{}n   Garri Kasparov of the Soviet Union moved into first place Sunday in the World Cup Chess Championship with a 10th round victory over Ulf Andersson of Sweden.

The decision by the 12 EC nations gives jobless nationals in the European Community the same rights as wage-earners. An elderly citizen who has dreamed of retiring in sunnier southern climates will be able to obtain a five-year, renewable residency permit in the EC country of his choice. The retiree must show only proof of health insurance and that he or she will not burden the adopted nation\\textbackslash{}'s social security system. And a student who can show proof of registration at a university or college in another EC nation as well as sufficient income will receive a one-year renewable residency permit. Those who are unemployed by choice and do not classify as being either elderly or a student will have to prove they have sufficient income not to need assistance from the social security system in their new country. The 12 EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. In 1992, the nations will drop trade barriers among themselves to create a unified Euromarket. In Brussels Wednesday the 18 nations of Western Europe\\textbackslash{}'s two trading blocs began talks to pave the way for the so-called European Economic Space. The move would bring the six nations of the European Free Trade Association \\_ Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland \\_ closer to the European Community. Frans Andriessen, an EC commissioner, said he hoped broad agreement would be reached near the end of this year and be fully implemented on Jan. 1, 1993, when the EC\\textbackslash{}'s single market comes into force. </p> 0.317949177023953  \\textbackslash{}n   Luxembourg takes over the European Community\\textbackslash{}'s presidency on Tuesday, with war looming in the Persian Gulf, world trade talks in disarray and Europe in full transformation. The Grand Duchy, a tiny speck on the map with only about 0.1 percent of the population in the 12-nation community, has a good track record in handling the rotating six-month EC presidencies. Jacques Santer, <b> prime </b> <b> minister </b> of the 378,400 Luxembourgers, is convinced the mouse will roar again when his country takes over the community\\textbackslash{}'s presidency from Italy as 1991 begins. ``During all of our presidencies we always came up with results,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Santer said in a recent interview. Five years ago, the Luxembourg presidency paved the way for the Single European Act, an updated constitution that pushes the trade bloc toward creating a truly unified market after 1992. This time around, new initiatives to create economic, monetary and political <b> union </b> by the turn of the century have been thrust into Santer\\textbackslash{}'s lap. The Christian Democrat plans to act as a mediator between the EC\\textbackslash{}'s powerhouses - Germany, France and Britain - to finalize the blueprint for European unity. ``Because we are so small, the others do not suspect us of having ulterior self-serving motives,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Shoehorned between Germany, France and Belgium, Luxembourg occupies a key crossroads on the continent, straddling Europe\\textbackslash{}'s main cultures - the Romanic and Germanic. It is also well-connected with both the rich north and poor south in the community. The Persian Gulf crisis might prove the first test of Luxembourg\\textbackslash{}'s mettle. The EC has said it would not hold talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz unless the United States first reaches agreement with Iraq on exchanging foreign ministers\\textbackslash{}' visits. If the EC agrees to talk with Iraq, that task would fall to Luxembourg\\textbackslash{}'s Foreign Minister Jacques Poos. During Luxembourg\\textbackslash{}'s six months, a lot of energy will be spent on two conferences - one on economic and monetary union, the other on political <b> union </b> -to pave the way for a more unified Europe. Disarray reigns on how fast monetary <b> union </b> should be achieved, Santer said. He said calls for an independent EC defense organization are not realistic and it remains ``essential that we keep a partnership with the United States\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' within NATO - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The partnership with Washington has been strained in global trade, where the EC has resisted U.S. proposals that it reduce price supports and subsidies for farmers. The agricultural dispute blocked an agreement in world trade talks held in Brussels, Belgium earlier this month. The talks are to resume in Geneva next month. Santer, stressing the progress that has been made in the other 14 sectors covered by the trade talks, said farming should not block an overall accord. He argued in favor of a final deal that, if need be, excludes agriculture. </p> 0.312941082165462  \\textbackslash{}n   Britain\\textbackslash{}'s beleaguered trade secretary, Nicholas Ridley, came home Friday night from a trade visit to Hungary and expectations were he will resign after his charge that West Germany wanted to take over a united Europe. His comments in a magazine interview, which he later retracted, provoked cross-party calls for his resignation and were denounced in Germany, France and other European countries. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused Friday to answer questions about Ridley\\textbackslash{}'s political future, reportedly leaving the first move up to him. But even rank-and-file members of her Conservative Party, who applaud his warning of German supremacy over a united Europe, said he will have to go. Sir Marcus Fox, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory lawmakers, told BBC Radio 4 that Ridley\\textbackslash{}'s position was now ``very bad.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons on Thursday that Ridley was not reflecting government policy, nor her own views, but she rejected demands for his dismissal. Ridley, 61, the outspoken and controversial son of Viscount Ridley, is considered Mrs. Thatcher\\textbackslash{}'s closest ideological ally in the Cabinet. Political commentators said his departure would be a blow to her. In the interview with the conservative weekly, the Spectator, Ridley said the West German government\\textbackslash{}'s support for European monetary <b> union </b> ``is all a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to be thwarted. ``This rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely intolerable.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ridley said he opposed yielding sovereignty to the 12-nation European Community, which he said was run by ``17 unelected reject politicians.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said: ``You might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Earlier Friday night, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made the government\\textbackslash{}'s first move to repair the damage to Anglo-European relations. Speaking at the Anglo-American conference center near Oxford, Hurd said: ``Our alliance, our partnership and our friendship with France and Germany lie at the heart of modern British foreign policy. ``Lingering memories from the past do not prevent us from strengthening, month by month, the practical proofs of that friendship. ``Irreversible also is the steadily increasing cooperation with the fellow members and institutions of the European Community of which the <b> prime </b> <b> minister </b> spoke after the Dublin (EEC) summit (last month). ``Nothing will now put these processes in doubt.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Liberal Democratic Party, said: ``The issue has now become not Mr. Ridley\\textbackslash{}'s folly but Mrs. Thatcher\\textbackslash{}'s judgment. By refusing to sack him, she is multiplying the insult of his outrageous views.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Gordon Brown, the opposition Labor Party\\textbackslash{}'s trade spokesman, said she was guilty of a ``dismal failure of leadership\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' for leaving the decision about Ridley\\textbackslash{}'s future in his hands. ``With this indecision following on top of the Ridley insults, her inaction today signifies an astonishing abdication of responsibility that will make Britain the subject of, at best, ridicule, and at worst, hostility throughout Europe,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  club animals species members animal endangered wild hunter metropolitan quayle habitat wildlife elephants golf natural skins thailand order membership club\\textbackslash{}'s </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.480141393583948  \\textbackslash{}n   The owner of two Indian <b> elephants </b> says he\\textbackslash{}'ll agree to sell the 3\\{-ton <b> animals </b> if their former owner, who apparently has been hiding the pachyderms for four years, will return them. Richard Drake, owner of a now-closed Tehachapi, Calif., <b> animal </b> farm, said Sunday he wants to get fair market value for the 27-year-old female elephants, appraised at \\$70,000 apiece. Drake said he has spent ``thousands and thousands of dollars\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' crisscrossing the country searching for Arlan Seidon, the man who fled with the elephants, Tory and Duchess. Seidon, who raised the elphants from infancy, contacted The Star Ledger of Newark several weeks ago from an undisclosed location and said he would return to face charges of third-degree theft if the <b> elephants </b> were not given to Drake. Seidon sold the <b> elephants </b> to the Drakes for \\$80,000 in 1981 but said he repossessed the <b> animals </b> for non-payment. The Drakes successfully fought the action and in May 1984 Superior Court Judge Peter Thomas awarded them \\$107,000 in damages. Seidon also charged that Drake, 50, and his son, Edward, 30, abused the animals. The Drakes deny that charge. Seidon, 58, fled with the <b> elephants </b> from a farm in Colts Neck Township while the <b> animals </b> were with a circus in New Jersey. He has been on the lam ever since. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s been at a standstill for four years,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Drake said from his sister\\textbackslash{}'s Far Hills home. ``We have to do something.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Drake said Sunday he had contacted Seidon\\textbackslash{}'s attorney, Isabelle Strauss of East Orange, and was awaiting an answer to his proposal. Ms. Strauss, an <b> animal </b> activist, was not in her office today for additional comment, a secretary said. She told The Star Ledger on Saturday that Seidon, who phones her periodically, would not allow the <b> elephants </b> to go to <b> animal </b> brokers who would sell them to other people. Ms. Strauss said a Vermont businessman is interested in the <b> animals </b> and that she is trying to work out a deal. Ms. Strauss has said she does not know where or how Seidon has been concealing the elephants. Seidon has said he left his farm at Fordland, Mo., and his career preparing <b> animals </b> for circus and television appearances to care for the elephants, which eat about 200 pounds off hay a day. He said he hasn\\textbackslash{}'t seen his four children or met his only grandson since he took off with the animals. </p> 0.443985526522564  \\textbackslash{}n   The discovery of two <b> species </b> of the daddy-longlegs insect family in Edgewood County Park may block a proposed 18-hole <b> golf </b> course. Both <b> species </b> are called the Edgewood Park harvestman, of Sitalcina minor. They live only in serpentine rock formations in the park\\textbackslash{}'s hills, and several conservationists want the habitate to be preserved. ``Constructing a <b> golf </b> course would wipe out the whole harvestmen populations,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Thomas F. Briggs, a science teacher at San Francisco Lowell High School. ``These are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he added. Briggs discovered one of the <b> species </b> in 1983 and the other in 1985. Both have eight legs, and bright orange-red bodies that measure about 1 millimeter. Unlike spiders, daddy-longlegs do not spin webs. Along with Darrell Ubick, an entomologist, Briggs has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the <b> species </b> discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected creature, which could halt any development of their only known habitat. San Mateo County purchased the 468-acre site in 1980 from the state and has been attempting to build a <b> golf </b> course there for several years. ``This little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a <b> golf </b> course,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Barbara Kootz of nearby San Carlos, a golfer and leader of pro-development interests in the area. </p> 0.437763169939778  \\textbackslash{}n   Endangered <b> species </b> pop up in the strangest places. Like flowerbeds. Plant-protection activists say some <b> species </b> of bulbs bought to decorate American and European gardens are being collected by the millions in the wild, threatening to wipe out those flowers in their home turf. ``The world would lose an irreplaceable treasure,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Marjorie Arundel of Warrenton, Va., an adviser to the Garden Club of America\\textbackslash{}'s horticulture committee. ``They\\textbackslash{}'re the ancestors of all of our spring bulbs today.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mrs. Arundel and other activists are urging American gardeners to buy only commercially propagated plants, which experts say make up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway. ``Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade, but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Faith Campbell, director of the plant conservation program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of America, the NRDC has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to avoid most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or snowdrops, which they say are collected in the <b> wild </b> in Turkey. Those three <b> species </b> are listed as <b> endangered </b> in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. But this treaty \\_ effective in fighting trade in some <b> endangered </b> <b> animal </b> skins, horns and tusks \\_ has had little effect on the flower trade, Ms. Campbell said. Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey\\textbackslash{}'s Mediterranean regions, forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions. The popular ``Angel\\textbackslash{}'s Tears\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' narcissus are being collected in the wild, but experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or somewhere else. Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from the <b> wild </b> in the United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and the Soviet Union appear to be the sources for still other rare flowers. Some <b> species </b> of these plants may be produced by growers in the United States or Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check the origins as carefully as they can. This may become easier, as a result of the decision last May by the Dutch Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to require exporters to use a ``Bulbs from Wild Sources\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' label to identify wild-collected plants. Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label their cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor <b> species </b> and in 1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths. Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower trade, the action by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major impact, Ms. Campbell said. It is not binding, though, on dealers in the United States or other countries. Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall\\textbackslash{}'s catalogs. So even if American gardeners <b> order </b> from Dutch dealers covered by the rules, they might not know they were buying wild-collected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail, labeled ``wild sources.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``We can just hope they won\\textbackslash{}'t <b> order </b> those again,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ms. Campbell said. ``It is a messy phasing-in.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in Turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting <b> wild </b> flowers to start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat, she said. Gardeners shouldn\\textbackslash{}'t think they\\textbackslash{}'re aiding nature by keeping alive a <b> species </b> that might be disappearing in its native habitat. ``We don\\textbackslash{}'t consider that a contribution to conservation in any way,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ms. Campbell said. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s not playing its role in the ecosystem in which it evolved.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.421592774982234  \\textbackslash{}n   Entomologists say they want <b> endangered </b> <b> species </b> protection for a recently rediscovered butterfly that experts believed had been extinct for more than 50 years. Paul Hammond, an Oregon State University entomologist and butterfly expert, said he rediscovered the butterflies by accident. ``In the spring of 1989 I hiked out onto a south-facing slope of a hill that had native prairie on it, and here was this very unusual kind of lupine plant with all these little blue butterflies swimming around on it. ``I knew immediately what it was,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. It was Fender\\textbackslash{}'s blue butterfly, a relic of the ice ages found only in Oregon\\textbackslash{}'s Willamette Valley. The butterfly was last seen near the small town of Wren, west of Corvallis, in 1937. Since that find last year, several pockets of the <b> species </b> have been found in western Oregon. A petition is being prepared to ask the U.S. Fish and Wildlife to declare the butterfly a threatened <b> species </b> under the federal Endangered Species Act. Hammond said the butterfly has a wingspan of only about 1 inch. The male is a ``brilliant, iridescent blue,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``They really stand out. The female is a drab brown.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The butterfly dates back more than 10,000 years, Hammond said. Surrounded by glaciers to the north and mountains to the south, east and west, the butterfly\\textbackslash{}'s <b> habitat </b> was limited to a small area of the Willamette Valley. </p> 0.376721114005934  \\textbackslash{}n   A zoo advocacy group is calling for an investigation into the cause of a half-dozen puncture wounds on the head and face of an elephant that injured a veterinarian who was trying to treat the wounds. ``What we\\textbackslash{}'re talking about here is abuse,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sandra Keller, spokeswoman for Citizens for a Better Zoo, said Sunday. ``We have been receiving complaints about the way these <b> elephants </b> are being mistreated for several months.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Veterinarian Gail Hedberg was treating an abscess on the head of a 3\\{-ton Asian elephant named Tinkerbelle when the <b> animal </b> attacked her Saturday, fracturing her pelvis. Zookeepers said Tinkerbelle did a ``handstand\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on the woman. Hedberg was listed in stable condition today at San Francisco General Hospital. Some officials defended practices at the San Francisco Zoo. ``We have to use elephant hooks and other methods that may appear abusive because we\\textbackslash{}'re not talking about puppy dogs and pussy cats here,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said zoo director Saul Kitchener. ``How do you get a 10,000-pound elephant\\textbackslash{}'s attention?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Elephant keeper Michele Radovsky said beating an elephant is no different from ``people taking rolled newspapers and hitting their dog.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But Paul Hunter, a keeper at the zoo for nine years, said the abscess on Tinkerbell\\textbackslash{}'s head was caused by someone hitting her too hard with a hooked instrument called an ankuf or elephant hook. ``The <b> elephants </b> get beaten up real bad, and I\\textbackslash{}'m getting tired of it,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Hunter. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  environmental plant waste nuclear pollution water epa energy chemical plants power industry environment garbage air area site creek company tank </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.504413804597327  \\textbackslash{}n   Researchers have discovered small quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from Savannah Harbor about 100 miles downstream from the Savannah River Plant. Cesium 137, a radioactive isotope, was found in material taken from the harbor and dumped on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River, which forms the border with Georgia. Tests found tiny amounts of the material, insufficient to create a health hazard, The Charleston News \\& Courier reported today. The tests were done for the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department by researchers at the University of Georgia. The wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants because of <b> water </b> quality problems believed to be caused by industrial discharges into the river, agency officials said. Cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of <b> nuclear </b> fission, and is generally associated with radioactive waste. It emits beta and gamma radiation, both of which can produce a variety of ill effects, depending on the dosage. Lou Gordell, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy\\textbackslash{}'s <b> environmental </b> division at the <b> nuclear </b> plant, said he had not been informed of the study results, but acknowledged Monday that the material probably originated at the Savannah <b> nuclear </b> plant. The complex near Aiken produces the radioactive materials plutonium and tritium for <b> nuclear </b> weapons. The government-owned <b> plant </b> has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed that a series of accidents at the <b> site </b> over the past 30 years went unreported to the public. Gordell said sediment tests in Savannah Harbor for a 1984 study showed traces of Cesium 137, and that recent monitoring upstream found similar traces both in the <b> water </b> and river sediment. Much of the material leaked from SRP apparatus in the 1950s, but some is the result of continued discharge into the river, Gordell said. The level of contamination is far below EPA\\textbackslash{}'s maximum allowable level for drinking water, he said. Savannah and Beaufort-Jasper counties pump <b> water </b> from the Savannah River for drinking water. Traces of tritium also are found in the river, but also are below the maximum allowable levels, Gordell said. Cesium 137, with a half-life of 30 years, persists in the <b> environment </b> longer than tritium, with a half-life of 12 years. A half-life is the time it takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate. The Savannah Harbor is periodically dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain its depth for the port of Savannah. </p> 0.435779215217155  \\textbackslash{}n   A Massachusetts <b> company </b> is making money out of <b> garbage </b> through new recycling methods for cities swimming in the refuse of a throwaway society. Public landfills are clogged with paper, glass, aluminum and plastic, and less than 10 percent of 160 million tons of <b> garbage </b> produced yearly in the United States is recycled, according to David Spencer, president and founder of wTe Corp. in Bedford. His <b> company </b> develops methods for processing <b> waste </b> to recover ferrous metal and other substances. The <b> company </b> also runs trash-to-energy <b> plants </b> under contract with cities, and joined with such companies as Dow Chemical Co. to develop plastics recycling technology. At a research station at the University of California at Berkeley, wTe hauls in barrels of trash to experiment with ways to separate components for recycling and <b> energy </b> conversion. Spencer, 44, believes recycling and recovery, which is the process of extracting certain components of trash, will become increasingly important as cities run out of land to bury refuse, long the cheapest and easiest disposal method. ``Everything we manufacture in this country finds its way into the <b> waste </b> stream. ... It all winds up on a trash truck,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Spencer said in a recent interview. ``To look at the increase in garbage, just look at the GNP.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Spencer acknowledged that recovery and recycling operations are costly for cash-strapped municipalities, which must weigh such expenses as housing for the elderly against recycling programs. It often may be less expensive in the short run to bury <b> garbage </b> in a landfill, but in the long run ``yesterday\\textbackslash{}'s landfill is today\\textbackslash{}'s superfund site,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Spencer, who has degrees in metallurgy and materials science, is a Philadelphia native who, after attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, founded Waste Energy Technology Corp. in 1981. The name was changed to wTe in 1987. Now a \\$20 million, privately held <b> company </b> with 220 employees, wTe\\textbackslash{}'s operations include a waste-to-energy <b> plant </b> and recycling facility in Akron, Ohio, waste-recovery projects in Dade County, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio, and, through a subsidiary, a polystyrene recycling project in Brooklyn, N.Y. In Bedford, the <b> company </b> runs the city\\textbackslash{}'s curbside recycling program. Columbus has wTe under contract to use a magnetic process to extract ferrous metal from the city\\textbackslash{}'s <b> waste </b> stream before <b> waste </b> is burned in the city\\textbackslash{}'s incinerator. That makes the burning process less abrasive and wearing on city equipment. It also reduces the toxic level in and the amount of ash left over, said Tim Barr, deputy director of Columbus public utilities. Ray Kapper, Akron director of public services, said wTe was brought in to run the city\\textbackslash{}'s waste-to-energy <b> plant </b> after problems with hazardous <b> waste </b> and an explosion in which three people died. Such <b> plants </b> burn <b> waste </b> to produce steam and other forms of energy. Under contract with Amoco Corp., wTe developed a process for the McDonald\\textbackslash{}'s Corp. chain to recycle polystyrene containers tossed away with half-eaten hamburgers and paper. The extracted material is turned into trays and other products for Rubbermaid Inc. Recycling methods can be environmentally benign. For example, discarded tires, long an urban eyesore, can be burned safely to create energy, Spencer says. The 300,000 to 500,000 tires discarded in Akron annually are shredded and fed into the waste-to-energy <b> plant </b> during winter, when people traditionally throw out less trash but <b> energy </b> needs are greater, he said. Spencer said his interest in recycling comes from a lifelong hatred of seeing anything go to waste. ``My mother used to get the squeak out of the pig, as they say,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. </p> 0.419788158052852  \\textbackslash{}n   Radioactive gas leaked from the Connecticut Yankee <b> nuclear </b> <b> plant </b> for 10 minutes Monday morning, but no one was injured and there was no danger to the public or employees, a spokeswoman said. The release of xenon-krypton occurred while technicians were taking a test sample, Northeast Utilities spokeswoman Barbara Luce. She said the accident did not affect operations at the plant. The spokeswoman said the release was measured as two-hundredths of a millirem, a unit used to measure radiation exposure. By comparison, she said, a diagnostic chest x-ray involves between 20 and 30 millirems of radiation. Luce also said that there are daily, planned releases of the gas of less than a millirem. The gas is produced during fission. The utility notifed state and government officials of the accident and were investigating, Luce said. </p> 0.395006873442712  \\textbackslash{}n   At least two companies hired by the Energy Department as independent investigators of <b> environmental </b> and safety conditions at <b> nuclear </b> weapons <b> plants </b> are on the payroll at facilities they investigated, government records show. Others participating in the audits had bid for Energy Department contracts at sites they investigated, although they were not yet working there. Still others, while not associated with the <b> plants </b> they audited, are the Energy Department\\textbackslash{}'s prime contractors at other <b> nuclear </b> bomb factories. Written department guidelines for carrying out the ``independent tiger team\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding organizational conflicts of interest. It defines such a conflict as a situation in which a contractor ``has past, present or currently planned interests that either directly or indirectly ... may relate to the work to be performed\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and which may bias its judgment. The tiger teams were assembled by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins last summer to give an independent view of the plants\\textbackslash{}' compliance with state and federal environmental, safety and health standards. The auditing work is meant to lay the groundwork for actions to correct unsafe and illegal practices at the plants. Virtually all 17 major weapons facilities have severe <b> environmental </b> problems; estimates of the cost of cleaning up production wastes are as high as \\$100 billion. Watkins publicly stressed the independence of the tiger teams but did not explain that many of the experts would be tied to the weapons business. The Energy Department, which owns the plants, declined to comment on whether the contractors\\textbackslash{}' connections to the weapons <b> industry </b> amount to a conflict of interest that undermines the independence of the investigations or taints the findings. Department spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said the department would prefer to use its own employees for this work, ``but we don\\textbackslash{}'t have the people to do it.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Each team is headed by a small number of department officials, but most of the scientific work is done by contract employees. Most have extensive backgrounds in <b> nuclear </b> <b> environmental </b> and safety matters. A review of department records as well as interviews with government and <b> industry </b> officials show that of the eight weapons <b> plant </b> investigations done last year, at least three involved companies that held other Energy Department contracts at the same sites or were bidding for contract work at those facilities. \\_The engineering and <b> environmental </b> consulting firm NUS Corp. of Gaithersburg, Md., was on the tiger team that investigated the Y-12 uranium processing <b> plant </b> at Oak Ridge, Tenn., last fall. According to department records, NUS at the same time was working for the Oak Ridge reservation on an <b> environmental </b> study of its <b> nuclear </b> and hazardous <b> waste </b> management. The Y-12 <b> plant </b> is one of several operations at the Oak Ridge reservation. NUS\\textbackslash{}'s Oak Ridge contract was awarded Nov. 8, 1988, and was valued at \\$1.4 million. The firm also holds contracts at weapons facilities in South Carolina and Idaho. NUS spokesman Don Couchman declined to discuss any aspect of the firm\\textbackslash{}'s work for the Energy Department. \\_Science Applications International Corp. of La Jolla, Calif., helped evaluate the Nevada Test Site, which conducts underground <b> nuclear </b> weapons tests. The <b> company </b> at the same time was working at the <b> site </b> under two Energy Department contracts with a combined value of \\$100 million. Most of its work is at a proposed high-level <b> nuclear </b> <b> waste </b> dump at the <b> site </b> that was not part of the tiger team audit. \\_ICF Kaiser Engineers, an engineering and construction <b> company </b> based in Oakland, Calif., participated in tiger team audits at the Nevada Test Site. ICF held no Energy Department contracts at the test <b> site </b> at the time of the investigation last November, but it was bidding for a \\$5 million job to help the facility\\textbackslash{}'s prime contractor, Reynolds Electrical \\& Engineering Co., Inc., develop and carry out an <b> environmental </b> cleanup program there. ICF Kaiser announced it won the contract 10 days after the on-site tiger team work ended Dec. 1. Similarly, records show the <b> company </b> participated in tiger team investigations at the Fernald uranium processing <b> plant </b> in Ohio and the Y-12 Oak Ridge <b> plant </b> while it was a bidder for major Energy Department contracts at both sites. The contract at Oak Ridge is valued at \\$505 million over five years, according to Bob Lynch, deputy director of the department\\textbackslash{}'s field office there. Marc Tipermas, executive vice president of ICF, said in a telephone interview that he saw no conflict of interest in his company\\textbackslash{}'s involvement in the tiger team work. He said he was not sure whether, in choosing ICF for the work, the department knew or cared about the company\\textbackslash{}'s other work at the weapons plants. ``In order to get this job done well and quickly, contractors had to be used,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Tipermas said. ``Like many other companies, we were drafted. We were helter-skelter pulled onto these teams.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Energy Department has used private contractors to run the <b> nuclear </b> weapons <b> plants </b> since they were built as part of the World War II Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. The contracting system has left the department with little internal expertise in this <b> area </b> and a tendency to rely on the weapons makers to police themselves. Watkins strongly advocates hiring more federal employees with environmental, safety and health expertise to lessen the dependence on private contractors. Although the department insists that the tiger team members\\textbackslash{}' links to the weapons <b> industry </b> do not compromise their objectivity as judges of <b> environmental </b> and safety conditions at the plants, some outside experts disagree. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s inevitably a potential conflict when a contractor is reviewing another contractor, and the reason is that any possible criticism of one contractor might lead to future business for another contractor,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Donald F. Kettl, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University and author of a book on government use of contractors. Other tiger team members included companies in charge of running <b> nuclear </b> weapons plants, though not the ones they investigated. These include EG\\&G Inc., which is the prime contractor at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing <b> plant </b> near Denver, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory at Idaho Falls, which processes naval <b> nuclear </b> fuels, and the Mound Laboratory near Dayton, Ohio, which makes detonators for <b> nuclear </b> arms. Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs the Oak Ridge facilities, participated in some other audits, as did subsidiaries of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which runs several weapons sites, and Mason and Hangar Silas Mason Co., operator of the Pantex final weapons assembly <b> plant </b> near Amarillo, Texas. </p> 0.386319810983077  \\textbackslash{}n   Initial tests by a Washington apple grower have identified an organic <b> chemical </b> that may serve as a substitute for Alar, which was banned as a probable carcinogen last year after a national scare. But a scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday it was too early to tell if the grower\\textbackslash{}'s initial results will hold up, and that the <b> chemical </b> would require at least two more years of study. Eric Curry of the USDA in Wenatchee said such testing generally requires three orchards in three locations around the state for three years. Spray-N-Grow, a Houston-based company, said initial results on an orchard owned by a Yakima-area grower found trees treated with the <b> chemical </b> produced apples with a significant increase in uniformity of color, sweetness, firmness and harvest time over untreated apples. Bill Muskopf, president of Spray-N-Grow, said the <b> chemical </b> ``provides the same benefits (as Alar) while remaining completely organic and totally non-toxic.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Alar was a synthetic <b> chemical </b> growers used for two decades before a private consumer group issued a report last year saying consumption of apples treated with the <b> chemical </b> increased cancer risk in children. The Environmental Protection Agency banned the <b> chemical </b> later in the year. Unlike Alar, Spray-N-Grow is an organic chemical, a micronutrient that has been proven non-toxic in private tests, <b> company </b> officials said. It has been used by commercial vegetable growers and home gardeners for several years, the <b> company </b> said. The Alar scare pushed prices for organic apples far above those for chemically treated apples. Organically grown red apples were selling for \\$1.29 at a Seattle market Thursday, compared to 39 cents per pound for other red apples. Alar\\textbackslash{}'s most significant benefit was retaining the internal firmness of apples during months of cold storage. That will be tested with the new <b> chemical </b> this year, Spray-N-Grow said. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  abortion women humphrey souter state rights abortions anti-abortion hampshire gilbert adkins issues pregnant pregnancy woman smith birth souter\\textbackslash{}'s control legal </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.417174672343128  \\textbackslash{}n   Feminist leaders said Friday the clock would be turned back 25 years on women\\textbackslash{}'s <b> rights </b> if David Souter is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. ``If we lose this one, we\\textbackslash{}'ll never get it back,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, who is lobbying the Senate to reject the nominee. Smeal said she had read all 200 of Souter\\textbackslash{}'s <b> legal </b> opinions and believes he would work to cut off women\\textbackslash{}'s access to <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> and abortion. Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Souter revealed his opposition to <b> abortion </b> by calling it the ``killing of unborn children.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``That\\textbackslash{}'s the language of the right wing,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Yard said. Souter did not use the words during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings this week, but while New Hampshire attorney general he signed a brief that contained the language. However, during the hearings Friday, Souter said he has not made up his mind on the <b> abortion </b> <b> rights </b> issue and would consider both sides if he is confirmed. ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs. Wade,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Souter in reference to the case that legalized abortion. ``I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up my mind and I would not go on the court saying I must go one way or I must go the other way.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But Yard said that Souter\\textbackslash{}'s repeated reference to the <b> abortion </b> <b> rights </b> position as ``the other side,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' was evidence of where he stood. Smeal and Yard, who have attended most of the hearings, said Souter\\textbackslash{}'s answers to questions on constitutionally protected privacy <b> rights </b> concerning <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> indicated he believed in the concept for married couples, but left open whether single people had the same right. Smeal said the addition of Souter to the court would create the majority needed to whittle away at a woman\\textbackslash{}'s right to <b> abortion </b> and <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> until access no longer existed. ``It would take about 10 years,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. ``First would be a requirement that teen-agers get parental consent for an abortion, then spousal consent.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' She predicted the court then would restrict the time period in which an <b> abortion </b> could be performed and then limit the kind of facility that could do the operation. Those decisions would be followed by requirements that teen-agers get parental consent for <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> requiring a physician\\textbackslash{}'s prescription and later that <b> women </b> get their husbands\\textbackslash{}' consent, Smeal said. ``The last step would be outlawing the sale of <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> to single people,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. ``That would take us back to 1965.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' That year, in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a case involving the sale of contraceptives, the court for the first time recognized a constitutional right of privacy. The decision led to widespread availability of <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> for married and unmarried people. Smeal said women\\textbackslash{}'s ability to get out from under the burden of unwanted pregnancies have been the key to the many advances they have been able to achieve outside the home. Smeal and Yard spoke to a rally organized by NOW across the street from the Capitol. About 150 people opposing the Souter nomination attended. </p> 0.378563889866307  \\textbackslash{}n   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a steadfast foe of legalized abortion, said Friday he has softened his stand for the tactical reason of finally getting an updated <b> abortion </b> law passed in New Hampshire. The conservative Republican, who is running for a <b> state </b> Senate seat even though he retires in January from the U.S. Senate after two terms, said he has long supported <b> abortion </b> only to save the woman\\textbackslash{}'s life, but now would support exceptions for rape and incest victims. In a telephone interview from his Chichester home, Humphrey said he\\textbackslash{}'s easing his stance ``because that\\textbackslash{}'s probably the only way that we can get a bill passed and signed into law that would address the 95 percent of <b> abortions </b> that have nothing to do with rape, incest or the life of the mother.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Earlier this year, Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a bill that would have made <b> abortion </b> <b> legal </b> until the fetus could live outside the womb. Last year, Gregg vetoed a bill to repeal the state\\textbackslash{}'s existing <b> anti-abortion </b> laws, which date from the mid-1800s. Humphrey faces <b> state </b> Rep. Jack Sherburne in the Sept. 11 Republican primary. Sherburne favors <b> abortion </b> rights, as does the incumbent, Republican William Johnson, who is running for Congress. Humphrey said his beliefs haven\\textbackslash{}'t changed and that he hopes the public eventually will agree with him that ``each <b> abortion </b> kills a human being, and a human being is a human being irrespective of his circumstances of conception.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Asked if he would revert to opposing exceptions for rape and incest if the political climate were favorable, Humphrey said, ``That would be my preference. But I don\\textbackslash{}'t expect to see that day.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said he had not discussed his new position with <b> anti-abortion </b> supporters, but expects some criticism. Warren Aldrich, legislative director for New Hampshire For L.I.F.E., would not comment directly on Humphrey\\textbackslash{}'s change, but said his group ``would not take part in sponsoring or originating a bill that permits the taking of an unborn human life because of the circumstances of its conception.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Rape and incest are tragic assaults on a woman\\textbackslash{}'s life, but we do not believe that <b> abortion </b> is in any way therapeutic for the woman,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Peg Dobbie, <b> state </b> director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, was surprised by Humphrey\\textbackslash{}'s new stance. ``He seems like the guy who\\textbackslash{}'s above it, the maverick who stands up for his convictions no matter what,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said.

In developments elsewhere, Cincinnati\\textbackslash{}'s archbishop asked <b> abortion </b> clinic operators to voluntarily refrain from Holy Communion, and Planned Parenthood said it would appeal a ruling upholding the federal government\\textbackslash{}'s right to bar family planning aid to foreign organizations that perform abortions. And in Alabama, a bill that would require pre-abortion counseling and an overnight wait prior to any <b> abortion </b> passed the House of Representatives 79-18 on Thursday. But the measure faces tough election-year opposition in the <b> state </b> Senate. With little debate, Idaho House members voted 54-28 to erase the so-called trigger law, which wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t take effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to outlaw abortion. The repeal measure was forwarded to the <b> state </b> Senate, where it was expected to pass. ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t think anyone in this House would like the <b> women </b> of Idaho to be subject to criminal penalties for having an abortion,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Rep. Gary Robbins, a Democrat who introduced the repeal measure. ``I think the <b> women </b> of Idaho are able to make their own choices, and if they do so I don\\textbackslash{}'t think they ought to be penalized.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The law was adopted by the Legislature in 1973, shortly after the Supreme Court\\textbackslash{}'s Roe vs. Wade decision essentially legalizing <b> abortion </b> on demand through the first two trimesters of pregnancy. If it were to go into effect, the Idaho law would mandate prison terms of two to five years for physicians who perform <b> abortions </b> and one to five years for <b> women </b> undergoing them. The law couldn\\textbackslash{}'t take effect under provisions of Roe vs. Wade, hence the ``trigger\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' desingation. If the high court were to overturn that landmark ruling, and allow states to once again ban abortion, the Idaho law would take effect on a proclamation by the governor. In the Idaho House debate Thursday, <b> anti-abortion </b> lawmakers argued that lifting the threat of criminal penalties ignores the <b> rights </b> of the unborn. ``Some of us are here to speak for those who can\\textbackslash{}'t speak for themselves. Do they not count for something?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' asked Rep. Elizabeth Allan-Hodge, a Republican. ``For those of us who believe it is murder to kill the unborn, we cannot possibly believe we should slap them on the hand and tell them it\\textbackslash{}'s wrong.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In Cincinnati, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk said Wednesday that Roman Catholics who operate <b> abortion </b> clinics or promote <b> abortion </b> <b> rights </b> shouldn\\textbackslash{}'t receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. The head of the Cincinnati Archdiocese stopped short of excommunicating or forbidding Holy Communion to pro-choice activists. ``Catholics who obstinately persist in these activities, while perhaps not formally excommunicated, should not consider themselves properly disposed to participate in receiving Holy Communion,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Pilarczyk said. Pilarcayk\\textbackslash{}'s statement was released after a meeting with <b> abortion </b> opponents who complained that Barbara Rinto, a Catholic who is the new director of Planned Parenthood of Cncinnati, violates church law by operating a clinic that performs abortions. Ms. Rinto has said that her feelings on <b> abortion </b> are ``between me and my God,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and that her beliefs about <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> and reproduction are private. In New York, Planned Parenthood announced Thursday it would appeal a ruling by a federal judge there that upheld a federal policy \\_ instituted under the Reagan administration and continued under President Bush \\_ barring family planning aid to private foreign organizations that perform abortions. The policy, adopted by the Agency for International Development 1984, requires that foreign private health agencies, in return for American grants, certify that they didn\\textbackslash{}'t perform or actively promote <b> abortion </b> as a method of family planning. Planned Parenthood, which assists private foreign agencies, had charged that the policy was a violation of their First Amendment right to advocate <b> abortion </b> and interfered with the <b> rights </b> of privacy of people seeking family planning information. </p> 0.321669305819114  \\textbackslash{}n   A federal judge approved a settlement Thursday that keeps the <b> state </b> from restricting <b> abortions </b> to <b> women </b> less than 18 weeks pregnant. U.S. District Judge John Nordberg agreed to the settlement between Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The court finds the proposed consent decree lawful, fair, reasonable and adequate,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the judge wrote in the 13-page opinion. Anti-abortion groups opposed the settlement, calling it ``unconscionable and unconstitutional.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ragsdale vs. Turnock was settled Nov. 24, just days before the U.S. Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the case. It was one of several that <b> anti-abortion </b> groups had hoped would be used as a test case for the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The settlement permits the <b> state </b> to regulate <b> abortion </b> clinics without removing the availability of <b> abortions </b> to <b> women </b> who are less than 18 weeks pregnant. Under the agreement, access to <b> abortions </b> cannot be restricted by substantially increasing the cost of the procedure or reducing the number of clinics. The lawsuit was brought by Rockford physician Richard Ragsdale, who objected to regulations requiring <b> abortion </b> clinics to be equipped and staffed like small hospitals. He said the regulation was a veiled attempt to restrict access to abortions. One of the requirements deleted from the settlement mandated that patients receive counseling about <b> birth </b> <b> control </b> and adoption and that counselors be people who wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t profit from abortions. The settlement also eliminated a requirement that all <b> abortion </b> clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a ``certificate of need\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' from the <b> state </b> verifying that they do not duplicate similar services in their areas. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  united states trade japan countries foreign world japanese international american economic nations agreement european imports canada europe talks farm america </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.546147065172188  \\textbackslash{}n   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and European Economic Community officials agreed Tuesday to step up <b> trade </b> contacts. Takeshita responded favorably to a suggestion by EEC Commission President Jacques Delors to create a panel of experts to discuss technical aspects of the EEC\\textbackslash{}'s rocky <b> trade </b> relations with Japan, officials said. Takeshita also stressed the need for Japan and the 12-nation EEC to widen their relations beyond <b> trade </b> to cultural and scientific sectors. ``The relationship between Europe and Japan is not very strong or as well developed\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' as that between the United States with Europe and Japan, an aide to Takeshita told reporters. Senior EEC and Japanese officials meet annually. An EEC official said Delors believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in defusing <b> trade </b> tensions. The EEC is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of dumping by Japanese exporters. The EEC official, who asked not to be named, said EEC Foreign Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq noted a ``remarkable improvement in <b> trade </b> relations\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' between the 12-nation <b> trade </b> bloc and Japan, even though the EEC continues to register a large <b> trade </b> deficit with Japan. The gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987, but was still \\$25 billion. For his part, Takeshita said the EEC\\textbackslash{}'s plans to turn the 12 EEC <b> states </b> into a single, borderless market by the end of 1992 was good for Japan. But his aide quoted him as saying, ``The ... single market after 1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and that the EEC should remove restrictions on Japanese exports. But he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade, an issue the EEC has given high priority in order to gain greater access for European goods to the Japanese market. ``We fully understand what (the EEC) Commission people are saying on reciprocity but Japan cannot agree to reciprocity on a sectoral basis,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Takeshita was quoted as saying. Among specific <b> trade </b> issues discussed were Japan\\textbackslash{}'s high taxes on imported liquor and cars, the difficulties of <b> foreign </b> companies\\textbackslash{}' bidding on Japanese public works projects and better access for EEC exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors. The EEC side also urged Japan to liberalize its banking sector. Officials said Delors stressed European banks must be able to establish themselves in Japan to make it easier to finance European exports and investments. De Clercq also called on Japan to quickly comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruling to amend an accord with the United States on <b> trade </b> in semiconductors. The <b> world </b> <b> trade </b> body has ruled the deal discriminates against the EEC. Takeshita also asked Delors\\textbackslash{}' advice as to the best way to distribute \\$500 million Japan has earmarked as special <b> economic </b> assistance to Africa. ``We are aware that European <b> countries </b> have a long relationship with African countries,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the aide quoted Takeshita as saying. </p> 0.522992875103849  \\textbackslash{}n   The United States and Japan reached a <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> Monday that could double U.S. exports of beef and oranges to more than \\$1 billion a year, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. ``My judgment is that this will turn out to be a landmark <b> agreement </b> in U.S.-Japan <b> economic </b> relations,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Yeutter said following marathon <b> talks </b> with Japanese leaders. The <b> agreement </b> calls on Japan to nearly double its <b> imports </b> of beef by 1991, and phase out involvement by Livestock Industry Promotion Corp., which currently controls most beef imports. Japan would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 1991, 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to allow Japanese farmers time to adjust. Japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22,000 tons annually, to 192,000 tons in 1990. After that, fresh oranges from the United States would be permitted in unlimited quantities, at the current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 percent off season. Quotas on orange juice will also be phased out. The United States also demanded and got compensation on tariffs for other <b> farm </b> products in return for concessions on allowing Japan to slowly phase out its tariffs. Included were liberalized restrictions on <b> imports </b> of grapefruit, lemons, frozen peaches and pears, pistachios, macadamias, pecans, walnuts, pet food, beef jerky, sausage and pork and beans. As part of the agreement, the United States agreed to withdraw a complaint filed with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the <b> world </b> body that oversees <b> international </b> trade. The two sides agreed to further discuss Japan\\textbackslash{}'s emergency import curbs during the current round of <b> talks </b> under GATT. The temporary <b> agreement </b> was signed by Yeutter and Takashi Sato, Japan\\textbackslash{}'s agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. Yeutter said the official documents would be signed in Washington, hopefully in the next few weeks, after the United States gathers the documents it needs. Cabinet Secretary Minister Keizo Obuchi welcomed the agreement, telling a regular news conference Monday that ``it reconfirms that the United States and Japan are able to solve their problems through joint efforts.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said the <b> agreement </b> can be fully implemented without hurting Japanese farmers. Yeutter said the <b> agreement </b> ``will require some creative and innovative thinking\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on the part of Japanese officials in helping Japanese farmers adjust. However, he said Japanese consumers will benefit through an increased standard of living and cheaper prices, while Japan\\textbackslash{}'s economy will benefit through increased competition. He said the United States will be closely watching Japan to make sure the <b> agreement </b> is put into effect. A similar pact on computer chips came under attack last year after the United States accused Japan of circumventing the spirit of the <b> agreement </b> by selling computer chips at unfairly low prices through third countries. That battle is still being fought through GATT. Yeutter said that ``it would be unfortunate if government agencies were to attempt to circumvent the spirit of this agreement.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Yeutter also said the United States has no plans at this time to expand its demands to include the liberalization of rice, another thorny issue in Japan-U.S. relations. However, he said he could not rule out that possibility in the future if the United States is provoked. While agreeing to eliminate the beef import restrictions, Japan retained the right to raise the tariffs temporarily by 25 percent if beef <b> imports </b> exceed the previous year\\textbackslash{}'s level by 20 percent. After the transitional period ending in 1993, Japan\\textbackslash{}'s beef tariffs will be subject to discussions in the GATT. Sato, the agriculture minister, said the Japanese government will soon begin negotiations with Australia, another major beef exporter, on the Japanese import restrictions. Associations of Japanese orange growers and cattle farmers criticized the agreement. ``As producers who had been closely following the course of negotiations, we can\\textbackslash{}'t help but keenly feel regret and anger,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mitsugu Horiuchi, president of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, said in a statement. </p> 0.519057517264268  \\textbackslash{}n   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga says a free <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> between his country and the United States is being considered more seriously because recent successes in resolving <b> trade </b> disputes have improved relations between the two nations. It is time to ``build our partnership on the basis of our interlocking strengths instead of constantly warring over our separate weaknesses,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Matsunaga told the Washington Council on International Trade last week. The ambassador said that the much-discussed U.S. <b> trade </b> deficit and the corresponding Japanese <b> trade </b> surplus ``simply do not comprehend\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the scope and complexity of the <b> economic </b> and political relationships between the two countries. ``It is quite understandable, therefore, that thoughtful people on both sides of the Pacific are now considering the possible benefits of some form of free <b> trade </b> arrangement between the United States and Japan, the two largest and most dynamic economies in the world, whose two-way <b> trade </b> is exceeded in value only by America\\textbackslash{}'s <b> trade </b> with Canada...\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Matsunaga said in his Thursday address. A U.S.-Japan free <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> \\_ which essentially would remove <b> trade </b> barriers between the two <b> nations </b> \\_ was proposed first in 1981 by Mike Mansfield, U.S. ambassador to Japan. The initial reaction was widespread skepticism that two <b> countries </b> with such different cultures and legal systems could fashion a workable agreement. But earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd raised the issue with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. And Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and now Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to prepare a report listing the pros and cons of such an agreement. The interest is driven not only by the increasingly complex <b> trade </b> relationship between the two countries, but by concerns by both about their <b> trade </b> relations with other nations. Japan has concerns about how the U.S.-Canada free <b> trade </b> <b> agreement </b> may affect its own <b> trade </b> with the United States and Canada. And both <b> countries </b> are concerned that the lowering of <b> trade </b> barriers among European Community nations, scheduled for 1992, could lead to increased difficulty in gaining access to that market. David Rohr, a member of the federal International Trade Commission who recently visited Japan to gather opinions for the study requested by Bentsen, said the Japanese are ``really scared\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of the sweeping U.S. <b> trade </b> bill \\_ signed into law last week and criticized by Matsunaga as ``disproportionately protectionist\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' \\_ because of its sanctions for unfair <b> trade </b> practices. </p> 0.4786823304804  \\textbackslash{}n   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today opened the most ambitious <b> trade </b> negotiations ever undertaken, urging officials of 90 <b> nations </b> to compromise to resolve <b> trade </b> differences. In an apparent reference to a clash between the United States and its allies on <b> farm </b> subsidies, Mulroney exhorted the delegates to ``be motivated by a spirit of honorable compromise.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Mulroney said farmers around the <b> world </b> ``are looking for results in Montreal. They can no longer survive on a diet of promises.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The round of <b> trade </b> negotiations is designed to liberalize and broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an <b> international </b> trade-policing treaty signed in 1947. GATT now has 96 members, and 90 <b> trade </b> ministers were at today\\textbackslash{}'s meeting. The U.S. delegation has come under strong criticism from Japan, Australia and the European Community over its demand to completely eliminate government supports for farmers. The 12-nation European Community is only willing to reduce them, terming the U.S. position unrealistic. Mulroney urged the negotiators to ``be animated by a spirit of realism,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' echoing similar weekend calls to the United States in preparatory consultations for the mid-term review of the four-year Uruguay Round of <b> trade </b> talks. The United States was further isolated by a tentative accord reached between the Europeans and developing <b> nations </b> that would remove or reduce tariffs on the export of tropical products to the industrialized world. An EC spokeswoman said the United States did not yet support the agreement, which would affect \\$70 billion in internaional <b> trade </b> of such products as jute, bananas and coffee. Michael Duffy, Australia\\textbackslash{}'s Minister of Trade Negotiations, told reporters Sunday that blame for U.S.-European impasse over <b> trade </b> barriers should be shared by the two parties. But he and other officials looked to the Americans to make the first move. Duffy warned that if neither side compromises during the three-day talks, ``it will sour the rest of the round,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' which ends in 1990. The dispute over agricultural subsidies has clouded prospects for progress on other urgent <b> trade </b> problems, such as the inclusion of the booming services <b> trade </b> in the 40-year-old GATT pact and the adoption of safeguards for copyrights and patents. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s hard to see how there can be progress in other areas without progress in agriculture,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said John Crosbie, Canada\\textbackslash{}'s Minister for International Trade. The United States took a conciliatory stand but insisted it would stick to its main objective. Chief agriculture negotiator Dan Amstutz noted the United States had moved away from setting a 2000 deadline for elimination of subsidies and agreed to emergency government food stockpiles as long as they are bought on the open market. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re flexible,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said, but ``we\\textbackslash{}'d rather not have any <b> agreement </b> than a bad one.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The U.S. delegation also appeared to hold out the possibility it would relent on its rejection of a proposal lifting barriers on the export of tropical products, such as bananas and coconuts, by developing nations. U.S. <b> trade </b> negotiator Alan Holmer warned that failure by the GATT round could create ``uncertainties\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in Congress and within the incoming administration of George Bush. He did not elaborate. But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said failure on the <b> farm </b> support issue would result in an ``export-oriented\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' <b> farm </b> bill. Congress is scheduled to draft a <b> farm </b> bill next year and Leahy indicated it would include supports for farmers so they can compete effectively against farmers whose governments also subsidize exports. The United States projects that its 1989 <b> farm </b> supports will amount to \\$13 billion \\_ down from the \\$27 million of 1987 but still a heavy burden on the deficit-ridden budget. U.S. officials say Europeans could save about \\$200 billion every year if they stopped their <b> farm </b> supports. But the EC, under the influence of powerful <b> farm </b> lobbies, says eliminating supports is not a viable option. </p> 0.461372217496813  \\textbackslash{}n   The United States would be happy to consider negotiating a free-trade <b> agreement </b> with Japan along the lines of the treaty reached with Canada, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said Friday. While there are no current discussion about such a treaty, it would fit into this country\\textbackslash{}'s overall strategy to break down <b> trade </b> barriers wherever they exist, he said. ``We have a major trading relationship with Japan,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Baker said. ``It (a free <b> trade </b> agreement) would be something that the United States would be pleased to consider if it were something that the government of Japan wanted to consider.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Baker\\textbackslash{}'s comments came in a television interview with <b> foreign </b> journalists for broadcast outside the United States by the U.S. Information Agency. The session was a preview of the seven-nation <b> economic </b> summit opening Sunday in Toronto. President Reagan, addressing the annual conference of the USIA International Council, meantime, reiterated his belief in free <b> trade </b> while saying <b> trade </b> barriers of other <b> countries </b> are generating protectionist pressures in America. ``It damages the entire <b> world </b> economy when <b> foreign </b> <b> countries </b> fail to offer the same opportunity to American exports that America offers to their products,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Reagan said. ``It is this basic sense of fairness that has helped generate protectionist pressures in America. Let me repeat protectionism, the closing of America\\textbackslash{}'s markets, is the wrong response; opening markets, that, I firmly believe, is the answer.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Meanwhile, there appeared to be movement on another contentious <b> trade </b> dispute between Japan and the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Friday that he was leaving immediately for Japan, saying a deal may be near on ending that nation\\textbackslash{}'s restrictions on beef imports. ``We certainly have not yet reached an agreement, but I\\textbackslash{}'m persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a trip,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Yeutter said. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We remain hopeful,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' but added, ``Until there\\textbackslash{}'s a deal, there\\textbackslash{}'s no deal.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Agriculture Department has placed the overall value of the Japanese beef market at \\$2 billion. A U.S.-Japan free-trade <b> agreement </b> would presumably be of substantial benefit to this country because U.S. officials for years have pressured the Japanese to open their markets to American products as a way of reducing the huge <b> trade </b> imbalance between the two nations. The Japanese ran up a <b> trade </b> surplus with the United States last year of \\$59.8 billion, more than one-third of this country\\textbackslash{}'s America\\textbackslash{}'s overall <b> trade </b> deficit of \\$170.3 billion. The U.S.-Canada pact now being considered by Congress and the Canadian Parliament would end all <b> trade </b> barriers within 10 years. Some critics have charged that specific <b> trade </b> pacts such as the U.S.-Canada <b> agreement </b> or the plan to eliminate all barriers between the 12-nation European Economic Community by 1992 pose risks of returning the <b> world </b> to the <b> trade </b> cartels of the 1930s, which worked to shrink <b> trade </b> rather than expanding it. But Baker disputed this, saying the United States saw any <b> trade </b> liberalization agreements as beneficial. He said America preferred to pursue reduction of <b> trade </b> barriers through the discussions being held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But he hinted that if those <b> talks </b> did not reach a successful conclusion, the United States would look to <b> trade </b> pacts with smaller groups of countries. Baker said the summit between President Reagan and other Western leaders would include a full-fledged discussion of Reagan\\textbackslash{}'s proposal to eliminate all <b> farm </b> subsidies by the year 2000. These subsidies are costing the major industrial <b> countries </b> \\$150 billion annually in higher government support payments and increased food costs to consumers. He acknowledged that the U.S. proposal to eliminate subsidies was facing intense opposition, with Washington hoping basically for a reiteration in Toronto of a pledge the industrialized <b> nations </b> made last month in Paris to press forward in negotiations on the issue. The U.S. delegation, led by Baker, had pressed for more specific language to adopt Reagan\\textbackslash{}'s call for a subsidy-free <b> world </b> in agricultural <b> trade </b> by a specific date. But Baker contended Friday that progress had been made in Paris. ``The fact that we are even discussing this very difficult problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. ``It is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all able to go to our farmers and say the <b> world </b> is going to do this.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' European <b> nations </b> have argued that it is politically impossible to eliminate all <b> farm </b> subsidies and a proper compromise would be to reduce them, perhaps by cutting them in half. The United States is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a Montreal <b> trade </b> meeting in December. The Montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current round of global <b> trade </b> <b> talks </b> which were launched in 1986 in Uruguay and scheduled to end in 1990. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  south africa black african mandela apartheid government anc national klerk white blacks congress sanctions release anti-apartheid end leaders question racial </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.506518336418872  \\textbackslash{}n   Foreign Minister R.F.

Police searched the home of Erhard Loeser, West Germany\\textbackslash{}'s acting consul-general, on Monday.

The ANC proposed a meeting between itself and Buthelezi\\textbackslash{}'s conservative Inkatha Freedom Party ``in the near future,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' but did not specify a date. The ANC statement said both Mandela and Buthelezi should attend. Buthelezi said he welcomed the offer and was ready to consider a suitable time and place for the talks. Mandela is in Australia and will be traveling throughout Asia until early November. Since his <b> release </b> from prison in February, Mandela has turned down invitations from his old friend Buthelezi despite the ongoing violence between their supporters in the eastern province of Natal and in <b> black </b> areas outside Johannesburg. ANC <b> leaders </b> have harshly briticized Buthelezi and accused him of orchestrating the violence to obtain a meeting with Mandela and enhance his stature. Buthelezi has denied the charge and accused the ANC of trying to destroy all rivals. The ANC was conciliatory in its statement Monday. The group said ``it welcomed the steps being taken jointly by the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to stop the violence. The two sides have been holding periodic peace talks, but neither Mandela nor Buthelezi has attended. About 5,000 <b> blacks </b> have died in the ANC-Inkatha power struggle since 1986 in Natal Province. The fighting spread to the Johannesburg area in August and has claimed 800 lives. The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest <b> black </b> opposition movements, both oppose <b> apartheid </b> but differ over tactics and a future South Africa. The socialist-oriented ANC has employed boycotts, strikes, protests and waged an armed struggle, recently suspended, in its battle against the government. Inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors capitalism. The ANC draws support across tribal lines, while virtually all Inkatha members are Zulus. The ANC also has opposed Buthelezi\\textbackslash{}'s role as leader of the KwaZulu homeland in Natal Province. The ANC considers the 10 <b> black </b> homelands part of the <b> apartheid </b> system. Buthelezi, meanwhile, sees the limited self-government in the homelands as an interim step on the road to <b> black </b> majority rule. </p> 0.465480196432289  \\textbackslash{}n   Alan Paton, the country\\textbackslash{}'s best known author, was recovering today from surgery for an undisclosed ailment, a press report said.

Botha, who represented President F. W. de Klerk, addressed the heads of state as ``my African brothers\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' during the informal meeting, which was punctuated by joking and laughter. The breakfast host was Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, head of the seven-nation Frontline States, a regional bloc that once led efforts to <b> end </b> <b> apartheid </b> in South Africa. The other two <b> leaders </b> were President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who maintains close contacts with South Africa, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, the current chairman of the 51-member Organization of African unity. President Bush sent a congratulatory message, saying the meeting ``marks a new era in Africa.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The get-together over eggs, bacon and croissants signaled a further easing of tensions between white-led South Africa and its <b> anti-apartheid </b> neighbors. Zambian officials said it was made possible by de Klerk\\textbackslash{}'s recent steps toward dismantling apartheid, including legalizing the African National Congress, freeing political prisoners including the ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and lifting the state of emergency in <b> black </b> townships. The ANC, outlawed for 30 years in South Africa, had its headquarters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka until early this year. Kaunda, once one of the most vocal African critics of apartheid, said the theme of the meeting was ``peace, unity and reconciliation.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Botha told the <b> black </b> African <b> leaders </b> that South Africa could help economic development in the largely impoverished region, adding: ``We in Africa must join hands and move closer together.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``South Africa must play its rightful role in southern Africa and we are ready to play that role,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Botha said. Ugandan President Museveni said he got the idea for such a meeting from a prayer breakfast he attended with U.S. congressmen two years ago. He wanted to organize something similar, he said, but as he was not a good Christian he asked Kaunda to be host. Three other African heads of state, Quett Masire of Botswana, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and Metsing Lekhanya of Lesotho, were invited but did not attend. </p> 0.443119008127283  \\textbackslash{}n   Zulus fired assault rifles at Xhosas sleeping in a workers barracks early Monday, leaving 22 people dead and pushing the death toll to 364 in a week of tribal clashes, police said. Zulus and Xhosas, the country\\textbackslash{}'s two largest <b> black </b> tribes and longtime rivals, have been waging vicious battles since Aug. 12 in the townships surrounding Johannesburg. Police and eyewitnesses said Zulus armed with AK-47 rifles raided a Xhosa workers hostel early Monday in KwaThema township east of Johannesburg. At least 22 people were killed, many of them Xhosas shot in their beds, they said. Police in armored vehicles moved in after dawn to restore order. Enraged Xhosas set fire to a hostel used by Zulus before being driven off. Fighting also flared in nearby townships, resulting in several deaths. Looters continued to pillage hostels abandoned by Zulu migrant workers. People carted away refrigerators, stoves and anything else they could find. Johannesburg newspapers Monday reported five killings Sunday in the Soweto township by the ``necklace\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' method, whereby youths put gasoline-soaked tires around the necks of victims and set them alight. Police on Monday raised the death toll for the fighting from the past week to 364 and said hundreds were injured. ``We just keep finding bodies. They\\textbackslash{}'re everywhere,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said a police spokesman. The fighting appears to be mostly a tribal conflict with a long history, but it also has political overtones. Nelson Mandela and many other <b> leaders </b> of the African National Congress, the largest opposition movement, are Xhosas. The ANC\\textbackslash{}'s rival, Inkatha, is a Zulu-based organization headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, the system of <b> racial </b> segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and economic control over 30 million blacks. But the two groups differ over tactics and plans for a future South Africa. ANC leader Walter Sisulu ruled out peace talks between Mandela and Buthelezi, saying it would be a capitulation. ``That means Inkatha launches a war in order to bring us to our knees. For that type of thing we are not prepared,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said in a weekend television interview. Mandela\\textbackslash{}'s wife, Winnie, warned the ANC may be forced to resume its armed struggle to protect is supporters. The ANC agreed Aug. 6 to suspend it largely ineffective guerrilla campaign. Mrs. Mandela accused the <b> government </b> of ``working hand-in-hand\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' with the relatively conservative Inkatha movement in the fighting against Xhosas, the independent South African Press Association reported. Also, the <b> government </b> has revoked immunity from prosecution for three ANC leaders, including the head of the group\\textbackslash{}'s military wing, Chris Hani. The three men, Hani, Ronnie Kasrils and Mac Maharaj, also are members of the South African Communist Party, a close ANC ally. The <b> government </b> gave no reason for the decision. But it was seen as a signal that authorities are upset with militant statements made recently by some ANC leaders. The trio are among more than 40 ANC <b> leaders </b> granted temporary immunity three months ago so they could participate in peace talks. All but Hani, Kasrils and Maharaj have had their immunity extended until the <b> end </b> of the year. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  bill house senate committee sen rep congress legislation chairman measure vote year lawmakers congressional members subcommittee republican proposal leader approved </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.48489727105023  \\textbackslash{}n   The House on Thursday rejected a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from desecration, heeding opponents who said it would risk damage to the Bill of Rights. The 254-177 tally left the amendment, which was supported by President Bush, 34 votes short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Republicans voted 159-17 for it, Democrats 160-95 against. The <b> vote </b> followed a sometimes impassioned day of debate featuring more than 100 speeches, including a rare address by the speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``We should not amend the Constitution of the United States to reach the sparse and scattered and despicable conduct of a few who would dishonor the flag and defile it,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Foley, who also cast a rare speaker\\textbackslash{}'s <b> vote </b> to register his opposition to the amendment. By tradition, the speaker does not normally engage in debate or vote. Countered Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``Let us take the flag out of the gutter where the counterculture has dragged it and is smearing it. We have 10 amendments that guarantee us all sorts of rights. How about one amendment that gives us a duty?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Foley told reporters that Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s <b> vote </b> would be the last one on the amendment this <b> year </b> in the House, but Republicans promised to keep the issue alive. ``I am confident this debate is going to go on for a long time,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told the chamber. Asked about the Bush\\textbackslash{}'s efforts on behalf of the amendment, Gingrich said ``it was very hard for the president in two days to override the speaker.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Supporters of the amendment, backed by veterans\\textbackslash{}' groups seeking more time to lobby, had tried to delay Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s <b> vote </b> until next week but were defeated 231-192. Rep. Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., the <b> chairman </b> of the House Veterans Committee and the amendment\\textbackslash{}'s prime Democratic sponsor, said of the proposal, ``I think we owe it to the brave Americans who have died for this country.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., decried the attempt to modify the First Amendment. ``When I look around the politicians today, I see more people who remind me of Daffy Duck than Thomas Jefferson,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. The strength of the opposition was larger than expected and was aided by the unexpected support of some conservatives. ``Up until 24 hours ago, I was a sponsor of this amendment,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C. ``But over the rhetoric of the past few days, I finally heard the voice of my own conscience.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The amendment read, ``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' It was first proposed in 1989 after the Supreme Court ruled that flag burning was a form of protected free speech. The issue was revived last week when the court rejected last year\\textbackslash{}'s attempt to pass an anti-flag-burning law that the court could accept. After the <b> vote </b> on the amendment, the House also rejected a new statute \\_ not a constitutional amendment \\_ to ban flag burning. The bill, narrowly drawn in hopes of avoiding court rejection, would impose fines and jail terms for people who burn flags to promote violence or who burn flags on federal property or belonging to the federal government. Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after their leadership called it a ``fig leaf\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' to protect Democrats who opposed the constitutional amendment, and it lost 236-179. The Senate is expected to <b> vote </b> next week on the amendment, which would require a two-thirds <b> vote </b> in both chambers, and approval by 38 of the 50 states, for ratification. Foley said the House would not <b> vote </b> again this year. Regardless of the outcome on Capitol Hill, Republicans promise to raise the issue in this fall\\textbackslash{}'s campaign. The House majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., acknowledged the political tightrope <b> members </b> were walking. Several <b> members </b> decorated their speeches with flags and other props. Rep. Gary Ackerman, trying to highlight the difficulty of enforcing <b> legislation </b> to protect the flag, held aloft a wide variety of household items and gags decorated with the stars and stripes. ``How about American flag napkins,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said, holding one. ``What if you blow your nose in one. Have you broken the law?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Although Ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the debate, Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he was offended. Most Republican speakers supported the amendment; the bulk of opposition came from Democrats. There also was a noticeable generational tilt in the debate. House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., a decorated World War II veteran, co-sponsored the amendment and called it ``a measured, prudent, limited thoughtful approach to the problem.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Surely this is something different from the `assault on the Bill of Rights\\textbackslash{}' some critics say it is,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., another World War II vet, used photographs of the famed Iwo Jima flag raising and of a flag-burning protest in New York\\textbackslash{}'s Central Park to dramatize his support for the amendment. But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a Vietnam veteran who said he would ``never forget the sacrifices that have been made so that our flag can fly proudly and freely,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' was a <b> leader </b> of the opposition. ``In 200 years of our history, these basic freedoms have never been amended, never. And if we start now, who knows what freedoms will be next? ... Where will it end?\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he asked. </p> 0.457894118691134  \\textbackslash{}n   In an election-year bow to an agency that serves one-third of all Americans, the Senate voted Tuesday to give the Veterans Administration a seat in the president\\textbackslash{}'s Cabinet. The <b> bill </b> was passed by an 84-11 vote. The House <b> approved </b> similar <b> legislation </b> last November, a week after the idea was advanced by President Reagan. Negotiators from the the Senate and House will work out minor differences between the two bills. The Department of Veterans\\textbackslash{}' Affairs would become the 14th in the Cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 1989. Sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard in the highest councils of government. Opponents called the <b> bill </b> another example of <b> congressional </b> pandering to special interests. ``In recent years the VA has frequently been relegated to a relatively insignificant role within the executive branch, with the administrator having little or no access to the president or other top officials in the White House,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., <b> chairman </b> of the Senate Veterans\\textbackslash{}' Affairs Committee. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who has been promoting a veterans\\textbackslash{}' department since 1975, said his support is not aimed at getting more money for veterans. ``Given the nature and scope of the VA, it is appropriate that we make it an executive department ... (to) ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively administered.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., a former Veterans Committee chairman, opposed creation of the Cabinet seat. He bitterly criticized some veterans\\textbackslash{}' service organizations for supporting the <b> bill </b> while they fought another measure, passed Monday by the Senate, that would allow courts to overturn some VA decisions on veterans\\textbackslash{}' benefits. ``If anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice ... than they already have, then I\\textbackslash{}'ve missed something in the nine years I\\textbackslash{}'ve been year,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Simpson said. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the <b> bill </b> ``absurd... silly... goofy... illogical ... irresponsible. This is rubbish. This is unprincipled (prostitution) after special-interest groups.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' According to the Veterans\\textbackslash{}' Affairs Committee, VA serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of \\$30 billion, making it the largest independent federal agency. It will dispense \\$14 billion in income maintenance and \\$626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that converting the VA into a Cabinet department would cost \\$33 million over five years. The biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on VA buildings. The <b> bill </b> would reorganize VA operations and allow the secretary of veterans\\textbackslash{}' affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and 15 deputy assistants. The <b> legislation </b> requires that the top operating officers \\_ the chief medical director and chief benefits director \\_ be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard to politics.

Herbert Callahan, D-Ala., was paid \\$12,000 in director\\textbackslash{}'s fees from the Finch Companies. Although Democrats, who control the House, were paid the most for their speechmaking, Republicans shared in the wealth. Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois reported \\$49,300. Rep.

As part of a <b> bill </b> raising their government salaries, House <b> members </b> agreed that 1990 will be the last <b> year </b> they will receive honoraria. Senators will allow themselves lower government salaries than House <b> members </b> after this <b> year </b> but will keep their speaking fees. In addition to their speaking fees and other honoraria, <b> members </b> of Congress and most other federal officials are required to disclose their assets, not including their homes; their investments, most liabilities and gifts. The forms require that values be listed only by broad category. For example, a multimillion-dollar holding is reported only as worth more than \\$250,000. Some <b> members </b> are more precise. Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., whose seniority and Appropriations Committee position make him one of the most powerful House members, listed no speaking fees, no gifts, no liabilities, no investment transactions and no membership in any organization. He listed nine properties valued at \\$144,978 from which he collected \\$4,200 in rent, and the \\$4,131 savings account that earned \\$212 interest. Not all are so lucky in their finances. Rep. Tommy F. Robinson, R-Ark., who switched parties last year, listed among his liabilities more than \\$250,000 he owes Jerral W. Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Jones\\textbackslash{}' daughter left a \\$60,000-a-year job on Robinson\\textbackslash{}'s staff last <b> year </b> after the congressman and Jones had a falling out over Robinson\\textbackslash{}'s plans to run for governor. Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., reported assets of between zero and \\$5,000 with no liabilities. On the other hand, Gephardt, who sold rental homes in Missouri last year, had no liabilities but assets of as much as \\$915,000. Rep. William Green, R-N.Y., an heir to the Grand Union food stores, reported one of the highest 1989 incomes among House members, at least \\$507,857 and perhaps as much as \\$1.26 million. His campaign <b> committee </b> returned to him between \\$100,000 and \\$250,000 of personal funds he had invested in his 1984 re-election effort. </p> 0.385928898412753  \\textbackslash{}n   The Senate passed <b> legislation </b> today that would permit the death penalty for drug dealers convicted of murder, rejecting pleas that the <b> measure </b> would be a move toward ``reducing the civility\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' of society. The election-year <b> legislation </b> was sent to the House on a 65-29 vote. The bill\\textbackslash{}'s fate is less certain in that chamber, where the House Judiciary Committee \\_ which will consider it \\_ has been hostile to capital punishment <b> legislation </b> in the past. ``Murder is murder, whether legal or illegal,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash. ``We are reducing the civility and the compassion of our society.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But Sen. Alfonse D\\textbackslash{}'Amato, R-N.Y., the bill\\textbackslash{}'s sponsor, said, ``I believe society has a right to say we are outraged at certain acts, and the death penalty is the appropriate penalty in these cases.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Before final passage, <b> lawmakers </b> voted 66-28 to set aside a provision by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., that would have limited the bill\\textbackslash{}'s capital punishment provisions to drug dealers who are convicted of killing law enforcement officers. On voice votes, they accepted a provision that would allow prison employees to refuse to participate in executions, and rejected language that would have required prisoners to be killed in public. Both measures were sponsored by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore. On Thursday, the Senate voted 69-27 to shut off debate, ending a filibuster by opponents who had stalled a vote. ``I\\textbackslash{}'m not saying the death penalty will eliminate the drug problem, but I do think it will serve as a deterrent,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said D\\textbackslash{}'Amato. But opponents decried the <b> bill </b> as election-year politics, saying it would do nothing to deter drug dealing and represented a cynical response to public demands to do something about illegal drugs. Evans referred to a similar <b> bill </b> proposed in 1986 and said: ``Once again, we\\textbackslash{}'re going for an election-year slam dunk on drugs. ... We\\textbackslash{}'re taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political vanity.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The D\\textbackslash{}'Amato <b> bill </b> provides that the death penalty can be imposed on people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring and who are then separately convicted of killing law enforcement officers or private citizens. Many states, including those with severe drug problems, already have the death penalty and it hasn\\textbackslash{}'t had much deterrent effect, opponents of the <b> bill </b> said. Before invoking cloture, the Senate voted 65-31 against an amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment without parole, instead of the death penalty, for people convicted under the terms of D\\textbackslash{}'Amato\\textbackslash{}'s bill. D\\textbackslash{}'Amato\\textbackslash{}'s <b> proposal </b> was originally attached as an amendment to the Pentagon budget bill, but opponents filibustered and D\\textbackslash{}'Amato withdrew his <b> proposal </b> in return for a promise by Senate leaders to give him a <b> vote </b> on a separate bill. Supporters said the death penalty would deter drug kingpins. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said, ``To go on talking about a war on drugs and not commit ourselves to a death penalty for those who kill our law enforcement officers in that war is to make a mockery of saying we have a war on drugs.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said, ``The evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent is just not there at all.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., added that the death penalty provision could lead to the execution of innocent people. He cited a Stanford University study which said 350 people have been convicted of capital offenses in this century and then later found to be innocent. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, responded that there are enough safeguards in the legal system to protect innocent persons. ``Nobody should be able to kill our policemen without paying the ultimate price,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Also Thursday, the House Banking Committee <b> approved </b> <b> legislation </b> to make it more difficult for drug dealers and other criminals to hide their profits. The <b> bill </b> would require banks to file transaction reports with the government for all cashiers\\textbackslash{}' checks, money orders and travelers\\textbackslash{}' checks of \\$3,000 or more. Now, banks need to file such reports on transactions of \\$10,000 or more. New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, meanwhile, was proposing the creation of ``tent jails\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in Nevada to incarcerate convicted drug offenders and relieve prison overcrowding elsewhere. In an appearance before two House Armed Services subcommittees, Koch conceded that Nevada probably wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t think much of his idea. </p> 0.371477202794283  \\textbackslash{}n   The <b> chairman </b> of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says presidents should be sworn in earlier because the 2\\{ months between Election Day and Inauguration Day creates an unnecessary ``period of vulnerability.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``The incumbent president no longer has real political authority and the incoming president lacks constitutional authority, and the whole world knows it,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Friday. ``It is a period of vulnerability which can and should be eliminated.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' In a Senate floor speech introducing a resolution for a constitutional amendment, Pell said the change would eliminate ``10 weeks of crippled leadership\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and avoid an ``unhealthy and unnecessary situation.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The senator wants to move up Inauguration Day for the president and vice president from Jan. 20 to Nov. 20. The constitutional amendment also would move the swearing-in day for Congress from Jan. 3 to Nov. 15. Pell has introduced similar measures in the past. With time quickly running out in this session of Congress, action this <b> year </b> appears unlikely. From 1793 to 1933, the swearing in of new presidents took place March 4. The 20th Amendment pushed it back to Jan. 20 beginning in 1937. Pell, who introduced the resolution along with Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., said the move also would avoid `@lame duck\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' administrations in which officials might be ``tempted to expend funds, make contracts and grants and promulgate regulations that may be either politically motivated or inspired by sheer self-interest.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Pell said the development of voting machines and instant election result tabulations eliminates the justification for the long lag time between elections and inaugurations. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  stores store sales food market customers nordstrom goods consumers christmas shopping retail clothing chain bread prices video employees buying department </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.409647116339293  \\textbackslash{}n   America\\textbackslash{}'s No. 1 <b> video </b> <b> chain </b> is swallowing No. 3 in a \\$40 million deal that gives Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. a total of more than 1,700 stores. Blockbuster agreed to acquire Erol\\textbackslash{}'s Inc. of Springfield, Va., a <b> chain </b> of 208 outlets that pioneered the <b> video </b> rental business in 1980 but has struggled amid management shuffles and stiff competition. The deal ``provides an outstanding opportunity for Blockbuster and its franchise owners to broaden the base of ourstores,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Blockbuster chairman and chief executive officer H. Wayne Huizenga said Monday. Erol\\textbackslash{}'s, the nation\\textbackslash{}'s third-largest <b> chain </b> behind West Coast-National of Philadelphia, has <b> stores </b> in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland and Chicago as well as 112 <b> stores </b> in the Washington, D.C., area, where Blockbuster has only 48 outlets and was looking to expand. Blockbuster, based in Fort Lauderdale, opened its 1,500th <b> store </b> Monday, in Vancouver, British Columbia. In all, the <b> chain </b> has <b> stores </b> in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Canada and England. Erol\\textbackslash{}'s founder and principal stockholder, Erol Onaran, said the buyout was in the best interest of his 2,600 employees. ``It was going to be a fight,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said analyst Drew Beja at Advest Securities. ``And Blockbuster had the resources to win the fight.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Onaron founded Erol\\textbackslash{}'s as a stereo repair shop in Washington in 1963. It was an early pioneer in the <b> video </b> industry, opening <b> stores </b> exclusively devoted to rentals in 1980, and led all other <b> video </b> chains in revenue until Blockbuster surpassed it in 1988. But Erol\\textbackslash{}'s has been stagnating since then, and didn\\textbackslash{}'t begin to sell franchises until last August, said Frank Molstad, editor of Video Store magazine. In contrast, Blockbuster has been expanding by 400 to 500 <b> stores </b> a year since Huizenga bought the company in 1987 for \\$19 million, and Huizenga has said <b> sales </b> this year could top \\$1 billion. Erol\\textbackslash{}'s had revenue of \\$100 million last year, said Jerry Falkner, an analyst at Southwest Research Partners in Boca Raton. While more than 1,700 <b> stores </b> by the end of the year, Blockbuster will still have only about 10 percent of the home <b> video </b> market, said Fran Blechman Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. </p> 0.400430825039905  \\textbackslash{}n   Hopes for a successful Christmas <b> shopping </b> season all but vanished after the nation\\textbackslash{}'s biggest retailers said their business continued to deteriorate in October. Several companies including Sears, Roebuck \\& Co. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported Thursday that their <b> sales </b> dropped from levels of a year earlier as consumers, preoccupied with concerns about the economy and the Middle East, avoided <b> buying </b> anything they didn\\textbackslash{}'t need. The disappointing October <b> sales </b> followed poor showings in August and September, and with Christmas less than seven weeks away, retailers and the industry analysts who track their performance expect <b> consumers </b> to remain frugal during the holiday season. ``They\\textbackslash{}'ll probaby be going in and <b> buying </b> the same number of items, but they\\textbackslash{}'re not going to pay as much ...\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. ``They\\textbackslash{}'re not going to buy \\$100 electronic toys for their kids, not this year.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Analysts said shoppers will be looking harder for bargains and waiting longer for price reductions than in past years. ``They\\textbackslash{}'re going to be busy spending fewer dollars,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Daniel Barry, an analyst with Kidder Peabody \\& Co. Consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait raised the specter of war, inflating <b> prices </b> of gasoline and home heating oil. The first items crossed off <b> shopping </b> lists were so-called discretionary items - clothing, furniture, home appliances and other extras that are the <b> bread </b> and butter of many big stores. If retailers have a difficult Christmas, it could contribute to a further deterioration of the economy, since two-thirds of the nation\\textbackslash{}'s economic growth is generated by consumer spending. Unsold <b> goods </b> on <b> store </b> shelves could also affect manufacturing - if <b> stores </b> don\\textbackslash{}'t place new orders, factories don\\textbackslash{}'t need to provide as many products and could lay off workers. And a poor Christmas season could be devastating for the retailers themselves, as they depend on holiday <b> shopping </b> for about half their annual <b> sales </b> and profits. Christmas 1989 was a disappointment for many storeowners after they were forced to slash <b> prices </b> to attract customers. Sears, the country\\textbackslash{}'s largest retailer, said October results from <b> stores </b> open at least one year fell 0.4 percent from a year earlier, while overall <b> sales </b> dropped 1.2 percent. Analysts believe <b> sales </b> from <b> stores </b> open at least a year - also known as same-store or comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> - provide a more accurate assessment of a retailer\\textbackslash{}'s performance than overall <b> sales </b> do. New <b> stores </b> tend to have extraordinarily strong <b> sales </b> that can skew a retailer\\textbackslash{}'s results. One of the hardest hit last month was Penney, which said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> fell 6.3 percent from October 1989, while overall <b> sales </b> dropped 4.9 percent. Limited Inc., the nation\\textbackslash{}'s largest specialty apparel retailer, reported comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> dropped 1 percent as overall <b> sales </b> rose 13 percent. Apparel <b> stores </b> were also affected by continuing warm weather in some parts of the country. May Department Stores Co., parent of big <b> department </b> <b> store </b> chains including Lord \\& Taylor, Hecht\\textbackslash{}'s, Filene\\textbackslash{}'s and Foley\\textbackslash{}'s, said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> dropped 4.4 percent, while overall <b> sales </b> edged up 1.1 percent. But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the biggest discount retailers, continued to outperform the rest of the <b> retail </b> industry, reporting comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> rose 10 percent while overall <b> sales </b> rose 25 percent. Analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores, especially those going into the Christmas season with high inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales. These retailers are expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise - and see their profits evaporate. Markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers, having seen one round of price reductions, wait for more merchandise to be marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts. When one retailer lowers prices, it pressures others to follow. Among other reports from retailers Thursday: -Dayton Hudson Corp. said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> rose 4.1 percent, while overall <b> sales </b> picked up 16.7 percent. -Kmart Corp. reported a 1.3 percent <b> sales </b> gain at comparable stores, and an 11.2 percent rise overall. -Woolworth Corp. said comparable <b> store </b> <b> sales </b> increased 1 percent, while overall <b> sales </b> rose 4.2 percent. The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly <b> retail </b> <b> sales </b> report from the government. The Commerce Department\\textbackslash{}'s figures includes <b> sales </b> from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealers. </p> 0.381226494643611  \\textbackslash{}n   The signs say ``Always Open,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' but for the first time in 35 years, most of the 1,200 Denny\\textbackslash{}'s restaurants across the United States will close their doors for Christmas Day. Locking those doors is a different story. Some buildings have been without locks for decades because of the always-open policy. At others, the locks have never been used and the keys can\\textbackslash{}'t be found. The company is having to install locks at about 700 restaurants, said Joe Herrera, director of marketing at the company\\textbackslash{}'s southern California headquarters. The company decided to close this year so <b> employees </b> could have the day off. ``It will cost us about \\$5 million in sales,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Herrera said. The chain\\textbackslash{}'s 60,000 <b> employees </b> were so grateful for the holiday that many sent cards and letters of appreciation to the offices, Herrera said. Employees received normal pay for Christmas Day. ``We just feel we spend 364 days a year taking care of other people\\textbackslash{}'s families; for one day a year we want to take care of our own,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said. Nobody wants to work on Christmas, he said, and it has been the top turnover day of the year, with some managers losing four or five employees. In Hollywood, the companywide closing solved manager Almaz Legesse\\textbackslash{}'s problem of choosing which <b> employees </b> of a Sunset Boulevard restaurant to give the day off. ``I had a big list. ... I was having a hard time,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. The restaurant, which serves more than 1,700 Christmas customers, was awaiting a visit from a locksmith. ``We never had locks,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ms. Legesse said. ``After so many years of working Christmas every year it\\textbackslash{}'s real nice,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Lee Sevene, a manager at a Denny\\textbackslash{}'s near a turnpike in Portland, Me. ``People have always thanked us a lot for staying open,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Frances Bushman, manager of a Pismo Beach, Calif., Denny\\textbackslash{}'s. ``On the other hand they always felt sorry for our waitresses and cooks,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. Ms. Bushman\\textbackslash{}'s Denny\\textbackslash{}'s has locks but she had to check to see if the keys fit. Christmases in the past have been about twice as busy as average days at Denny\\textbackslash{}'s, Herrera said. ``We have up to an hour wait sometimes on Christmas, and that\\textbackslash{}'s all day \\_ not just at midday,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Herrera said. ``It actually starts on Christmas Eve, and just keeps going.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The Christmas closing applied to 1,221 restaurants. The operators of 174 franchise restaurants were allowed to make their own decisions. Winifred Gibson, a manager at two Denny\\textbackslash{}'s franchise restaurants in Fresno, Calif., said they would remain open for the biggest day of the year. But she sympathized with the trouble of locking up a Denny\\textbackslash{}'s. ``Once I needed to lock the doors on my store. It was a major fiasco. It took us a day to find the keys,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Ms. Gibson said. Christmas Day used to bring in mostly single people, couples with no children or elderly people with no family, she said. ``But not anymore. You have so many one-parent families.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The three franchise Denny\\textbackslash{}'s in Anchorage, Alaska, and one in Fairbanks will be open, said Donna Flanagan, manager of an Anchorage restaurant. Ms. Flanagan expects to serve about 1,500 people on Christmas, which is second only to Mother\\textbackslash{}'s Day in bringing in customers. </p> 0.363127625659827  \\textbackslash{}n   Travelers on France\\textbackslash{}'s superhighways will soon be able to dine on hamburgers at roadside fast-food restaurants.

The opening of the Nordstrom <b> store </b> at the Garden State Plaza <b> shopping </b> mall in Paramus, N.J., marks the retailer\\textbackslash{}'s first foray into the fiercely competitive Northeast. The official debut occurs Friday when the 245,000-square-foot <b> store </b> opens for business. Members of the media were given a preview tour of the <b> store </b> Tuesday. Operating in this area might pose the biggest challenge yet for the West Coast <b> chain </b> that has been migrating eastward as part of an ambitious expansion. A struggling regional economy has shaken consumer confidence and crimped spending. Crisis in the Middle East could further curb <b> retail </b> spending as the critical holiday season approaches. Nonetheless, Nordstrom executives seem optimistic about entering the <b> market </b> and private analysts say the retailer stands a good chance to thrive here. Its service-oriented brand of retailing, combined with broad assortments of reliable quality merchandise, will give it an edge over rivals with less favorable reputations, analysts say. ``I think it\\textbackslash{}'s probably one of the best \\_ if not the best \\_ <b> department </b> <b> stores </b> in the country,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Management Horizons, the <b> retail </b> management and <b> market </b> research division of the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. ``The fact that the competition is in such a state of disarray might make it a good time to go into the Northeast.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Richard Pyle, a <b> retail </b> analyst at Piper Jaffray \\& Hopwood Inc., said Nordstrom, which focuses on women\\textbackslash{}'s, men\\textbackslash{}'s and children\\textbackslash{}'s fashions, shoes and accessories, is in far better financial shape than its competitors. Some <b> department </b> stores, such as Macy\\textbackslash{}'s \\_ which is a Nordstrom neighbor at the Garden State Plaza \\_ are courting <b> customers </b> aggressively to boost business and pay off debts. Others, such as Saks Fith Avenue, are adjusting to life under new owners who are closely monitoring bottom lines. The 61-store Nordstrom <b> chain </b> dates back to 1901 when Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom founded a Seattle shoe shop with money made mining gold in Alaska. Nordstrom still emphasizes shoes; the Paramus <b> store </b> boasts an inventory of some 70,000 ladies\\textbackslash{}' shoes and 30,000 men\\textbackslash{}'s. The <b> chain </b> has historically prided itself on top-notch service and stories abound about its <b> sales </b> associates going to unusual lengths to please people. ``Nordies\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' have been known to personally deliver merchandise to customers\\textbackslash{}' homes and to write thank-you notes to <b> customers </b> \\_ typically on their own time. The legendary service has been a key to landing <b> customers </b> in new markets. As elsewhere, the Paramus <b> store </b> employs personal shoppers who will help <b> customers </b> select apparel, assemble outfits and accessorize. A concierge stationed near the entrance will steer <b> customers </b> in the right direction and handle special requests. Shoppers have three restaurants to choose from on the store\\textbackslash{}'s three levels and a spa offering massages, facials, manicures, pedicures and waxing. James F. Nordstrom, one of three descendents of the founder who currently bear the title co-chairman, said shoppers appreciate being treated well no matter what part of the country they live in. Apart from minor adjustments in merchandise mix, he said there have been no special adaptations made in bringing the Seattle-based retailer east. The <b> chain </b> already operates two <b> stores </b> in the Virginia suburbs of Washington and intends to open two more in New Jersey over the next two years, plus one in New York in 1993. Its growth strategy calls for about four openings a year. ``We just think <b> customers </b> like a lot of selection, good quality and to be treated nicely,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said in a telephone interview from the company\\textbackslash{}'s headquarters. One blot on the Nordstrom name appeared earlier this year when the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries, acting after a union complaint, ruled that the company has failed to pay <b> employees </b> for some of the extras they provide. The agency ordered Nordstrom to properly compensate <b> employees </b> for work and to pay back wages. Industry analysts say Nordstrom has weathered the bad publicity without much damage to its reputation. A \\$15 million reserve the company set aside to pay back wage claims should be adequate. James Nordstrom said the labor problems, which have been confined mostly to the Seattle area, haven\\textbackslash{}'t impaired the retailer\\textbackslash{}'s results. Many <b> employees </b> have proven their commitment to the company, he said, by paying their own way to transfer to new stores. The Paramus <b> store </b> will have about 100 <b> sales </b> associates who have previously worked elsewhere for Nordstrom. An additional 100 managers were transferred by the company, which has a policy of promoting from within. About 900 <b> employees </b> overall will work at the Garden State Plaza store. Nordstrom\\textbackslash{}'s <b> sales </b> and profits haven\\textbackslash{}'t been as impressive lately as they had been in the recent past. Earnings slid 20 percent in the first half of this year to \\$49 million on <b> sales </b> of \\$1.36 billion. That deterioration came after a 7 percent income drop last year to \\$115 million despite a 14.7 percent <b> sales </b> gain to \\$2.7 billion. Nordstrom also has felt the pinch of the currently sluggish <b> retail </b> climate. Co-chairman Nordstrom said, ``It\\textbackslash{}'s fair to say that our planned increase in <b> sales </b> is greater than the increase we\\textbackslash{}'re experiencing.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' He said the retailer is taking a conservative approach to the coming season and will tighten inventory slightly. If business doesn\\textbackslash{}'t measure up chainwide for a prolonged period, Nordstrom may scale back its expansion plans. ``We\\textbackslash{}'re not going to leverage ourselves and grow for growth sake,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Nordstrom said, noting that some openings may be delayed if necessary. At the Paramus store, <b> retail </b> analysts say the company is hoping <b> sales </b> will exceed \\$100 million in the first year. Nordstrom executives declined to disclose projections. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  chrysler thompson ford auto motor corp motors assembly general uaw car cars industry domestic vehicles lee trucks truck vehicle sales </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.47906131784782  \\textbackslash{}n   Chrysler Motors Corp. on Tuesday named Thomas Stallkamp chairman and Forest Farmer president of its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.

Under severe use, one or more of the bolts securing the front brake disc <b> assembly </b> can loosen, the company said, posing a potential danger of front brake failure. The rear brakes are unaffected and Honda hasn\\textbackslash{}'t had any reports of accidents blamed on the defect, the company said.

Mike Venezia, the rider of more than 2,000 winners in more than 21,000 races since 1964, died in the fifth race on Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s card, officials said. Robbie Davis, the rider of the other horse, was taken to a hospital for treatment of shock. Venezia\\textbackslash{}'s mount, a 3-year-old gelding named Mr. Walter K., was humanely killed. Venezia, 43, was the first jockey killed at a New York Racing Association track since March 29, 1982, when Amado Credidio died after he was thrown over the top of a horse onto the ground and into the path of several other horses in a race at Aqueduct. Venezia\\textbackslash{}'s mount broke his right foreleg going down the backstretch of a 1 1-16 mile allowance race. Venezia attempted to pull up the gelding, then went off the horse to his left and fell crosswise on the track, directly in the path of the other horse, Drums in the Night. ``I think he was dead when the (ambulance) technician got to him,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Dr. Leo Skolnik, the examining NYRA physician, said. ``He was apparently kicked in the face. He had no pulse, no respiration and his pupils were dilated and fixed. ``I don\\textbackslash{}'t see how a fall to the ground could have sustained this kind of injury.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The last four races of Thursday\\textbackslash{}'s card were canceled. Racing was to resume today and a memorial service was to be held for Venezia, who had planned to retire at the end of this year. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  news cbs nbc television network abc rating broadcast show ratings cable week series sports season coverage time today abc\\textbackslash{}'s olympics </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.712860894989505  \\textbackslash{}n   ABC only got a silver in the <b> ratings </b> the first <b> week </b> of Winter Olympics coverage, but ABC\\textbackslash{}'s ``World News Tonight\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' was golden for the first <b> time </b> since August, snapping CBS\\textbackslash{}' 20-week win streak. The first two nights of the Olympics, Saturday and Sunday, varied widely in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, but according to ABC averaged higher than the first two nights of the 1984 games. An estimated 25 million viewers saw Sunday night\\textbackslash{}'s coverage, featuring pairs figure skating, putting it in the top 10 with a 19.7 <b> rating </b> and a 30 share. But Saturday\\textbackslash{}'s <b> coverage </b> of hockey was in the bottom 10 with a 9.9 <b> rating </b> and 17 share. The <b> rating </b> is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are tuned to that program. The first two nights of the 1984 games were a Tuesday and a Wednesday, and had a combined <b> rating </b> of 13.8 compared to 15.5 for this year, said ABC. ABC\\textbackslash{}'s highest rated <b> show </b> of the <b> week </b> wasn\\textbackslash{}'t the Olympics, but the conclusion of the two-part miniseries ``Elvis and Me,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the highest-rated miniseries so far this season. But NBC handily won the <b> week </b> ending Feb. 14, with an average prime-time <b> rating </b> of 16.2. ABC was second with 14.9. CBS was third with 14.2. After winning 19 of the 21 weeks so far in the season, NBC has an average <b> rating </b> of 16.4, and CBS and ABC are tied with 13.6.

The ``CBS Evening News\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' had an 11.1 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' had a 10.9 and 19. Network analysts had no immediate explanation for ABC\\textbackslash{}'s showing. However, last week\\textbackslash{}'s <b> ratings </b> could have been affected by <b> coverage </b> of the Iowa caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential race. ``We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or <b> coverage </b> of Chernobyl, and with live programming like the Iran hearings and political coverage,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said ABC News spokeswoman Elise Adde. ABC\\textbackslash{}'s prime-time special on Iowa ranked a respectable 44 out of 68. It followed the conclusion of ``Elvis and Me.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' NBC\\textbackslash{}'s Iowa <b> coverage </b> ranked 63rd. CBS delayed its <b> coverage </b> of Iowa until 11:30 p.m. EST, after prime time.

Nevertheless, the first three nights of <b> coverage </b> did land in the top 10 in the Nielsens last week, the final <b> week </b> of the <b> broadcast </b> year. Sunday night\\textbackslash{}'s Olympics <b> coverage </b> was No. 2 among all prime-time shows, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., with a <b> rating </b> of 17.7 and a 30 share. Saturday\\textbackslash{}'s <b> coverage </b> came in ninth, with a <b> rating </b> of 16.1 and a 31 share. The opening ceremonies Friday ranked 10th, with a 15.2 and 29. The <b> rating </b> is a percentage of the nation\\textbackslash{}'s estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The 1984 games averaged a 23.5 rating. People meters, the new viewer-measuring devices that have shown overall lower numbers for <b> network </b> shows, combined with a decline in <b> network </b> viewing may contribute to a depression in Olympics <b> ratings </b> this year. The first three nights of the Olympics averaged about a 30 share, somewhat lower than the third of the viewing audience NBC had predicted. NBC analyst Jeff Boehme said it was too early to tell if there\\textbackslash{}'s a trend in the Olympics ratings. Monday night\\textbackslash{}'s Olympics <b> broadcast </b> continued to score disappointingly in the ratings, though it won the night for NBC. The <b> coverage </b> during prime <b> time </b> rated 18.0 with a 28 share. CBS had a 14.5 for the night, and ABC a 12.9. CBS effectively programmed against the Olympics on Sunday night with a repeat of the Valerie Bertinelli movie ``Rockabye\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that ranked fourth in the Nielsens. CBS also scored with its timely ``48 Hours\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on the approach of Hurricane Gilbert, getting the highest <b> rating </b> yet for the weekly <b> news </b> program. It ranked 12th with a 14.1 <b> rating </b> and 24 share. NBC won the <b> week </b> ending Sept. 18 with an average <b> rating </b> of 14.0. CBS and ABC tied with 11.5 each. The <b> week </b> marked the 52nd since the 1987-88 fall <b> season </b> began, so NBC claimed its fourth broadcast-year win in a row with an average <b> rating </b> of 14.5. Although CBS finished third for the regular <b> season </b> that ended in April, based on yearlong figures, CBS edged ABC for the <b> broadcast </b> year with an average <b> rating </b> of 12.2 to ABC\\textbackslash{}'s 12.1. The top 10 shows last <b> week </b> were: ``A Different World\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' NBC, ``Summer Olympics \\_ Sunday\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' NBC, ``The Cosby Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' NBC, ``Rockabye\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' CBS, ``Monday Night Football\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ABC, ``60 Minutes\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' CBS, ``Barbara Walters\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ABC, ``Murder, She Wrote\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' CBS, ``Summer Olympics \\_ Saturday\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``Summer Olympics \\_ Opening\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' NBC.

The <b> news </b> race last <b> week </b> continued to be a virtual dead heat, with less than a point separating the three <b> network </b> newscasts. CBS had a 10.8 <b> rating </b> and 22 share, ABC had 10.3 and 21, and ``NBC Nightly News\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' had a <b> rating </b> of 10.1 and a 20 share. </p> 0.621504460950423  \\textbackslash{}n   ABC\\textbackslash{}'s ``Roseanne\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' edged NBC\\textbackslash{}'s ``The Cosby Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' as prime-time <b> ratings </b> champ in the just-concluded 1989-1980 season, NBC announced Monday. ABC\\textbackslash{}'s Tuesday comedy starring Roseanne Barr averaged a 23.3 rating, two-tenths of a <b> ratings </b> point more than the Bill Cosby family comedy which has been first in the Nielson <b> ratings </b> for the last four seasons. ``The Cosby Show,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' wound up in second place for the season. Cosby\\textbackslash{}'s <b> series </b> has been on the air for six seasons, and Barr\\textbackslash{}'s <b> series </b> for two. Each <b> ratings </b> point represents 921,000 homes. Final figures for the 30-week season, which ended Sunday, won\\textbackslash{}'t be available until Tuesday. But <b> network </b> research analysts say that NBC will easily win its fifth consecutive season, with ABC coming in second, and once-dominant CBS in third place for the third straight season. Still awaiting final figures for the last three days of the season, Preston Beckman, NBC vice-president for research, said that NBC thus far had a 14.6 <b> ratings </b> average, ABC a 12.9 and CBS a 12.2 during the season. NBC\\textbackslash{}'s <b> ratings </b> are down by nine percent, ABC\\textbackslash{}'s are flat, and those of CBS are down by three percent, he said. He cited competition from cable, the fledgling Fox network, and independent stations as factors in the overall <b> ratings </b> drop. However, he attributed 25 percent of NBC\\textbackslash{}'s decline to the absence of three <b> sports </b> events it had in prime <b> time </b> during the previous <b> season </b> \\_ the Summer Olypmics, the World Series and pro football\\textbackslash{}'s Superbowl. </p> 0.598854649155634  \\textbackslash{}n   Two new situation comedies starring Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, respectively, are gone from CBS\\textbackslash{}' schedule, the <b> network </b> announced Tuesday in a schedule shakeup that dumps two of the three CBS shows produced by Grant Tinker\\textbackslash{}'s GTG Entertainment. The network, which has ranked last in the <b> ratings </b> so far this season, said ``Annie McGuire,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' starring Miss Moore, would have its last <b> broadcast </b> in its Wednesday <b> time </b> period on Dec. 28, suggesting it might be brought back in the future. But the <b> network </b> said ``The Van Dyke Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``Raising Miranda,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the GTG shows, would have their final broadcasts this month. ``Dirty Dancing,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' a half-hour <b> show </b> based on the hit movie of the same name will go ``on hiatus\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in January. ``Simon \\& Simon,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the long-running, on-again, off-again detective series, has its last <b> broadcast </b> in its Saturday <b> time </b> period on Dec. 31. CBS left the door open to reviving it yet again. GTG Entertainment was established by former NBC chairman and MTM Productions head Grant Tinker in partnership with Gannett. Tinker founded MTM Productions with his then-wife, Mary Tyler Moore. The third GTG <b> show </b> for CBS, the critically praised ``TV101,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' an hourlong, teen-appeal drama, is being moved next month from its low-rated Tuesday <b> time </b> slot to Wednesday in place of the Moore and Van Dyke shows. GTG has also not fared well with its only other current TV enterprise, the syndicated newsmagazine <b> show </b> ``USA Today: The Television Show,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' though the company insists it is sticking by that <b> show </b> for the long haul. In the most recent <b> ratings </b> from the A.C. Nielsen Co., ``Annie McGuire\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``The Van Dyke Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' were the lowest-rated <b> network </b> shows of the week. ``Raising Miranda\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' was the third lowest-rated <b> show </b> last week. Both ``Annie McGuire\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``The Van Dyke Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' had problems from the start. Both pilots were re-shot and the Moore <b> show </b> was partially recast. They then emerged to almost universally negative reviews, even though their stars are two of the most popular sitcom performers ever. Moore and Van Dyke co-starred in ``The Dick Van Dyke Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in the 1960s, and Moore starred as Mary Richards in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in the 1970s. CBS announced that ``Tour of Duty,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' a Vietnam series, will return to the schedule Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST. ``Dolphin Cove,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' starring Frank Converse as a dolphin researcher in Australia, will join the schedule in January in place of ``Dirty Dancing\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' and ``Raising Miranda\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' on Saturday night.

The message came after Iraq warned its own people not to hide foreigners or they would face the ``severest punishment.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Iraq had threatened earlier to use the trapped foreigners as shields, and today\\textbackslash{}'s statement by the official Iraqi News Agency said some had already been scattered at the target sites. The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a spokesman for the Iraqi National Council as saying: ``Iraq\\textbackslash{}'s foreign guests have been in fact moved to all vital and military installations. They have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in good physical condition.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' The three-line dispatch provided no further details, such as how many foreigners had been moved or to what installations. Earlier, President Bush demanded that Iraq release all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, and for the first time he referred to them as hostages. ``There can be little doubt that whatever these innocent citizens are called, they are in fact hostages,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' he said in a speech to <b> war </b> veterans in Baltimore. Also today, two senior U.N. officials headed for Baghdad to urge Iraq to free foreigners held captive in Kuwait and Iraq. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein requested the envoys be sent. In his speech, Bush repeated U.S. demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. He also likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler. An Iraqi official also referred to World War II today, reminding the United States that it had once interned members of its own ethnic Japanese population. ``In response to the official American and Western declarations regarding Iraq\\textbackslash{}'s hosting of foreigners ... We would like to recall that America, during World War II, held about 100,000 of its own citizens of Japanese origin in detention camps to avert a potential Japanese attack on its western coast,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said the statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. It was attributed to the Speaker of the Iraqi National Council, or parliament, Sadi Mehdi Saleh. The United States, meanwhile, picked up another ally in its military thrust against Iraq with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney\\textbackslash{}'s announcement <b> today </b> that U.S. C-130 cargo transports have begun operating from the United Arab Emirates. Cheney\\textbackslash{}'s statement in Abu Dhabi marked an important show of cooperation from a <b> gulf </b> nation with international efforts to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Also today, OPEC said there was not enough support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider Saudi Arabia\\textbackslash{}'s request to boost oil production. A brief statement said OPEC\\textbackslash{}'s president would meet with some other oil ministers before the end of the month. Saudi Arabia said Saturday it would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels a day. Iraq said <b> today </b> that diplomats who fail to close their missions in Kuwait by Friday will be treated as any other foreign citizen. But in London, the Foreign office said Britain will attempt to keep an embassy in Kuwait. Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and West Germany said they had no plans to close their missions in Kuwait. The Iraqi radio message, monitored in Nicosia, warned Iraqi citizens against secretly sheltering foreigners to protect them. ``Hosting a foreigner in an Iraqi\\textbackslash{}'s place of residence is considered a flagrant violation of the law, for which the severest punishments will be given,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' it said. It said the law applied ``with (Iraq\\textbackslash{}'s) entire administrative border\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' \\_ apparently including annexed Kuwait. On Sunday, Saddam offered to free foreigners if the United States withdraws its <b> forces </b> from the Persian Gulf region and guarantees the economic embargo will be lifted. U.S. officials dismissed the offer. He later said he would free citizens of <b> nations </b> that remain neutral in the conflict, including those of Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Portugal. They account for only about 600 of the 21,000 foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. There was growing international anxiety over the fate of the remaining foreign captives, including 3,000 Americans and 4,000 Britons, held for almost three weeks. Saddam said Sunday Westerners will be held at vital Iraqi installations to deter U.S. attacks on the facilities. ``Our people are seeking to avert a catastrophe,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Saddam said, in comments read on Iraqi television. ``The presence of the foreigners with Iraqi families at vital targets might prevent an attack.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Iraqi authorities also ordered Westerners in Kuwait to assemble at hotels or face the consequences. In other developments: \\_The White House said U.S. warships were still ``shadowing\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' two Iraqi tankers, which ignored warning shots fired by the U.S. vessels on Saturday. \\_U.S. warships off the United Arab Emirates were challenging by radio practically every commercial ship coursing up and down the Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported today. \\_Iraq said <b> today </b> that Indonesian and some Argentine citizens may leave. \\_China\\textbackslash{}'s official Xinhua News Agency said the first group of 97 Chinese would be evacuated from Iraq today, with Baghdad\\textbackslash{}'s help. Also today, 122 Soviet citizens crossed into Jordan, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. \\_The British Foreign Office said <b> today </b> that 82 Britons were taken Sunday by Iraqi authorities from a hotel in Kuwait city. A day earlier, 41 British citizens were taken from the Kuwait International hotel. \\_Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal arrived in Damascus, Syria <b> today </b> to discuss the Gulf <b> crisis </b> with the Syrian leadership. \\_Two Dutch Navy frigates were leaving <b> today </b> for the Persian Gulf to join the multinational force arrayed against Iraq. The air defense frigate Witte de With and the standard frigate Pieter Florisz were to take two weeks to reach the region. \\_ Greece also said it would send a frigate. \\_Iraqi soldiers <b> today </b> continued their withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing up thousands of battle-hardened <b> troops </b> to face U.S. forces. Iraq and Iran were also repatriating prisoners from their eight-year war, which effectively ended with a cease-fire in August of 1988. \\_Iranian newspapers <b> today </b> attacked the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. The Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial the United States had virtually annexed Saudi Arabia, just as Iraq did Kuwait. But the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S. military presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. United Arab Emirates, an alliance comprising seven sheikdoms, <b> today </b> became the first of the moderate Arab governments in the southern <b> gulf </b> region to publicly announce overt military cooperation with the United States. On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates announced it would allow the deployment of Arab and ``friendly\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' <b> forces </b> on its territory as part of multinational efforts to defend the Persian Gulf region. On Saturday night, the U.N. Security Council unanimously demanded that Iraq let all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait leave. CBS News said from Baghdad that 35 Americans, including four women and three children, took refuge at U.S. diplomatic ``quarters\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' in the Iraqi capital Sunday. Asked about the report, a spokesman at the State Department said: ``We can\\textbackslash{}'t make a comment on that at this time.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.431678616653974  \\textbackslash{}n   Twenty-five Portuguese stone masons returned to their homeland Thursday after Iraqi authorities allowed them to leave Baghdad. The workers finished contracts last week to install marble in a palace for President Saddam Hussein on the banks of the River Tigris in the Iraqi capital. A spokesman for the group, Joao Cacador, said Baghdad authorities granted exit visas to the Portuguese after the Iraqi company supervising work on palace appealed to Saddam\\textbackslash{}'s office on their behalf. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, on working visit to Spain, said he was overjoyed to hear the Portuguese men had left Iraq. Iraq has held thousands of foreigners in their country in the aftermath of the Aug. 2 <b> invasion </b> of Kuwait, including Westerners in strategic sites thought to be the targets of a possible U.S. attack. </p> 0.420465917711322  \\textbackslash{}n   The Foreign Ministry said <b> today </b> Iraq\\textbackslash{}'s failure to free 1,000 Soviets could lead to a ``tougher attitude\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' toward Iraq\\textbackslash{}'s <b> invasion </b> of Kuwait. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin demanded the immediate release of the Soviets. He also told reporters Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq for four hours <b> today </b> to reiterate the demand that Iraq withdraws its <b> troops </b> from Kuwait. Churkin said Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia would meet with Shevardnadze on Tuesday to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis. He said Iraq agree to allow 1,000 Soviets, mostly contract workers, to leave during November but that only about 350 were permitted to do so. When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there were about 8,000 Soviets, including several hundred military advisers, in Iraq. About 3,000 Soviets, including women and children, were allowed to leave shortly after the <b> invasion </b> and about 1,000 left during September and October.

Baghdad accuses Bush of planning a <b> war </b> against Iraq, attempting genocide by sponsoring U.N. sanctions on Iraq for its <b> invasion </b> of Kuwait, and committing aggression against Panama and Grenada, according to Hamid Al-Rawi, chairman of Iraq\\textbackslash{}'s bar association and head of a panel preparing for the trial. ``Bush has committed many crimes since he took office as president of the United States and also before that when he was vice president,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' the English language Baghdad Observer quoted Al-Rawi as saying in today\\textbackslash{}'s editions. He was quoted as saying the United States, which has sent more than 150,000 <b> troops </b> to the Persian Gulf to counter Iraq, had committed ``a crime against peace, punishable by international law.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Al-Rawi said the trial would be an ``international process\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' with witnesses from other countries and Arab and non-Arab jurists. It would be conducted on the same basis as the Nuremberg trials of Nazi <b> war </b> criminals following World War II, he said. Other accusations against Bush include the enforcement by the United States ``of an economic blockade against the people of Iraq with the aim of starving children, women and elderly to death, and also preventing food, medicine and baby milk from reaching the country in violation of the the U.N. charter.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``This is a crime punishable by international conventions which consider this an act of genocide,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Al-Rawi was quoted as saying. AlRawi did not say what the punishment might be if Bush is convicted during the three-day trial. </p> </details> \\textbackslash{}n<details> \\textbackslash{}n \\textbackslash{}t\\textbackslash{}n                <summary>  film art movie arts works artists collection disney films entertainment american sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s company stars pictures theaters actors grants auction stolen </summary> \\textbackslash{}n <p> 0.562245781749375  \\textbackslash{}n   Andy Warhol\\textbackslash{}'s plastic wristwatches of Fred Flintstone, Judy Jetson and Gumby reached \\$2,640 in a ``wild\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' bidding war \\_ \\$2,590 more than the timepieces cost the late artist in a department store, Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s said. Kitschy collectibles were only some of the objects on sale Wednesday during the fifth day of the 10-day <b> auction </b> of Warhol\\textbackslash{}'s possessions. There was also serious jewelry on the block. American Indian art, including ``no end of turquoise jewelry\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' was to be sold at today\\textbackslash{}'s auction, said Diana Brooks, president of Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s North America. So far, Warhol\\textbackslash{}'s <b> collection </b> has fetched \\$9,072,000, more than twice Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s high estimate of \\$3,951,000. Only 37 out of some 1,400 lots have not sold, she said. The highest bid Wednesday was \\$55,000 for a pair of surrealist ear clips by artist Salvador Dali, according to Ms. Brooks. The buyer, a private collector, was not identified. The ear clips, asymmetrical ruby-studded hearts with a honeycomb center set with round diamonds, had a pre-sale estimated value of \\$10,000 to \\$15,000. An 18-karat gold, garnet and diamond circular pendant, also by Dali, brought \\$47,300, Ms. Brooks said. The pendant, estimated at \\$7,500 to \\$10,000, depicted the profiles of Tristan and Isolde separated by a chalice. The brightly-colored cartoon watches, made by Lewco, were decorated with raised, full-length figures of Fred and Dino, his pet dinosaur; Judy Jetson standing with hands on hips; and a smiling Gumby. Warhol bought them in 1985 and 1986 at Bloomingdale\\textbackslash{}'s, Ms. Brooks said. In their original plastic packaging, the watches bore the original price tags of \\$20 and \\$10, she said. ``People were so wild to have the three plastic watches in the sale. They sort of symbolize the sale of the whole <b> collection </b> \\_ something people will remember,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' she said. The pre-sale estimate was \\$60 to \\$80 for all three. But in ``wild bidding\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' that came down to a telephone contest between four people, the price climbed to \\$2,640, Ms. Brooks said. A private collector, who was not identified, won the bidding. Bloomingdale\\textbackslash{}'s still sells the watches in some stores, said Miraed Smith, a store spokeswoman. Another wristwatch that did well at the <b> auction </b> was a stainless steel piece, dated 1948, with a photo image of Gene Autry and signed ``always your pal Gene Autry.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s estimated it would sell for \\$50 to \\$100 but it went for \\$1,870, Ms. Brooks said. Proceeds from the <b> auction </b> will benefit the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which will award <b> grants </b> to cultural institutions in the United States and abroad. Warhol died at age 58 last year. </p> 0.520168825055959  \\textbackslash{}n   Claude Monet\\textbackslash{}'s Impressionist painting of his wife in a meadow became the third highest priced work at <b> auction </b> Tuesday, going for \\$24.59 million to an anonymous telephone bidder, Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s said. The price for ``Dans La Prairie\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' (``In the Meadow\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}') broke the record for a Monet set 24 hours earlier at Christie\\textbackslash{}'s, which sold his painting of a blue house for \\$6.55 million, also to an anonymous telephone bidder. The two sales of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture by the rival firms totaled nearly \\$123.5 million. Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s also sold a Monet landscape for \\$2 million and set a record price for Pierre Bonnard, whose painting of a woman in her bath fetched \\$3.78 million. A picture of two women musicians by Henri Matisse sold for \\$2.83 million. Only one buyer of <b> works </b> realizing more than 1 million pounds (\\$1.72 million) was identified: Japan\\textbackslash{}'s Fujii Gallery paid \\$2.17 million for Pierre-Auguste Renoir\\textbackslash{}'s portrait of a young woman in a yellow hat. ``The picture of his wife was Monet\\textbackslash{}'s most important work to appear on the market for 20 years,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s expert, Michel Strauss. ``There was ferocious bidding which lasted for five minutes between two people on the telephone and no one in the saleroom appeared to be bidding while it was going on,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Fiona Ford, Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s spokeswoman. Auctioneer Julian Barran opened the bidding at \\$6.8 million after Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s had estimated the picture to be worth around \\$10.3 million. The highest <b> auction </b> prices have been paid for flower paintings by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. His ``Irises\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' sold to an anonymous buyer at Sotheby\\textbackslash{}'s in New York last November for \\$53.9 million. Van Gogh\\textbackslash{}'s ``Sunflowers\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' was bought by a Japanese insurance <b> company </b> at Christie\\textbackslash{}'s in London in March 1987 for \\$39.85 million. Monet, a Frenchman known as the father of Impressionism and the greatest master of that style, painted his wife in 1876 when they were living at Argenteuil near Paris. The summery picture depicts Camille in a white dress and hat, with a parasol behind her, reading a book as she lies among tall grass and wild flowers. The picture was sold by trustees of the estate of the late David David-Weill, an <b> art </b> collector who bought it about 1938 in Paris from the <b> art </b> dealers, Wildenstein. </p> 0.479530940677886  \\textbackslash{}n   Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday it will prohibit paid screen advertising in all <b> movie </b> <b> theaters </b> showing the company\\textbackslash{}'s films. The policy will begin in March with Disney\\textbackslash{}'s release of the <b> film </b> ``Pretty Woman.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' ``Our patrons don\\textbackslash{}'t dislike screen advertising, they hate it,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Richard Cook, president of Disney\\textbackslash{}'s Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Audiences, he said, ``do not come to experience the mundane. They come to escape it. We must not so insult our paying guests (with commercials) and we won\\textbackslash{}'t.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Disney plans to enforce the anti-ad policy by revoking a theater\\textbackslash{}'s license to show Disney movies if it shows advertisements. Cook said the action was essential to the continued financial health of the exhibition of motion <b> pictures </b> in <b> movie </b> theaters. ``We have been told repeatedly by moviegoers that they do not want and will not tolerate commercial intrusions in <b> movie </b> theaters,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Cook said in remarks given at the 1990 convention of the National Association of Theater Owners. The Disney announcement was greeted by some groans. A number of theater owners depend on paid advertising to generate extra income. Terry Laughren, president of Screenvision Cinema Network, the nation\\textbackslash{}'s leading cinema advertising company, said such advertisements bring theater owners millions of dollars annually. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s real money. It\\textbackslash{}'s not pocket change,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Laughren, whose <b> company </b> has placed ads in about 35 percent of the nation\\textbackslash{}'s 17,500 first-run <b> movie </b> theaters. Cook said Disney won\\textbackslash{}'t demand that <b> theaters </b> break existing contracts with advertisers, but the <b> company </b> will encourage the theater owners to get out of such contracts. Disney defines screen advertisements as commercials for goods and services projected on the screen in the same theater where Disney <b> films </b> are shown. Previews of upcoming attractions, slides projected for products during intermission and approved charitable advertisements are not affected by the ban, Disney said. </p> 0.469867410541381  \\textbackslash{}n   Occasionally, an <b> art </b> theft reads like the plot from an Ian Fleming thriller in which half-mad billionaires pay slick international thieves to steal famous paintings for their private pleasure. In reality, experts said Monday, most <b> art </b> is <b> stolen </b> to earn a quick buck in an international black market that is second in size only to the drug trade. The priceless <b> art </b> <b> stolen </b> Sunday from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is too famous to be sold anywhere, raising the spectre that the pieces could be held hostage for ransom for a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars the <b> art </b> world says the paintings are worth. The true scale of the <b> art </b> underworld is difficult to gauge, but investigators say <b> art </b> thievery is increasing as prices for <b> works </b> on the legal market soar. ``There\\textbackslash{}'s a lot of it going on,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Robert W. Holmes Jr., a Boston attorney specializing in fine <b> art </b> transactions. ``Ninety percent of <b> stolen </b> <b> art </b> is never recovered. There\\textbackslash{}'s obviously a market there.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Rarely, one end of the market is held up by someone who decides to commission the theft of a painting that cannot be legitimately acquired. One such theft occurred in 1983, when thieves stole Italian Renaissance masterpieces, including Raphael\\textbackslash{}'s self portrait, from the Hungarian national museum in Budapest. Investigators found that a sophisticated band of Italian <b> art </b> thieves, armed with cutting tools and high-tech alarm-busting devices, executed a perfect break-in and vanished with the works. An extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home country before they could get the paintings to Greece where, it was later found, an olive oil baron had paid a handsome sum for the sake of having the <b> works </b> hang in his home. ``There aren\\textbackslash{}'t many thieves with that sort of expertise,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Robert Volpe, a former New York City police detective who worked on the Hungarian case and is now a private consultant tracing <b> stolen </b> <b> art </b> around the world. ``They were capable of stealing anything.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' But most of the black market in <b> art </b> is in lesser-known <b> works </b> usually ranging in value from \\$100,000 to \\$300,000. Priceless <b> works </b> such as the Vermeer taken from the Gardner Museum are simply too famous to be sold anywhere. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s incredibly stupid to steal a Vermeer or a Rembrandt,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' said Steven Keller, a private security consultant who was brought in as security director at The Art Institute of Chicago after a major theft of three <b> works </b> there by Cezanne in 1979. ``He (the Gardner thief) has got some things that are too hot to handle,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Keller said. Keller said lesser-known <b> works </b> and prints that could be sold more easily were more valuable to thieves than masterworks that couldn\\textbackslash{}'t be fenced. ``You might be able to sell say, a lesser-known American artist\\textbackslash{}'s painting in Europe,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Keller said. ``It\\textbackslash{}'s harder to spot them.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Often, thieves who can\\textbackslash{}'t sell <b> stolen </b> <b> art </b> underground hold it ransom for insurance money, a scenario several investigators and curators said was likely in the Gardner theft. Last year, for instance, thieves stole three paintings by van Gogh, demanded a \\$2.2 million ransom and returned one of the works. The others were later recovered and four people suspected of the theft were arrested. ``It happens, and it happens frequently,\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Holmes said. ``But like any hostage situation, it\\textbackslash{}'s got to be outside the public eye, so often these cases go unnoticed.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' Keller, noting the relative worth of the <b> art </b> <b> stolen </b> from the Gardner Museum, said, ``If I were the thief of the Gardner paintings, I\\textbackslash{}'d ship the Vermeer and the Rembrandt back to the museum and go for a ransom on the smaller works.\\textbackslash{}'\\textbackslash{}' </p> 0.459234620845154  \\textbackslash{}n   Woody Allen has added his next three <b> pictures </b> to his exclusive agreement with Orion Pictures Corp. as writer, director and producer.

Thursday\\'s ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis apparently affects only those who were in training when time the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; ended their walkout, said E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. Still, Breen said, ``It\\'s clearly a major victory.\\'\\' All but 200 of the 3,600 &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; walked off the job in sympathy with Machinists who struck the Miami-based &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; in March 1989. Pilots ended their sympathy walkout in November, but fewer than 50 have been called back to Eastern, &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; association officials say. The Machinists are still striking. At least 404 &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; were in training when the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; returned to work, the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; association says. The &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; estimates only 180 jobs are affected by the ruling, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. Further hearings likely will be determine the exact number of affected jobs, Breen said. Eastern said in a statement it would appeal the decision. The &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; predicted the ruling wouldn\\'t immediately affect current &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; or operations. Many &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; took jobs with other &lt;b&gt; airlines &lt;/b&gt; after the strike began March 4, 1989, but about 1,400 former Eastern &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; may still be interested in returning, pilots\\' association spokesman Lou Baldwin said. Davis\\' ruling stems from the association\\'s challenge of Eastern\\'s claim that the formerly striking &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; were not needed. Davis agreed that the federal Railway Labor Act guarantees returning strikers job rights ahead of newly hired trainees. Davis said Eastern violated the Railway Labor Act by hiring pilot trainees not already qualified to fly regular flights. The act was devised to provide ``uninterrupted transportation service,\\'\\' the ruling said. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike began. It presently operates about 800 flights, down from its pre-strike &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; of 1,040. Ms. Ceremsak said she does not believe Davis\\' ruling must receive bankruptcy court approval. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, all returning &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; would need to go through several weeks of recertification training under the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern officials said. Eastern currently has about 1,900 pilots, including those trained before the strike was settled, &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; hired from other &lt;b&gt; airlines &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; who later crossed picket lines. Baldwin said the Eastern &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; trainees\\' annual pay is about $27,000. The average pre-strike pay at Eastern for fully accredited &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; was about $65,000, he said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.429109398698947  \\n   The chairman of Texas Air Corp. Friday defended a decision by the company\\'s subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, to lay off 4,000 &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; and cut &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; as a way to ``stabilize the company\\'\\' by cutting losses. Frank Lorenzo, testifying at a federal court hearing on Eastern\\'s plans to eliminate &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; to 14 cities, said the layoffs and schedule changes were a necessary step to save the financially troubled carrier. ``If Eastern\\'s management is not permitted to take the actions to save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,\\'\\' Lorenzo said, rejecting suggestions by &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; attorneys that he was trying to bust organized &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; at Eastern by transferring the carrier\\'s assets to Continental Airlines, another Texas Air property. Three &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; unions &lt;/b&gt; that represent Eastern &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; have challenged the plans and obtained a temporary restraining order that bars the &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; from making layoffs. U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker is holding hearings on the union\\'s bid for a permanent injunction. Lorenzo defended the proposed cutbacks ``as an attempt to stabilize the company ... and decrease the losses.\\'\\' Eastern currently is in federally supervised contract negotiations with two of its unions, the Association of Air Line Pilots and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Lorenzo denied suggestions that Texas Air planned to merge Eastern\\'s operations into Continental. Union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that Lorenzo was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air had purchased Eastern. The draft said that the purchase of Eastern gave Texas Air leverage over the unions. ``Eastern\\'s airplanes can be repainted and moved over to Continental where they will be flown by non-union pilots,\\'\\' the speech draft said. But Lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking firm. It was unclear from the testimony if Lorenzo ever delivered that portion of the speech. &lt;/p&gt; 0.40322963681166  \\n   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it has canceled its contract with Orion Air Inc. to provide strike-replacement pilots, but pledged to remain flying in the event of &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; troubles. Eastern, preparing for tough negotiations with the Machinists &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; on its expiring &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; pact, had contracted with Orion in case its own &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; refused to cross picket lines, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. But U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington ruled in March that the deal with Orion violated the existing contract between Eastern and its &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; union. Replacements cannot be trained until a strike begins, the judge said. Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., is one of the largest U.S. operators of aircraft for the small package industry. Miami-based Eastern, the nation\\'s sixth-largest airline, is a subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp. The Transport Workers Union filed a similar suit in April, accusing Eastern of using its planes to train Orion &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants to break a strike. Ms. Ceremsak refused to attribute the cancellation of the Orion contract to Eastern\\'s legal setbacks, however. The contract was terminated ``for sound business reasons,\\'\\' said Ms. Ceremsak. ``Beyond that I can\\'t elaborate.\\'\\' The decision to end the contract does not mean that financially troubled Eastern will shut down if the Machinists walk out, the spokeswoman said. ``We do have plans to operate in case of a strike,\\'\\' she said. ``But our first priority is still reaching a settlement\\'\\' with the Machinists. J.B. Stokes, a spokesman for the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; at Eastern, said the federal court decisions against Eastern left the carrier with no choice. ``This is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey court orders,\\'\\' said Stokes. ``The judge said you cannot train (replacement) &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; in any capacity until such time as there is a strike.\\'\\' The cancellation will cost Eastern about $5.5 million under a provision of the Orion contract, Stokes said. Ms. Ceremsak refused to comment on any provisions of the contract or its cancellation. &lt;/p&gt; 0.386984049004294  \\n   The obscure cargo &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; that Eastern Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces questions about its safety record as the government decides whether it is fit to carry passengers. Few &lt;b&gt; air &lt;/b&gt; travelers have ever heard of Orion Air, a North Carolina cargo carrier which serves such &lt;b&gt; air &lt;/b&gt; freight companies as United Parcel Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator. But if &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; strife intensifies at Eastern, many of that airline\\'s customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion _ and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up scrutiny of the airline. Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion, including the leasing of 26 of Eastern\\'s jetliners, that call on the &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; to take over much of Eastern\\'s routes if &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; and mechanics go on strike. Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; and ground workers, Eastern officials said. But the FAA has yet to approve Orion for passenger service, and a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against Orion because of past safety violations. An FAA inspection report on Orion shows ``a large number of serious safety infractions,\\'\\' said Anthony Broderick, the FAA\\'s associate administrator for aviation standards. Broderick said the airline\\'s management has taken actions ``to permit Orion to safely operate its cargo business\\'\\' and training and maintenance procedures ``are being corrected to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\\'\\' At congressional hearings Tuesday, James L. Heffernan, an Orion vice president, said problems cited by the FAA have been corrected. Heffernan called Orion\\'s safety record excellent and maintained that much of the FAA\\'s concerns stemmed from a ``misunderstanding\\'\\' by FAA inspectors about Orion\\'s method of record keeping. ``Orion Air responded to each of the FAA\\'s proposed findings last summer and are still in the process of resolving these issues. Obviously, if any of the issues compromised &lt;b&gt; air &lt;/b&gt; safety, the FAA would not have allowed Orion Air to continue to operate,\\'\\' Heffernan continued. But Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairman of the House government operations and transportation subcommittee, called Orion ``an &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; in near-shambles\\'\\' and raised questions about its fitness to fly passengers. In an interview, Steven Kolski, a vice president of Eastern, said Eastern executives believe Orion\\'s past safety problems have been resolved. He expressed confidence that the airline\\'s fitness will be assured before the FAA allows it to engage in passenger-carrying flights. ``We got a report that said they (Orion) are a hell of a lot better today than they were a year ago and that most, if not all, of their problems were behind them and they were in good shape,\\'\\' said Kolski. Kolski said Eastern is relying on the agreement with Orion to keep Eastern\\'s &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; going if its 10,000 mechanics go on strike and its 4,000 &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; refuse to cross the picket lines. But FAA officials were not as certain that all of Orion\\'s safety shortcomings are behind it. The FAA cited ``systemic difficulties\\'\\' with the airline\\'s training program, record keeping and use of operational handbooks that are not yet corrected. And the agency disclosed it was seeking civil penalties against Orion for past violations, although no amounts were cited. ``Once the systemic problems have all been corrected, the FAA will turn its attention toward developing an appropriate enforcement package, including a proposed fine\\'\\' for past violations, Broderick said. Orion\\'s problems stem from safety violations found in early 1987 _ violations that attracted little public attention because Orion\\'s 55 jets were carrying only cargo. Among the findings by FAA inspectors were a shortage of required training records; inadequate auditing of maintenance facilites; poor documentation on the qualifications of ``check pilots\\'\\' who decide on the performance of line pilots; incomplete &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; operations manuals, instances of &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; failing to go through required refresher training; and training programs that did not meet federal standards. In a related development Tuesday, the FAA made public a report on improvements Eastern Airlines has made in its own maintenance program since the &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; was fined a record $9.5 million two years ago. The FAA said that Eastern has made ``substantial progress\\'\\' to correct past deficiencies, but that some concerns remain about the airline\\'s deferred maintenance program and repeated problems with certain equipment. Nevertheless, Eastern officials hailed the latest FAA findings which showed that corrective actions had been taken in 52 of the 53 areas cited by the FAA two years ago. ``We are very pleased. This report shows that Eastern has corrected the deficiencies,\\'\\' said Kolski. &lt;/p&gt; 0.34912563695709  \\n   Northwest Airlines is offering &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants two free first-class tickets anywhere in the world for reporting as scheduled for holiday duty. It\\'s an attempt to cut down on sick calls over the holidays. In a recent letter to workers, Northwest in-flight services chief Lloyd Warren thanked &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants in advance for reporting for holiday duty. And as ``a token of our thanks,\\'\\' Warren said, two free round-trip tickets in first-class seating would be given to &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants who report as scheduled between Dec. 15 and Jan. 1. Northwest employs more than 8,000 &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants. To qualify, workers must be scheduled for flights on Dec. 24, Dec. 25, Dec. 31 or Jan. 1. Service charges that normally accompany worker flight-pass privileges would be waived. Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said that last year, &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants were offered a $100 cash bonus for working through the holidays. Miller said the offer does not reflect a problem with holiday sick leave in the ranks of &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants. ``It\\'s just that when we\\'re in crunch time like we are around the holidays, every single person is key to our success,\\'\\' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  mrs family hospital wife children son mother home life husband medical daughter father child heart condition center died surgery woman &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.609962531058814  \\n   Loma Linda Medical Center said Friday has accepted a fourth baby born with most of his brain missing and will keep it alive for up to a week in hopes that its organs can be used for transplant. The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified Southern California &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; Thursday and transferred to Loma Linda University Medical Center, said Anita Rockwell, a spokeswoman for the center. Baby D suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is missing. The &lt;b&gt; condition &lt;/b&gt; almost always leads to death within days or weeks. ``His parents want to donate their baby\\'s organs when brain death occurs,\\'\\' Rockwell said. Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda chief of neonatology, said Baby D was resting comfortably Friday and receiving nutrition and water as needed. Rockwell said the newborn will be cared for for a seven-day period that began Thursday night. Under Loma Linda policy, Baby D will be placed on &lt;b&gt; life &lt;/b&gt; support if needed to prevent damage to organs. If Baby D is declared brain-dead within seven days, the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; will give notice that his organs are available for transplant. If he isn\\'t brain dead within seven days, he will be allowed to die. The time limit was developed to alleviate ethical concerns that doomed anencephalics not be kept alive indefinitely merely so their organs can be donated. Rockwell said anonymity was requested by Baby D\\'s parents and officials of the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; where he was born. Baby D is the fourth anencephalic newborn accepted as a possible organ donor at the hospital. The first was stillborn Dec. 23, thwarting her parents\\' desire to have her major organs donated. Her corneas and &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; valves were given to infants needing them. The second anencephalic was declared brain-dead Feb. 18. Attempts to donate his liver failed because potential recipients either weren\\'t suitable matches or couldn\\'t be operated on in time. He was disconnected from life-support Feb. 20. Most recently, a girl was transferred to Loma Linda after birth Feb. 20. Because she never met brain-death criteria within the seven-day limit, she was disconnected from a respirator and allowed to die on Feb. 28. However, her eyes, corneas and &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; valves were later donated to infants needing organs. Loma Linda gained worldwide attention in 1984 when Dr. Leonard Bailey, frustrated at the lack of &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; donors for babies, transplanted a baboon\\'s &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; into a girl known as Baby Fae. She &lt;b&gt; died &lt;/b&gt; 20{ days later. Bailey, whose baboon transplant was sharply criticized by many doctors, subsequently urged the use of anencephalics as donors of hearts and other organs. &lt;/p&gt; 0.53641965260323  \\n   Police on Friday sought a 12-year-old girl needing &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; surgery &lt;/b&gt; and her mother, who authorities said abducted the girl from a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; because the woman\\'s religion forbids blood transfusions. The girl, Kimberly Winfield, was believed to have left Children\\'s Memorial Hospital about 1 a.m. Thursday, said police Lt. Edmund Beazley. The mother, Caroline Winfield, called relatives to say she wanted to return her daughter, said Dave Schneidman, spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. But she was afraid to surrender for fear of being prosecuted. Police obtained an arrest warrant for the 35-year-old &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; on a charge of &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; abduction because Kimberly is a ward of the state, Beazley said. ``We\\'re not real interested in catching the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; if she doesn\\'t want to be caught, but we do want the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; back so we can save the child\\'s life,\\'\\' Schneidman said. Police and the state Department of Children and Family Services said they were reasonably certain the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; was responsible for the child\\'s disappearance. ``There doesn\\'t seem to be any doubt of it right now,\\'\\' Beazley said. ``Before the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; was discovered missing, the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; had told relatives that she was going to take the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; from the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; because she did not approve of the surgery,\\'\\' said department spokesman Schneidman. Schneidman said the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; needed open-heart &lt;b&gt; surgery &lt;/b&gt; to survive. ``The prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live without the surgery,\\'\\' he said. However, Children\\'s Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Jan Benzies said Kimberly, who was admitted Wednesday, was not critically ill. ``She was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; problem,\\'\\' the spokeswoman said. ``Her doctor does not believe her &lt;b&gt; life &lt;/b&gt; is in immediate danger. ``However, it is clinically advisable that she be located and treated within a month,\\'\\' she said. No one at the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; saw the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; leave, Beazley said. ``Apparently, she just got her dressed and walked out,\\'\\' he said. ``They were allowing the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; to stay in the room with her, which is pretty common with young children. The nurse came back to check on them and they were both gone.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; is a Jehovah\\'s Witness, Beazley said. Jehovah\\'s Witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against the teachings of the Bible. ``You can\\'t do &lt;b&gt; surgery &lt;/b&gt; without a transfusion of blood,\\'\\' Schneidman said. The Department of Children and Family Services waited about 34 hours after the disappearance to notify the press so police could check leads on Winfield\\'s whereabouts, Schneidman said. Those leads were exhausted, he said. The agency was named temporary custodian of Kimberly and two brothers, ages 2 and 8, about a month ago because Winfield was unable to care for them, Schneidman said. ``They were living on the streets without proper housing or any evident means of support,\\'\\' Schneidman said. The boys, whose names were not released, are now living with their paternal grandmother in Chicago, Beazley said. A department caseworker noticed Kimberly was ill and took her to the hospital, Schneidman said. Larry Winfield, Kimberly\\'s father, had been notified and was very concerned, Schneidman said. He maintains a permanent residence and is employed, but the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; have not lived with him for some time, Schneidman said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.451325934329735  \\n   Do all things get cheaper by the dozen _ even children? Things are starting out that way for Vicki and Stephen Kesler. Valley View Hospital, where Mrs. Kesler had delivered six of her most recent children, provided its services free when she went there for her 12th. The child, Breanne Marie, was born in July. ``I thought it would be nice to do something for them because they had supported us so much over the years by having their &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; here,\\'\\' said John Johnson, the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; administrator. Betty Mahan, a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; spokeswoman, said Saturday she did not know how much the free services were worth. The couple have lived in Rifle, in western Colorado, for 10 years. He is an engineer and she is a homemaker. Mrs. Kesler said that anytime she has to fill out a form that asks about her employment, she writes, ``The Kesler home, as &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; of 12. That should be sufficient.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; range to age 19. &lt;/p&gt; 0.440049487043078  \\n   Dennis Day, the Irish tenor of radio and television fame, was sent &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; Monday from St. John\\'s Hospital and Health Center, although he remains in critical condition, a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; spokesman said. ``According to his physician, he was discharged because his care can be continued in a &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; setting,\\'\\' said Armen Markarian, a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; spokesman. ``He\\'s surrounded by his &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; there, and he\\'ll be more comfortable in a &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; setting.\\'\\' Day was admitted to Saint John\\'s on June 5, and continues to suffer from a recurrence of pressure on the brain, publicist Kitty Davis said. The 71-year-old singer was diagnosed last summer as suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressively degenerative nerve disorder also known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease. On March 9, Day suffered a head injury in a fall at his Bel Air home, and underwent emergency treatment to relieve the pressure caused by bleeding in the brain. He remained in the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; until April 12, Markarian said. Day appeared regularly with comedian Jack Benny on radio and television as well as in films. Born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York, he assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny\\'s radio show as a singer in 1939 and quickly grew into a comic foil for the host. &lt;/p&gt; 0.385973013595312  \\n   When Ron Thompson sat down for lunch on New Year\\'s Eve, he was the grandfather of five. At breakfast Monday, he was a grandfather of nine. Three of Thompson\\'s daughters _ Mary Tolson, Joan Thompson and Carol Thompson _ gave birth to four boys at Seton Medical Center late Sunday and early Monday. When Ms. Tolson went into labor Sunday, she asked her 19-year-old sister Joan, who was in the ninth month of her pregnancy, to drive her to the hospital. After about five hours, Ms. Tolson, 28, gave birth at 2:40 p.m. to Shane Taylor Tolson, who weighed 7 pounds 9 ounces. At Ms. Tolson\\'s delivery, Dr. Chris Seeker said Joan told him, ``You will probably be seeing me, too.\\'\\' Sure enough, seven hours later Joan was hustled to Seton by sister Carol. Joan gave birth to Jeremy Andrew Thompson Armendariz at 12:01 a.m. He weighed 6 pounds 10 ounces. Carol, 24, then went into labor and gave birth to twin boys just before 3 a.m. The mothers and four boys spent New Year\\'s Day in good condition. ``This beats partying,\\'\\' Joan said. ``At least I have a (sense of) relief and not a headache.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  children housing home care homeless homes people parents rural families cities group local family city child living urban house poor &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.535725350854594  \\n   Disruptive &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; can cause &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; to drink more, a Florida State University study released Friday shows. ``I\\'m not suggesting we blame &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; for the alcoholism of their parents, because those who grow up in alcoholic &lt;b&gt; homes &lt;/b&gt; have suffered enough already,\\'\\' said Dr. Alan Lang, an associate professor of psychology at Florida State. ``Nonetheless, particularly difficult &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; can cause distress for &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; and, in some cases, this may contribute to increased alcohol use.\\'\\' Contrary to the teachings of self-help groups, who place the onus on &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; and tell &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; of alcoholics they aren\\'t to blame, the Florida State study may provide the first documented evidence that &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; actually can cause their &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; to drink more. Lang teamed with Dr. William Pelham of the University of Pittsburgh to conduct the research. ``Our studies show how the destructive role of alcohol in parent-child interactions is a two-way street,\\'\\' Lang said. ``Problem drinkers make &lt;b&gt; poor &lt;/b&gt; parents, but problem &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; may also drive &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; to drink.\\'\\' He said the findings are similar to those of studies that show &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; who are mentally retarded or have serious behavioral problems are abused more often than normal, obedient children. ``The point is that while we usually think of &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; as influencers of children, &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; can affect &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; as well,\\'\\' Lang said. ``And the outcome is not always favorable.\\'\\' Dr. Robin Room, scientific director of the Alchohol Research Group of the Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, wasn\\'t surprised by the findings but said it was important to look into the cause of drinking among parents, ``rather than give in to the bumper sticker-type humor that says &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; cause their &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; to drink. ``It\\'s important to understand that parental drinking patterns can later influence their children\\'s drinking patterns,\\'\\' Room said. The Florida researchers, under a grant from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked 120 &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; with 5-to-12-year-old sons to interact with an unfamiliar boy of a similar age. The &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; were then given an opportunity to drink as much or as little alcohol as they wanted, while anticipating a second interaction with the same child. Half of the &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; in the study had difficult &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; of their own with short attention spans, hyperactivity, conduct disorders, or some combination of the three. The other half had only &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; without behavior disorders. But the researchers stacked the deck. Half the &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; had initially interacted with boys who behaved normally, while half had faced boys trained by the researchers to behave in an overactive and disruptive way. Among &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; of normal children, those who interacted with disruptive boys drank one-third more than those who interacted with a cooperative child. ``I feel justified in suggesting that these results indicate that drinking is a parental behavior that can be influenced by the characteristics and behaviors of children,\\'\\' Lang said. Parents with disruptive &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; at &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; responded differently to the study, however, depending on the drinking patterns of their own parents. Those who had a &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; history of drinking problems drank 50 percent more after interacting with a deviant child-actor, while those with no such &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; history drank less. ``This suggests that &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; differ in their vulnerability to increased drinking in response to the stress of interactions with a difficult child,\\'\\' Lang said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.488623675412384  \\n   Overweight &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; have greater long-term success controlling their weight if their &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; provide early support for exercising and eating right, researchers said. Ten years after participating in a weight-loss program as 6- to 12-year-olds, &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; whose &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; got similar weight-control training were significantly less obese than those whose &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; received less training, according to a study published in Wednesday\\'s Journal of the American Medical Association. ``We think the important finding is in the modeling,\\'\\' said psychologist Leonard H. Epstein, head of the University of Pittsburgh\\'s Childhood Obesity Clinic and leader of the research team. ``If you have &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; who you don\\'t want to eat potato chips, you can\\'t sit in front of them eating Ho-Hos.\\'\\' Epstein\\'s &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; also concluded that pre-adolescent weight loss had no effect on height development, contrary to the findings of several shorter-term studies. Two other childhood obesity experts called Epstein\\'s results surprisin because previous research has shown that fat &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; will grow into fat adults and that weight lost in treatment programs is quickly regained. Those experts said further study was needed on whether treatment of obesity in childhood can produce effects that persist into young adulthood. In Epstein\\'s project, an initial &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; of 75 obese &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; and their &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; were randomly assigned to three groups. Study criteria required the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; be more than 20 percent over ideal weight for their age, height and sex; both &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; at home, one of whom had to be obese; and one parent willing to attend treatment meetings with their child. All subjects were to attend eight weekly treatment meetings followed by six monthly meetings, then by 21-month, five-year and 10-year meetings. All were instructed to follow a regimen that included a 1,200-to-1,500-calorie-per-day diet and an aerobic exercise program. In the first group, both &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; received reinforcement for losing weight and were trained to praise other &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; members for changing eating and exercise habits. In the second group, only the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; received reinforcement for losing weight but were similarly trained to praise &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; members for weight-control behaviors. Parents and &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; in the third &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; received reinforcement only for attending the meetings. They received information about social reinforcement without specific training in how to use the method. All subjects lost weight initially. At the 10-year mark, the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; in the first &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; were, on average, 7.5 percent less overweight than at the beginning of the study while those in the second and third groups were 4.5 percent and 14.3 percent fatter, respectively. Parents in all three groups were more obese after 10 years than at the start of the study. In a journal editorial, Dr. Albert J. Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania medical school and Dr. Robert I. Berkowitz of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic cautioned that the ``treatment did not prevent obesity, it limited it.\\'\\' They called Epstein\\'s results surprising, perhaps because of his relatively small study sample: intact, middle-class &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; in which the &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; were likely to be very supportive of their children\\'s efforts. They said replication of Epstein\\'s study ``is clearly needed\\'\\' before the findings can be embraced. &lt;/p&gt; 0.444631427012752  \\n   Amid the frozen farm fields of Iowa, Judy Shelly answered a cry for help from a small wooden garage. Huddled inside were a mother and three children. They\\'d lost almost everything _ including their home. They had blankets, beds, a few sticks of furniture and a hot plate, but no bathroom or refrigerator. No money either. Forced off their farm, abandoned by husband and father, the &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; was struggling to survive. Their predicament is a sad but increasingly common sign of hard times in the heartland. As farmers lose their land, small-town factories shut their doors and &lt;b&gt; housing &lt;/b&gt; costs rise, growing numbers of &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; folks are joining the ranks of the nation\\'s homeless. ``Rural &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are everywhere around us,\\'\\' said Louisa Stark, president of the National Coalition for the Homeless. ``They\\'re &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in barns and chicken coops. They\\'re doubled and tripled up with &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; and friends. They\\'re &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; under trees or, in some cases, sleeping in caves.\\'\\' Garages, too. The Iowa &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; had rented a nearby &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; after losing their farm last winter, but when the pipes burst and the landlord couldn\\'t afford repairs, they moved into the garage because it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater. Shelly, who works for a farmers-assistance group, helped find them a place to stay. They moved on shortly after. People think &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; America ``has been able to stand on its own two feet ever since the Depression,\\'\\' Shelly said. ``(They think) somehow they\\'ll get by. They think you have the white picket fence, mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids. That\\'s not the way it is. ``The reality is &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; life and &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; life are not much different anymore,\\'\\' she added. ``We have &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; going without food. We have &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; going without heat.\\'\\' And &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; going without roofs over their heads. Up to 3 million Americans are homeless, the national coalition says. Some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; areas, but nobody knows for sure because they aren\\'t as conspicious as &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; panhandling on &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; streets or sleeping on grates. ``Everybody calls the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; invisible. In fact, they are,\\'\\' said Melanie Roth of the Housing Assistance Council in Washington, D.C., which deals with &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; low-income &lt;b&gt; housing &lt;/b&gt; needs. ``They don\\'t wander the streets of small-town America,\\'\\' said Keith Luebke, co-director of the Welcome Inn Transitional Living Center in Mankato, Minn. ``They leave or they somehow hide themselves or hide their problems. They don\\'t want anyone to know.\\'\\' Most of the newest &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; are working &lt;b&gt; poor &lt;/b&gt; and farm families, says a report by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences. Compared with their &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; counterparts, the report says, they\\'re younger &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; dependent on two incomes; typically, one wage-earner loses a job and the remaining income isn\\'t enough to pay the rent. They most often live in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled industries. These &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; face a Hobson\\'s choice of moving in with friends or relatives _ or pulling up roots and leaving. The institute\\'s report said some &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; areas have a five-year waiting list for public housing. Though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities, the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; get much less help _ fewer shelters, fewer soup kitchens, less money from charities. ``In short, the faint voice that has recently been given to the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; America has been denied the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; America,\\'\\' said a national coalition study on such problems in Appalachia and the South. Several studies have examined &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; homelessness. Among the findings: _ More than three-quarters of community agencies responding to a Housing Assistance Council survey last year reported increases in &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; from 1981-82 to 1986-87. Of those, 38 percent said the increase was significant. _ In Ohio, the proportion of women among the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; was twice that of &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; populations, according to a 1985 study. That\\'s partly due to the higher percentage of married &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; among the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; homeless, 18.5 percent against 6.7 percent married among &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; homeless. _ In Minnesota, 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; centers had jobs, compared with 24 percent in &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; Minneapolis, said a 1988 study by the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless. _ In Iowa, a study found one of the larger groups in danger of losing &lt;b&gt; homes &lt;/b&gt; was farm widows, many of whom live on just a few hundred dollars a month. The count of &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; should also include &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; who live in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family, a common arrangement among down-and-out farmers, the experts say. It may be 21 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in one house, nine &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; and three adults squeezed in a trailer or a &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; so crowded they sleep in shifts. ``You have &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; on top of each other. Those are the hidden homeless,\\'\\' said Luebke. ``These &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; no longer have their own &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; or apartment. They have a roof over their head, but in real terms they should be considered homeless.\\'\\' Living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies say it\\'s tantamount to being homeless. ``When &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have a &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; where the roof is constantly leaking and the cold air can come in ... (and) there\\'s no money to fix those things, that\\'s not a home,\\'\\' said Norma Dell, director of Bethany House, a Kentucky social service center. Agencies around the country have files on &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in rat-infested shanties, rotting houses without walls or shacks without heat, water or toilets. Others describe a wheelchair-bound man &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; under a bridge after being evicted, an Indian &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough, a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator. Stark said she\\'s heard reports from California of farmworkers &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves. &lt;/p&gt; 0.408340774464199  \\n   Frustration over having to draw up an unemotional report on the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; and then go into streets where &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were ``ravaging garbage cans\\'\\' prompted dissent by most of the report\\'s authors, one of them said today. Phyllis Wolfe, executive director of a private health &lt;b&gt; care &lt;/b&gt; program for the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; in the nation\\'s capital, said that while gathering information for the report, panel members became outraged at conditions they found. ``It could just not be left in dots and dashes and graphs and figures,\\'\\' Ms. Wolfe said on ``CBS This Morning.\\'\\' Ms. Wolfe joined eight other members of the committee formed by the National Academy of Sciences\\' Institute of Medicine in issuing a supplementary statement that the institute refused to include in its report published Monday. The published report, ``Homelessness, Health and Human Needs,\\'\\' calls the growing number of &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; ``a national disgrace.\\'\\' It recommends such measures as changing food stamp programs, increasing Medicaid services and expanding programs that help pre-school children. The authors of the supplementary statement said recommendations in the report were too limited. They said the country should supply more low-income housing, raise the minimum wage, offer more support services and guarantee &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; adequate health care. Nine members of the 13-member panel signed the supplementary statement saying the main study ``fails to capture our sense of shame and anger about homelessness.\\'\\' The original report estimates that &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; with a total of 100,000 &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; are &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; on any given night, in addition to countless &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; who have run away from &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; or been kicked out by their parents. It says those under 18 are the fastest growing &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; group, and homelessness is increasing in many &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; areas as well as in the nation\\'s cities. Ms. Wolfe said the committee\\'s work on the report was ``very structured,\\'\\' but members found themselves ``leaving committee meetings and walking by and seeing &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; ravaging garbage cans, seeing &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; suffering on the street.\\'\\' The supplementary statement itself expresses the same sentiment: ``We have reviewed the demographic and clinical data and then, walking home, passed men asleep on heating grates or displaced &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; energetically searching in garbage piles for a few cents\\' income from aluminum cans,\\'\\' it says. ``We analyzed mortality data for the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; but lacked any platform from which to shout that our neighbors are dying needlessly because we are incapable of providing the most basic services.\\'\\' ``We can no longer sit as spectators to the elderly &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; dying of hypothermia, to the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; with blighted futures poisoned by lead in rat-infested dilapidated welfare hotels, to women raped, to old men beaten and robbed of their few possessions, and to pepole dying on the streets with catastrophic illness such as AIDS,\\'\\' the supplementary report said. It said the committee members who dissented against the report\\'s limited nature endorsed its long list of recommendations, but ``felt continuously uneasy because of our inability to state the most basic recommendation: homelessness in the United States is an inexcusable disgrace and must be eliminated.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.394652789863667  \\n   Hours after three &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were evicted from one boarded-up &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, they moved into another unoccupied HUD house, officials said. The three are members of the Union for the Homeless, and HUD spokesman Ken Barnard accused them of seeking publicity. Police evicted Clotilde Lewis, 36, Duwayne Jackson, 39, and Floretta Logan, 27, from the first &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday afternoon. Homeless Union members had helped them break into the &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; on Saturday. Lewis was handcuffed and taken to a police station when she refused to leave the first &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; but was released without being charged. Barnard said the three were trespassing in a &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; bought by a &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; that planned to move in later in the week. Hours after their eviction, the three settled into a boarded-up four-bedroom &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; with three kerosene heaters, clothes and hamburgers from a fast-food restaurant. They remained there early today while officials considered whether to arrest them and file trespassing charges, said William Harris, deputy director of the Detroit HUD office. Wayne Pippin, president of the Union for the Homeless, said after the eviction Tuesday that HUD owns many vacant &lt;b&gt; homes &lt;/b&gt; and ``should be ashamed to kick someone out of this home, which is needed so badly.\\'\\' Jackson, unemployed after working at odd jobs, said &lt;b&gt; housing &lt;/b&gt; is difficult to find on $150 a month from public assistance. ``This is a major emergency situation,\\'\\' said Sally Pattee, a &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; spokeswoman. ``The temporary shelters have been full since July. When &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; need temporary shelter, they need it now.\\'\\' Barnard said HUD makes its properties available to the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; through organizations such as the Detroit Non-profit Housing Coalition. HUD obtains houses when buyers default on government-backed mortgages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  court case judge ruling supreme state appeals decision lawyers federal ruled rights appeal cases order legal law civil lawyer courts &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.712545268792383  \\n   The Supreme Court today let stand a $3.5 million punitive-damages award won by a San Diego gas station operator against Atlantic Richfield Co. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the second largest of its kind ever upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. John V. Nielsen had operated an ARCO station as an independent dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station to a mini-market and self-service station in 1979. His lawsuit charged ARCO with fraudulently misrepresenting facts in connection with the conversion of his station. A &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; jury awarded Nielsen $525,788 in compensatory damages _ $79,061 in out-of-pocket losses, $396,727 in lost anticipated profits and $50,000 for emotional distress. The jury also awarded him $3.5 million in punitive damages against ARCO. A &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; upheld the award except for the emotional-distress damages, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear ARCO\\'s appeal. In the &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; acted on today, &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; for ARCO argued that the huge punitive-damages award _ seven times the compensatory-damages award _ violates the Eighth Amendment\\'s ban on ``excessive fines.\\'\\' No &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; has ever applied that constitutional principle to non-criminal cases. The Supreme Court in May passed up deciding in a Mississippi &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; whether the constitutional ban on ``excessive fines\\'\\' can be applied to personal-injury lawsuits. Some &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury lawsuits. Lawyers for ARCO urged the justices to ``send a clear signal that the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; courts &lt;/b&gt; must stop these gargantuan awards.\\'\\' But &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; for Nielsen argued that the ARCO &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; should not be granted because the oil company\\'s &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; had not raised the ``excessive fines\\'\\' argument in &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; courts. The justices refused to address the punitive-damages issue in the Mississippi &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; decided earlier this month after noting that it had not been raised in &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; courts. ARCO\\'s &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; did not challenge the $475,000 compensatory-damages award won by Nielsen. The &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; is Atlantic Richfield vs. Nielsen, 87-1196. &lt;/p&gt; 0.54935381321369  \\n   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a $550,000 award won, and then lost, by a Texas couple whose daughter was born with deformities after her mother took the anti-nausea drug Bendectin. The justices, without comment, let stand a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; that overturned a jury award against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the drug\\'s manufacturer. Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Brock of Moscow, Texas, sued Merrell Dow after their daughter, Rachel, was born with deformed limbs in 1982. A three-member panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out the $550,000 judgment a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; trial jury had awarded the Brocks. The &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said there is no definitive scientific proof that Bendectin causes birth defects, and said the jury award was based on speculation. ``Speculation unconfirmed by ... proof cannot form the basis for causation in a &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; of law,\\'\\' the &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said. The full 5th Circuit court, by a 8-6 vote, refused to review the three-member panel\\'s ruling. The dissenters noted that six experts testified for the Brocks that Bendectin is capable of causing birth defects, and that three testified they believed the drug caused Rachel\\'s deformities. The dissenting judges said appellate &lt;b&gt; courts &lt;/b&gt; should not substitute their understanding of the facts for that of a jury merely because medical experts disagree. Bendectin was marketed by Richardson-Merrell Inc. between 1957 and 1983. More than 30 million women used the drug during pregnancy. Richardson-Merrell later became Merrell Dow, which last July merged with Marion Laboratories Inc. and became Marion Merrell Dow Inc., based in Kansas City. The company stopped selling Bendectin 1983, although the Federal Drug Administration never has rescinded approval of it. Merrell Dow in 1984 agreed to pay $120 million to more than 800 families to compensate children with birth defects allegedly caused by Bendectin. As part of the settlement, the corporation did not admit that the drug caused the defects. The settlement was rejected by a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; court, and the lawsuits then went to a consolidated trial in Ohio, where Merrell Dow has its headquarters in Hamilton County. After a 22-day trial in 1985, an Ohio jury found that Bendectin did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses. The &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; acted on today is Brock vs. Merrell Dow, 89-1189. &lt;/p&gt; 0.525270540212575  \\n   California\\'s &lt;b&gt; civil &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; commission may not award damages for emotional distress or other personal harm caused by job discrimination, the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Supreme Court &lt;b&gt; ruled &lt;/b&gt; today. The 5-2 &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; eliminates the Fair Employment and Housing Commission\\'s ability to &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; damages for bias victims who commonly suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation caused by employers\\' mistreatment. Those victims of sexual or racial harassment could still go to &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; and sue for a full range of damages. But suits are available only to those who can afford a lawyer. The &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said the commission was authorized only to &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; back pay and reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require employers to take steps to prevent future discrimination. In a separate &lt;b&gt; decision &lt;/b&gt; today, the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said discrimination victims were not required to file claims with the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; before suing in court. The rulings come three years after the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; prohibited the same commission from awarding punitive damages in flagrant &lt;b&gt; cases &lt;/b&gt; of job discrimination. In that time, the Legislature has passed bills establishing the commission\\'s authority to award both kinds of damages, but Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed them. Today\\'s &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; was based on an interpretation of current &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; law &lt;/b&gt; and left open the possibility that the Legislature could pass a new &lt;b&gt; law &lt;/b&gt; allowing the commission to award damages. But the opinion by Justice Edward Panelli hinted that unlimited damage awards by the commission, even if authorized by &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; law, might be found unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a jury trial. A jury in a &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; ``is in the best position to determine just compensation for emotional and mental distress,\\'\\' Panelli wrote. The &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; overturned a $20,000 damage award by the commission to Rose Brown, a secretary for the Peralta Community College District in Oakland. She claimed she was fired in April 1981 for refusing sexual advances by an administrator at Laney College. &lt;/p&gt; 0.515448070132596  \\n   The Supreme Court today strengthened the right of criminal suspects to have &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; present when they are questioned by police. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned the murder conviction of Mississippi death row inmate Robert S. Minnick, who confessed when he was questioned without his &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; present. The &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said Minnick\\'s &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; were violated even though he earlier had consulted with his &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; and agreed to talk to authorities. Unless the suspect initiates such a talk with police, the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said, he may not be questioned outside the presence of his &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; once he has invoked his right to a lawyer. In other action, the court: - Left intact a lawsuit settlement that eased restrictions on abortion clinics in Illinois. The court, without comment, rejected an &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; by two nurses and two expectant fathers who said the settlement does not adequately protect women or fetuses. - Refused to kill a lawsuit against a California community college\\'s officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the on-campus performance of a racially charged play. The court, without comment, rejected an &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; by the college officials. - Shielded businesses from some big-money lawsuits filed by employees who claim they were fired so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits. The &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; ruled &lt;/b&gt; unanimously that fired employees may not sue4 in &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; courts &lt;/b&gt; over such allegations. The &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; suits are pre-empted by a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; law &lt;/b&gt; protecting pensions, the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; in the confession case, said, ``There can be no doubt that the interrogation in question was initiated by the police. It was a formal interview which (Minnick) was compelled to attend.\\'\\' ``Since (Minnick) made a specific request for counsel before the interview, the police-initiated interrogation was impermissible.\\'\\' In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority was ``misguided\\'\\' to discourage ``an honest confession.\\'\\' He said the &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; undermines a ``belief in either personal responsibility or the moral claim of just government to obedience.\\'\\' He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case. Minnick and James ``Monkey\\'\\' Dyess escaped from Clarke County, Miss., jail in April 1986 and went looking for guns, authorities said. Police said the two men fatally shot Donald Ellis Thomas and Lamar Lafferty when the victims returned to Thomas\\'s mobile home to find Minnick and Dyess there. Minnick was arrested in Lemon Grove, Calif., on Aug. 22, 1986. FBI agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a lawyer. Minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to answer any more questions. A few days later, Deputy Sheriff J.C. Denham of Clarke County flew to California and questioned Minnick. The suspect confessed, saying he shot Lafferty because Dyess was threatening to kill Minnick if he did not. Minnick was convicted in Mississippi and sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court, in upholding his conviction, said Denham\\'s questioning of Minnick did not violate a rule the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1981. The high &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; barred police from questioning a suspect who has asked for a &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; unless the suspect initiates the conversation. Today the high &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; extended that &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; to instances in which a suspect already has conferred with an attorney. Kennedy said the 1981 &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; is designed to prevent police from badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; provided by the court\\'s famous Miranda &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; in 1966. The threat of badgering is no less after the suspect has talked to his lawyer, Kennedy said. ``A single consultation with an attorney does not remove the suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to waive his &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; or from the coercive pressures that accompany custody and that may increase as custody is prolonged,\\'\\' he said. The &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; is Minnick vs. Mississippi, 89-6332. &lt;/p&gt; 0.509516901330661  \\n   The Supreme Court today reinstated a $6.1 million award against the Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting firm won by investors in the Farmer\\'s Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The justices, by a 5-4 vote, &lt;b&gt; ruled &lt;/b&gt; that the promissory notes held by the co-op\\'s investors are ``securities\\'\\' as defined by &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; law. A &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; had thrown out the award after &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; that the notes were not securities. Sold for many years by the co-op to thousands of farmers, the notes were uninsured, payable on demand and yielded only interest. When the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984, about 1,600 of its 23,000 members held notes they had purchased for more than $10 million. Among other &lt;b&gt; legal &lt;/b&gt; actions, investors filed a ``class action\\'\\' lawsuit against Arthur Young &amp; Co., which had audited the co-op\\'s 1981 and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those statements. The suit alleged that the accounting firm fraudulently had misled investors about the co-op\\'s financial strength, in violation of a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; security law\\'s anti-fraud provisions. A &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; jury awarded the investors about $6.1 million in compensatory damages, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award when &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; that the notes were not securities. In disagreeing with the 8th Circuit court, Justice Thurgood Marshall noted ``Congress\\' broader purpose ... of ensuring that investments of all descriptions be regulated to prevent fraud and abuse.\\'\\' He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O\\'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented.

The &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; seized in Monday\\'s operation near Colombia\\'s northern coast was hidden among cargo bags and ready to be exported to the United States, said regional army commander Col. Carlos Castro. He said troops destroyed six cocaine-processing laboratories, &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; 103 suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers and found nearly 5,000 acres of coca leaf, the raw material used to make cocaine. Soldiers also seized 30 vehicles, all with Venezuelan license plates, which had been used to transport drugs, Castro said. Also confiscated were cocaine- processing chemicals and a cache of weapons, he said. The bust was considered one of the year\\'s most important. So far in 1990 security forces have confiscated about 45 tons of cocaine, compared to 33 tons in all of 1989. Colombia\\'s Medellin and Cali &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; cartels supply most of the &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; consumed in the United States. The coca leaf is mostly grown in Bolivia and Peru, then processed in Colombia. The Medellin cartel has been blamed for a long series of terrorist attacks in which at least 550 people have died in the past 14 months. &lt;/p&gt; 0.501531081379748  \\n   Two suspected Colombian &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers were extradited to the United States on Tuesday, the first such extraditions since President Cesar Gaviria took office last month. Jose Hilario Ortiz and Raul Hernan Buchelli, who both face &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; charges in the United States, were placed on board a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane bound for Miami, national police chief Gen. Miguel Gomez said in remarks broadcast by the RCN radio network. Ortiz faces &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; charges in Connecticut and Buchelli is wanted in Florida, said a police spokesman, requesting anonymity. No further details were immediately available. Buchelli is wanted on charges of conspiracy to smuggle and distribute heroin and money laundering, while Ortiz pleaded guilty to a &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; conspiracy charge and fled the country before sentencing, according to U.S. court records. Buchelli\\'s brother, Guido Lucio, also faces &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; charges in the United States. But he was released last week after the government rejected a U.S. request for his extradition, citing insufficient evidence. Colombia has extradited 24 suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers to the United States since August 1989, when the government launched a major anti-drug crackdown after the murder of a presidential candidate. Twelve of those extradited have either been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty; one was acquitted. An additional nine are awaiting trial. The crackdown prompted the Medellin &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; cartel to declare ``total war\\'\\' on the government a year ago. Tuesday\\'s extraditions were the first of suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers to the United States since Gaviria was inaugurated Aug. 7. He has pledged to continue the war against the &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; cartels waged by his predecessor, Virgilio Barco. Last Wednesday, Gaviria modified the country\\'s extradition policy. In a nationally televised speech, Gaviria said &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers who turn themselves in and confess their crimes would be tried in Colombia and not face extradition to the United States. Under the decree announced by Gaviria, Colombian judges would be also empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess and cooperate with local investigations. The country\\'s &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; barons have so far offered no reply to Gaviria\\'s offer. Gaviria\\'s offer appeared to be, at least in part, a response to repeated offers from the &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers to surrender to Colombian judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had been resumed last year by Barco. The &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers have feared extradition to the United States because they would have little influence over the judicial process there. Cocaine cartel members have traditionally been able to either bribe or threaten their way out of Colombian jails. Judges who refuse to be intimidated have often been slain. In his speech last week, Gaviria announced that three Colombians would soon be extradited to the United States, but he said three other U.S. extradition requests had been turned down. The third suspect set to be extradited, Joaquin Oswaldo Gallo Chamorro, was still being held in Colombia on Tuesday. Authorities did not say why he was not sent to the United States with Ortiz and Buchelli. With the latest extraditions, the U.S. Justice Department is still seeking to extradite 14 suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers held in Colombia. Colombia\\'s Cali and Medellin &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; cartels supply most of the &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; consumed in the United States and Europe. Authorities blame the Medellin for killing about 550 Colombians the past year, including three presidential candidates. &lt;/p&gt; 0.440929319990765  \\n   U.S. Postal inspectors &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; 10 employees for &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; through the Dallas Main Post Office Tuesday night, following a nine-month undercover investigation. Postal Inspector Jim Travell said &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; are still looking for two more employees who were indicted for selling and distributing marijuana and &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; at the postal processing center. ``The indictments were handed down by a Dallas grand jury and charged each postal worker with selling &lt;b&gt; drugs &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; agents &lt;/b&gt; who worked in an undercover capacity at the facility,\\'\\' said Travell, of Fort Worth. Sealed indictments were handed down April 28, Travell said, but they were not unsealed until Tuesday to allow &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; time to organize the arrests. Those &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; are mail handlers or processors and distribution clerks who worked two evening shifts processing mail through the Dallas facility, Travell said. ``They worked different shifts and we have no reason to believe there was a conspiracy between them,\\'\\' Travell said. The employees, who have one to 10 years experience with the postal service, were &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; for selling between a quarter-ounce to several pounds of marijuana or between a half-gram to a quarter-ounce of &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; in any one sale to the undercover officers, Travell said. ``The largest sale we did was $1,000,\\'\\' Travell said. ``Most of them ranged from $25 to $1,000 a sale. The jist of the investigation was dealers, not users.\\'\\' Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Webster of Dallas said the employees face pentalties of 5 years to 15 years in prison and fines of $150,000 to $200,000. Travell said inspectors were alerted to a &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; problem among the 4,000 workers at the facility by employees. ``Fellow employees are starting to be fed-up with this type of behavior,\\'\\' Travell said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.440077480020122  \\n   The prosecutor responsible for convicting reputed &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas says the powerful Medellin Cartel\\'s days are now numbered, but a defense lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned. Lehder was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons of &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; into the United States. Authorities say the 38-year-old Colombian was a key figure in the cartel, a violent &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; ring responsible for about 80 percent of U.S. &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; imports. The flamboyant Lehder, described by witnesses as a one-time New York City street hood, was characterized by U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, chief prosecutor in the case, as the most important &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; smuggler brought to trial in the United States. The verdict capped a seven-month trial on an 11-count federal indictment charging him with taking over the island of Norman\\'s Cay in the Bahamas to smuggle &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; into Florida and Georgia from 1978 to 1980. &lt;/p&gt; 0.399653013529052  \\n   Police said Monday they have &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; a man in Hong Kong in connection with the seizure of 143 pounds of heroin concealed in cans of Chinese fruit imported to Los Angeles. The man was &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; Saturday after U.S. &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; discovered the high-grade heroin hidden in 192 cans of litchis in syrup found in Los Angeles last month, police said. The &lt;b&gt; drugs &lt;/b&gt; would have sold for about $64 million in the United States, the statement said. Officers of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs also &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; two men _ a Chinese and a Vietnamese _ in Alhambra, Calif., on Saturday in connection with the &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; bust, the statement said. The man in Hong Kong was &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; after police raided sites in the colony and uncovered a &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; packaging center in an industrial building, police said. No names were released and investigations into the case were continuing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  mecham office impeachment bones senate johnson governor society loan skull threat mecham\\'s public mofford steiger post senators milstead toussaint richards &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.41779643478785  \\n   Gov. Evan Mecham broke the law and lied about it to the state Senate, a prosecutor said today in urging the Senate to convict the impeached first-term Republican and remove him from office. Prosecutor William French said in closing arguments that Mecham broke the law in borrowing $80,000 from the governor\\'s protocol fund for his auto dealership. ``He has violated the law ... He has uttered untruths to you,\\'\\' French said. Earlier, prosecutor Paul Eckstein accused Mecham of showing ``a lifetime of reckless disregard for the reputation of anyne who has stood in his path to political power.\\'\\' ``Respondent (Mecham) has demonstrated for all the world to see his plain inability to tell the truth,\\' Eckstein said. ``How much proof is required to demonstrate that respondent puffed, exaggerated, misremembered, dissembled and out-and-out lied.\\'\\' Eckstein said Mecham\\'s conduct in &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; ``was not just offensive, it was grossly offensive.\\'\\' Senators must decide whether to convict Mecham on two &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; charges issued by the Arizona House. A third charge was dismissed. A vote could come late today or Tuesday, climaxing five weeks of trial, lawmakers said. A conviction would force the first-term Republican out of office. The first &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; count accuses the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; by a state official. Mecham contended he did not intend to beak the law and that he was not fully informed of the seriousness of the alleged threat. ``Ignorance of the law is no defense,\\'\\' Eckstein told senators. But Mecham\\'s defense lawyer, Fred Craft, told senators, ``You\\'re being asked to politically assassinate the governor.\\'\\' ``He doesn\\'t resign (as Mecham has been urged to) because he\\'s not guilty of these charges,\\'\\' Craft said. ``He dares to right city hall and he\\'s doing it at great cost to himself.\\'\\' Craft said in his closing argument that the allegation was based on a 90-second conversation with Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. Craft accused prosecutors of seeking to ``twist and torture it in such a way that it accounts for an obstruction of justice.\\'\\' As closing arguments proceeded, a trumpeter played ``Taps\\'\\' outside the Senate building as a group of men carried a mock coffin labeled, ``Herein Lies the Right to an Elected Governor.\\'\\' The prosecutor accused Mecham of making a number of statements during his Senate testimony that ``are either wrong\\'\\' or were contradicted by other witnesses. Among the examples cited by Eckstein was the governor\\'s testimony, recanted a day later, that his former chief bodyguard had stolen a report from the governor\\'s office. Nonetheless, Eckstein said, Mecham and Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead gave ``remarkably similar\\'\\' accounts of their Nov. 15 conversation in which Mecham allegedly ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general\\'s investigation of the alleged threat. Mecham admitted in Senate testimony that he told Milstead, ``The attorney general is out to get me and I\\'m not going to help him in any way.\\'\\' Mecham sat at the defense table during closing arguments. When he arrived at the Capitol, he was cheered by a group of well-wishers as he walked into the Senate building behind bodyguards. He said nothing but smiled and flashed a thumbs-up signal at the crowd. Mecham, 63, who took &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; in January 1987, has maintained he is innocent of wrongdoing. He also is accused of misusing $80,000 from the governor\\'s protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. Last week the Senate dismissed a third charge that Mecham concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, the subject of the governor\\'s April 21 criminal trial. Some &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; said hearing testimony on that allegation could have prejudiced his criminal trial. However, Democrats acknowledged that the real reason they favored dismissing the charge was to ensure a Senate trial verdict well before the scheduled May 17 gubernatorial recall election. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required for conviction. Lawmakers also could bar Mecham from holding any future &lt;b&gt; public &lt;/b&gt; office. If convicted, Mecham would become the seventh U.S. &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; removed from &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; by impeachment. The prosecution contends the governor\\'s protocol fund _ created with inaugural ball proceeds _ was a &lt;b&gt; public &lt;/b&gt; fund and that Mecham Pontiac needed the $80,000 &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; to meet its July 1987 payroll. However, the defense said the fund was private money and that the &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; was intended merely to provide a higher interest rate for the fund. Mecham Pontiac was in good financial shape and could have borrowed the money elsewhere, according to testimony by the governor\\'s son, Dennis, who is general manager of the dealership. But the day after he testified last week, Dennis Mecham announced the dealership was being sold. Sales had suffered due to the ``avalanche of negative publicity\\'\\' about the governor, he said. The allegation regarding the death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; has boiled down to Mecham\\'s word against that of Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. He testified that Mecham ordered him not to cooperate with the attorney general\\'s investigation of the alleged &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; by state official Lee Watkins against former top Mecham aide Donna Carlson. At the time of the alleged &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; in November, Ms. Carlson was about to testify before the state grand jury regarding the $350,000 campaign loan. Senators, meanwhile, said they knew how important the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; vote will be. If the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; is allowed to return to his job, ``I think there\\'ll be terrible chaos in state government,\\'\\' said Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat. Lawmakers\\' own careers also may hang in the balance, some &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.360770902047693  \\n   Gov. Evan Mecham should be removed from &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; for obstructing an investigation of an alleged death threat, &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; were told today during opening arguments of the first-term Republican\\'s &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial. But a defense attonrey for Mecham told &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; in an impassioned statement that Mecham was the victim of a ``mutiny\\'\\' by the state attorney general and director of the state Department of Public Safety. Prosecutor William French said the man accused of making the alleged threat, former state official Lee Watkins, had claimed that jobs in the Mecham administration ``relate to the amount of money that you were able to bring into the campaign.\\'\\' French said the evidence was ``overwhelming\\'\\' that Mecham violated criminal laws and his oath of &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and committed malfeasance in office, ``any one of which call for impeachment.\\'\\' However, defense attorney Fred Craft told &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; in his opening statement that Mecham broke no laws and was acting within his authority. ``What has this man done?\\'\\' Craft said. ``There\\'s something wrong in this state when you can depose the constitutionally elected officer of the state and throw the book at him ... based upon evidence that\\'s being presented by people who have a stake in the outcome to have him ousted.\\'\\' Craft said the accusations resulted from a ``mutiny\\'\\' by Attorney General Bob Corbin and DPS Director Ralph Milstead. The DPS includes the Highway Patrol and investigative personnel. Craft also said he would present testimony that would cast dubt on Milstead\\'s integrity. Mecham, who also faces a March 22 criminal trial and a May 17 recall election, did not appear at the Senate on the second day of his &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial. The &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; counts against Mecham include an allegation that he ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general\\'s probe of an alleged death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; by Watkins, then the state prison construction chief. ``There was an obstruction with regard to an ongoing investigation that was being conducted by the attorney general\\'s office,\\'\\' French said. Watkins has denied making a &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; against Donna Carlson, a former top Mecham aide who testified before the state grand jury on Mecham\\'s failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan. DPS Officer Frank Martinez, a former member of Mecham\\'s security detail who was called as the trial\\'s first witness, testified this morning that Mecham administration official Peggy Griffith told him about a conversation she had with Watkins. Ms. Griffith said Watkins had told her that if Ms. Carlson ``did not keep her mouth shut, she could wind up taking a long boat ride ... and I know the right people who can help me,\\'\\' Martinez testified. Martinez said that he met with Milstead, other DPS officers, Corbin and several assistant attorneys general several days later and that Milstead told of a conversation he had with Mecham. Martinez said Milstead told the group that Mecham ``stated he didn\\'t want him helping the attorney general.\\'\\' ``The overall mood was just amazement,\\'\\' Martinez testified. Craft said Milstead and other officials did not fully advise Mecham about the alleged threat, adding that Milstead ``was a feckless employee of this state and he did not serve that &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; well.\\'\\' French said Watkins complained about the job he was given by Mecham and told Corrections Director Sam Lewis, ``If they don\\'t treat me right I can bring Mecham\\'s administration down.\\'\\' French warned the Senate to ``keep your eye on the ball\\'\\' and not be distracted by any attacks on witnesses in the case. ``Know that this is being done because there is no defense,\\'\\' French said. The opening arguments today dealt only with the alleged threat. Arguments will precede discussion of the other allegations against Mecham as they are reached during the trial. On the trial\\'s opening day Monday, the Senate strongly rejected efforts to dismiss &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; charges against Mecham. Also, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule today on a defense claim that the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial, the first of a U.S. &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; in 59 years, should be delayed until after Mecham\\'s March 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. The high court last week refused to grant a temporary delay, and Mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court if necessary. Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, said ``it was the first-day jitters for everyone\\'\\' in the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial\\'s opening day Monday. ``It crosses everybody\\'s mind _ the importance to do justice to the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; and the state,\\'\\' said Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, also a Republican. ``It\\'s a large burden and we take it seriously.\\'\\' Senators refused to dismiss the 23 articles of &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; against Mecham, whose attorney, Jerris Leonard, entered an innocent plea on his behalf. On 11 separate motions, the largest number of the 29 &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; voting for dismissal was seven. Several &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; said the vote should not be considered an indication that Mecham is likely to be convicted, saying they want to hear the evidence first. However, Sen. Jeff Hill, a Republican who has strongly backed Mecham, said the governor\\'s conviction was virtually a foregone conclusion. ``I think that it\\'s not likely that he\\'s going to prevail,\\'\\' he said. If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be removed from &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and could be permanently barred from holding elective &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; in Arizona. Mecham, 63, won election in a three-way race after five tries. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and insisted he will survive both trials and a May 17 recall election and return to the &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; he gave up to acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, when he was impeached by the House on Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt; 0.342604915673256  \\n   His governorship gone, his ailing auto dealership sold, Evan Mecham faces a future in which one of the few certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial. But for Arizona, the future looks brighter without the shadow of Mecham\\'s embarrassing &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial hanging over the state, said Rose Mofford, who became &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; with Mecham\\'s removal. ``Today we have reached the end of some difficult times in Arizona,\\'\\' Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, said Monday. ``I know the decision made by the Senate today was not reached lightly. It is time to put all that behind us and move forward.\\'\\' ``Today none of us are Republicans, none of us are Democrats,\\'\\' she said. ``We are all Arizonans. Let us go forward together as Arizonans.\\'\\' The impeached first-term Republican was stripped of his &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; Monday when the Senate convicted him of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; and misusing the governor\\'s protocol fund. The end of the trial did not heal the divisions that arose during Mecham\\'s turbulent 15 months in office. Predictably, the verdict was praised by Mecham opponents and condemned by supporters. Some legislators received police protection Monday night after getting threatening phone calls that were prompted by the vote, said Department of Public Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt. ``They\\'ve been all types of intimidating-type threatening statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,\\'\\' Schmidt said. Mecham\\'s future troubles could include a maximum 22-year prison sentence if he is convicted on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. He faces trial April 21 in Maricopa County Superior Court on six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents. His brother Willard, who was his 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. The Senate threw out an &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; count based on the $350,000 &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; issue. Although the Senate did not bar Mecham from holding &lt;b&gt; public &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; again, his lawyer, Jerris Leonard, indicated after the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; vote that Mecham may decide to bow out of politics. ``I think there is doubt,\\'\\' he said of whether Mecham would try to appeal his case to voters in a recall election May 17. It was not clear whether the ousted &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; could remain on the recall ballot given him &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; conviction. The matter probably will be decided by the courts, said Attorney General Bob Corbin. Leonard said, ``I think the decision of where we go from now is dependent on whether or not the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; himself wants to stay in politics and that\\'s something that he\\'s got to decide overnight.\\'\\' After Monday\\'s conviction, Mecham left the Senate chamber smiling. Asked what he planned next, he said, ``We\\'ll decide tomorrow or the next day ... We\\'re keeping all our options open.\\'\\' After he was impeached by the House of Representatives on Feb. 5, the 63-year-old Mecham hinted he might give up politics. ``If I can be of service, fine,\\'\\' he said. ``If not, I\\'d enjoy private life. The best person doesn\\'t always win. Politics is not my favorite pastime.\\'\\' Mecham ran for &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; five times before being elected in 1986. Although Mecham\\'s son, Dennis, testified last week that their Mecham Pontiac dealership in suburban Glendale was thriving, he announced a day later that they\\'d been forced to sell it for $4 million because of dwindling sales. Dennis Mecham said bad publicity surrounding his father\\'s political battles had driven customers away. The dealership was sold last week. &lt;/p&gt; 0.339381693729968  \\n   Skull and Bones, the oldest and most secret senior &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; at Yale University, boasts many distinguished alumni but none more prominent today than a ``spook\\'\\' from the class of 1948 _ George Herbert Walker Bush. Little is known about the strange rituals and practices of the 156-year-old society, and that\\'s the way its members want it. The rites are rumored to include placing initiates in a coffin and requiring them to plunge naked into a pile of mud. Some of the rumors come from rival societies, and may be suspect. No one but members really know what goes on inside the windowless, mausoleum-style structure of brown sandstone to which Bonesmen retreat. But as the Republican presidential nominee\\'s own experience has shown, membership in the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; forms powerful bonds of friendship that endure long after graduation. The vice president was one of 15 Yale juniors tapped for Skull and Bones in 1947. To this day, the Bonesmen who once heard him recount some of the innermost secrets of his life remain his good friends. Perhaps because of the pledge of secrecy that Bonesmen take, Bush did not mention his Skull and Bones membership in his autobiography, ``Looking Forward.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; has long been suspected of ritualistic thefts. A group of history buffs in El Paso, Texas, claimed that the &lt;b&gt; skull &lt;/b&gt; referred to in the society\\'s name belongs to Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, whose grave was robbed in 1926. Endicott Davison, a lawyer who says he speaks for Skull and Bones, said the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; does not have the skull. The former chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe in Arizona charged recently that Bush\\'s father, Prescott Bush, stole the &lt;b&gt; skull &lt;/b&gt; of Apache chief Geronimo years ago, and that it is still on display at Skull and Bones\\' inner sanctum. That claim was denied by the vice president\\'s brother, Jonathan Bush. One thing is not disputed: Bush the Bonesman is in powerful company. Brothers of the order have included Henry Stimson, Averell Harriman, Henry Luce, Potter Stewart, McGeorge Bundy, Archibald MacLeish, William F. Buckley Jr. and William Sloan Coffin Jr. Prescott Bush, a Republican senator from Connecticut, was a member. So was Bush\\'s oldest son, George W. Bush, and about a half-dozen other family members. Skull and Bones is arguably the most famous and influential secret &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; in the United States, having served as a model for others that followed at Yale and other institutions. It was founded by William Russell, a member of the Yale Class of 1833, apparently in reaction to the stripping of secrecy from Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic society, during the rise of a national anti-secrecy movement. Skull and Bones is a private organization incorporated as the Russell Trust Association. It pays taxes to the city of New Haven and owns Deer Island, a resort on the St. Lawrence River. Giving Skull and Bones the benefit of the doubt, Brooks Mather Kelly, in a 1974 history of Yale, wrote of the society: ``Its purpose and programs were not revealed when it was founded and have never since been known. But that like most Yale societies it pretends to some intellectual and educational purpose can probably be assumed.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; ``comes from a tradition of elitism of which Yale was at the center,\\'\\' said Dan A. Oren, author of ``Joining The Club,\\'\\' a book published in 1985 about the relationship between the university and Jews. Skull and Bones became the first of the secret societies to admit a Jew in 1937. During the 1960s, the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; tapped a number of outspoken radicals. Even today, however, it remains steadfastly all-male. Of Yale\\'s seven secret undergraduate societies, only one other _ Wolf\\'s Head _ refuses to admit women. Having women as members would interfere with one of the ways Bonesmen become true brothers. By all accounts, Skull and Bones initiates must lay bare their souls, telling their sexual histories and life stories in graphic detail. ``The danger of secret societies and entering into the club world is it allows members to lose sight of the common folk who aren\\'t part of the elite,\\'\\' Oren said. But he said that Bush\\'s experiences in World War II combat worked the other way. ``For so many veterans, their fight was against the racists and the bigoted values of Nazi Germany, so when they came back, they were embued with a strong sense of egalitarianism,\\'\\' Oren said. Bush, 21 and already married, entered Yale in 1945 after his discharge from the Navy, which awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for his wartime exploits. While on one combat mission, Bush\\'s plane was shot down and he was rescued by a submarine. Two fellow crewmen perished. Bush recounted his brush with death for Bonesmen in 1947 with great emotion, says former Rep. Thomas W.L. Ashley, D-Ohio, another member of the Bones class of 1948. ``What comes to mind was, he was an awful young guy who had had an idyllic kind of childhood who suddenly found himself in an airplane that was on fire facing a lot of death around him and almost certain death himself,\\'\\' Ashley said. Ashley and other Bonesmen in his Yale class are still close friends of Bush. ``Obviously, we became fond of each other,\\'\\' Ashley said. ``This was something kind of special to us.\\'\\' He added: ``George Bush is exactly just as loyal to other friends as those who happened to be in the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; with him. His friendship across the social range is known to everyone.\\'\\' Members of the Bones class of 1948 came to Washington in 1981 for a reunion that included dinner at the vice president\\'s mansion and a tour of the White House Oval Office. ``His having been a member of Skull and Bones and his continued involvement as an alumnus means he would probably be likely to draw upon past connections for the White House,\\'\\' Oren said. ``But his choice of people _ James Baker III to be campaign manager, Dan Quayle as vice president _ shows he\\'s willing to go beyond Yale,\\'\\' Oren said. ``He has always maintained close connections to Skull and Bones, but his world certainly goes beyond New Haven.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.285543267407195  \\n   A jury on Thursday convicted former U.S. Rep. Sam Steiger of theft by extortion for threatening a parole board member to get his vote on a personnel matter while serving in the Evan Mecham administration. ``Any time you go to court you can expect a guilty verdict, but it\\'s difficult to believe,\\'\\' Steiger said in the courtroom moments after the jury returned its verdict. Steiger, who was a top aide to the now-ousted Republican governor, was accused of threatening Ron Johnson, a member of the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. Steiger allegedly threatened to withhold permission for Johnson to work as a part-time Tempe justice of the peace and to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain as executive director Patricia Costello, a Mecham appointee. Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court scheduled a May 6 sentencing for the 59-year-old Steiger, who faces up to five years in prison. Asked whether the verdict would be appealed, defense attorney Thomas Karas said, ``We\\'ll take it one step at a time.\\'\\' Steiger said, ``That\\'s up to counsel.\\'\\' Jury foreman Greg Jones, a fire captain in suburban Mesa, said the deciding factor behind the verdict was ``the tapes of the phone call between Steiger and Johnson.\\'\\' Johnson called Steiger at home from the &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; of the state attorney general, who taped the call. During testimony Monday, Steiger denied that he threatened Johnson or told him how he should vote. But the state alleged that Steiger followed up on the alleged &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; in a letter and a telephone conversation after Johnson voted with the board majority to seek Ms. Costello\\'s resignation. The board voted 4-3 that Ms. Costello should step down because of low staff morale. Steiger, a former five-term congressman, testified that he did suggest that Johnson should back Ms. Costello but denied that he tried to ``steal\\'\\' Johnson\\'s vote by threatening his job. Karas had asked Reinstein to declare a mistrial, contending the conviction of Mecham at his state Senate &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial Monday might prejudice jurors against Steiger. However, Reinstein ruled that great care had been taken to select unbiased jurors. Steiger gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  miles people damage area city water state town south north earthquake feet quake ground residents scale river buildings hit southern &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.81596056916631  \\n   A small &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; rattled central Utah early today, but there were no reports of &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; or injury. The &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; struck at 6:44 a.m. and registered 4.6 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey\\'s National Earthquake Information Service at Golden, Colo. It was an aftershock of an earlier temblor. Initial reports of the &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; came from Price, East Carbon and Helper. The quake\\'s epicenter was 34 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; of Price. The Carbon County sheriff\\'s office said it received numerous calls, and the Emery County sheriff\\'s office also received a few calls from &lt;b&gt; residents &lt;/b&gt; asking about the earthquake. The central Utah &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; hit &lt;/b&gt; by three quakes on Sunday, the largest of which was 5.6 on the Richter scale. The temblors caused minor &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; and were followed by about a dozen aftershocks on Monday. Seismologists had said aftershocks could continue through mid-week. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; is a measure of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 4.5 reflects an &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; 10 times stronger than one of 3.5. An &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; of 3.5 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; can cause slight &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; in a populated &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; and a 4 can cause moderate &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; in the local area. &lt;/p&gt; 0.772637586086353  \\n   A moderate &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; shook southeastern Alaska early today, but there were no immediate reports of &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; or injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported. The 7:01 a.m. temblor measured 5.2 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; and was centered on the mainland about 80 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southeast of Yakutat, or 130 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northwest of Juneau, said George Carte, a warning center spokesman. In Washington, Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, said &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; monitors in Golden, Colo., recorded the tremor at a preliminary magnitude of 4.8 on the Richter scale. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; is a measure of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; 10 time stronger than one of 6.5. An &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage. The 1964 Good Friday &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; in Alaska measured 8.5 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; and was centered in Prince William Sound. It generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed at least 114 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; as far &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; as Oregon and Hawaii. &lt;/p&gt; 0.752233028146661  \\n   A strong &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; shook northern Taiwan on Sunday. Police said it unleashed rockslides that injured 13 people. They said the injured &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; hit &lt;/b&gt; by falling rocks at three waterfall tourist sites in suburban Taipei. The quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, set off rock avalanches in an &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; covering 1,200 square yards, authorities said. The injured, who were all Taiwanese, were taken to a hospital, police said. One was reported to be in serious condition, and the others suffered only minor injuries. The Central Weather Bureau placed the epicenter of the early-afternoon &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; in Sanchi, a coastal village about 10 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Taipei. The &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; was felt in the capital, where &lt;b&gt; residents &lt;/b&gt; reported their houses shook violently, the bureau said. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; measures &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a ten-fold increase in intensity. An &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 5 can cause serious &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; in a populated area, and one of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. &lt;/p&gt; 0.730664497070641  \\n   A series of aftershocks jolted northern Japan on Saturday following several earthquakes, and police reported landslides, cracked roads and damaged buildings. There were no reports of injuries from the series of quakes Friday evening near Takada, 140 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Tokyo. A total of 10 aftershocks had been recorded following the first and strongest &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; Friday evening, which registered 5.5 on the Richter scale, the Central Meteorological Agency said. No Richter readings were available for the aftershocks. All the quakes on Friday were centered at a depth of about three &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; in western Niigata Prefecture along the coast of the Sea of Japan, it said. Police said the earthquakes caused a 75-foot section of a road to sink, set off 30 landslides, and created cracks in roads and the &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; at 60 locations. The hardest-hit &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; was Takayanagimachi, a &lt;b&gt; town &lt;/b&gt; of 4,000 people, where a dozen homes suffered minor damage, including broken furniture and window panes, police said. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; is a measure of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. &lt;/p&gt; 0.636642447179004  \\n   A minor &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; shook pictures off walls in two central Oklahoma communities early today but experts said there was no connection with a potential major &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; on the New Madrid Fault. The Oklahoma Geological Survey said the &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; registered 3.6 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; movement. A &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage. A &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. The National Weather Service said it had received reports of a tremor about 5:45 a.m. that was felt in Rush Springs, about 40 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southwest of Oklahoma City, and Lindsay, about 28 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; of Oklahoma City. The geological survey said the &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; was centered 5 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Lindsay. ``Police departments in those areas indicate that pictures fell from walls, objects were knocked off tables and out of cabinets and many &lt;b&gt; residents &lt;/b&gt; were awakened,\\'\\' the weather service said in a statement. Geological survey director Charles Mankin said earthquakes are common in Oklahoma, with a couple a week detected by sensitive seismographs. ``We rarely record them as high as 3.6,\\'\\' he said. ``But a small &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; in that &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; is not unusual.\\'\\' Larry Thompson of KBLP radio in Lindsay said the station was flooded with calls after the tremor was felt. At the police department, dispatcher Lois Knapp said the shaking lasted about two seconds. ``This police department is cement and brick and rock, and it moved,\\'\\' she said. There has been increased concern about a Midwestern &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; since a New Mexico climatologist projected that there could be a major one in early December along the New Madrid Fault, which runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark. The projection, based on the fact that tidal forces will be particularly strong early next month, is disputed by most scientists. Mankin said there was no link between today\\'s &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; and the New Madrid Fault. ``Most of the earthquakes in Oklahoma we have not been able to relate to faults,`` Mankin said. ``They\\'re very shallow earthquakes and we know they\\'re from some &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; adjustment, obviously, but we can\\'t relate them to some fault.\\'\\' In 1811-1812, a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; struck the New Madrid Fault, ringing church bells in Washington, D.C., more than 850 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; away. Jim Lawson, chief geophysicist at the geological survey, said earlier this week that even if a major &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; occurred along the New Madrid Fault, its effect in Oklahoma would be negligible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  tax income taxes irs benefits estate returns federal paid payments year property pay amount taxpayers interest fees revenue social insurance &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.589980199864205  \\n   The disposition of an individual\\'s &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; need not be a guessing game. Yet many people are unaware that by establishing a sound &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; plan they easily may shelter many holdings from probate. Still more don\\'t know the principles behind assessing their estate. But by better understanding how the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; government governs &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; taxes, people may avoid or reduce the future &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liabilities. This &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; savings can preserve assets in the &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; that otherwise might be used to &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; death taxes. These assets then may be passed on to a spouse, children, or charity. There are several steps to take in evaluating your estate. First, determine the nature and the value of your estate\\'s assets. Assts may include: your residence, other &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; such as a vacation home, household furnishings, savings bonds, stocks, checking and savings accounts, pension benefits, life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies, automobiles. For &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; purposes, there are several exceptions to determining the value of an asset: - For jointly owned assets held by spouses, only half the value of the asset is included in your &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; if you are the first spouse to die. - For life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies, the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; included in your &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; is the face &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of the policy rather than its replacement cost or present cash value (if whole life) at the date of your death. - If you die before retirement, you receive none of your pension. However, half the value of the pension is payable to your spouse and half the vested plan &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; - what would have been available to you had you lived to retirement - are included in your gross estate. - Finally, Series EE bonds are included at their present value when they mature. - All other assets generally are included at fair market value. Second, determine your deductions when calculating &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; tax. Include funeral expenses, costs of the last illness of the decendent, if applicable; unpaid debts and mortgages; and administrative expenses for the estate. You\\'ll incur fewer administrative expenses for assets transferred outside of the probate. To avoid probate, you may set up a living trust, although it will create some trust administration costs. In addition, &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant outside the probate process. Other &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; of a contractual nature - such as life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies or qualified pension plans - also will transfer to the beneficiary outside of probate. Step three, determine which &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; qualifies for the marital deduction or charitable deduction. Three factors make a difference: - If your will transfers &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; to your spouse, this &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; is held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; passes to the surviving spouse and qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; or qualified pension plan names your spouse as policy beneficiary or plan benificiary, this, too, qualifies. The same kinds of arrangements will qualify &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; for the charitable &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; deduction if &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; is left to the charity as a result of a will, a specific &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; designation such as a joint tenancy, or a contractual benificiary designation. Any &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; qualifying for the marital deduction or the charitable deduction is not subject to &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability. Remaining &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; is referred to as the taxable estate. The fourth, and final, step is to determine estimated &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability on the taxable estate. The unified &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; and gift transfer &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; rates apply to the taxable &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; when calculating the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; tax. Every individual, regardless of the size of his or her estate, is entitled to a unified credit of $192,800 that absorbs, dollar for dollar, the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of that individual\\'s &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability up to that amount. This assumes that you did not make any lifetime gifts to an individual in any one &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; while alive that exceeded the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of the gift &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; annual exclusion &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of $10,000. Here, a rule of thumb applies. For your &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability to be greater than $192,800, your taxable &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; must be greater than $600,000. As long as a husband and wife each hold $600,000 in separately owned assets, the couple can own a total of $1.2 million in assets and the entire &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; for both estates avoids &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability. The process of rearranging &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; ownership for &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; assets, so that each spouse\\'s &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; takes maximum advantage is known as ``estate equalization.\\'\\' Many people assume they won\\'t have assets exceeding $600,000, but in these days of appreciated home values and sizable pension plans or life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies, estates are often of surprising size. --- EDITOR\\'S NOTE - Paul Lochray is an academic associate in the &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; planning division of the College for Financial Planning in Denver. &lt;/p&gt; 0.53898425780541  \\n   The Internal Revenue Service said it is closing a loophole that allowed procrastinating &lt;b&gt; taxpayers &lt;/b&gt; to slip out of the country briefly on April 15th and gain an automatic two-month extension on filing their &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; taxes. The new ruling, announced Monday, is effective for &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; forms due next month, and requires &lt;b&gt; taxpayers &lt;/b&gt; to be out of the country for at least two weeks, including April 15th, to qualify for the automatic extension. In the past, someone who left the country for just hours or minutes on the 15th was eligible. &lt;/p&gt; 0.483409614624344  \\n   Farmers who received some government information late have been given additional time to file their 1987 &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; income-tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service said Monday it was granting special relief to farmers who did not receive Agriculture Department documents by the Feb. 15 scheduled date. Those documents are Form 1099-G, which reflects certain government payments, and Form 1099-A, on which acquisitions or abandonments of secured &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; are reported. Farmers generally are not subject to penalties for underpayments if they file their &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; by March 1. The IRS concluded that farmers who failed to receive required information from the Agriculture Department by Feb. 15 might be unable to meet the March 1 deadline. The IRS said farmers affected by the delay should attach to their &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; return a Form 2210F on which they have written their name and Social Security number and, on the bottom right, the words ``farm waiver.\\'\\' With the extension, farmers will have to file &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; any &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; owed by April 15, the deadline for most taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.453584332736209  \\n   The government is losing billions of dollars in &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; revenues each &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; because the Internal Revenue Service does not use an enforcement program on business &lt;b&gt; taxpayers &lt;/b&gt; that it has been using effectively on individuals, a House panel said Monday. A report from the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between $3.2 billion and $8 billion a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt; taxes &lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividends earned by businesses is never collected because the &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; is not reported to the IRS. While the &lt;b&gt; revenue &lt;/b&gt; loss estimates ``are not statistically precise,\\'\\' the report said they provide ample justification for the IRS to include businesses in the document-matching program it now uses to verify &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividend earnings on individual &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; returns. Under the existing document-matching program, the IRS compares ``information returns\\'\\' detailing &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividend &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to individuals with the individuals\\' actual &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; returns. The program in fiscal 1985 produced $2.35 billion in additional &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; revenue &lt;/b&gt; from individuals. Although banks and corporations are not required to file such information &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to corporations, the House report said the IRS received _ but never used _ 26 million such &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; in 1985, showing &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to 5 million businesses totaling $987 billion. ``By casting these information &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; aside, IRS is not only missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported business &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liabilities but has created a double standard of enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than individuals,\\'\\' said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee. IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday the agency has not seen the House report and will have no comment until agecny officials can review it. But at a hearing before Barnard\\'s subcommittee last year, IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said the costs of implementing a document-matching program for corporations would not be justified by the additional &lt;b&gt; revenue &lt;/b&gt; that would be generated. Gibbs said the administrative costs of a document-matching program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different names. Although the problems cited by Gibbs all ``pertain to the way &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; is reported\\'\\' to the IRS, the House report said the IRS ``never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial document-matching program encompassing those corporations to which the difficulties do not pertain.\\'\\' Gibbs told the subcommittee last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; the IRS would begin using document-matching to verify &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; reported on &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; from single-owner businesses and would initiate a multi-year study to determine the extent of business underreporting of &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividend income. He also promised to begin a test program using information &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file any &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; return. The House report said the test program in one district office was so effective the IRS now has expanded it to nine more districts and could have a document-matching program ready by next spring to identify non-filers among corporations and partnerships nationwide. But despite such efforts, Barnard said the IRS ``has not been sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated computer matching capabilities to businesses.\\'\\' ``Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and every one of their &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; will be scrutinized by IRS\\' computers for unreported &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; deserve to know why corporate and partnership &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; are being excused from this automatic examination process,\\'\\' Barnard said. The report said Congress should help the IRS set up a document-matching program for corporate &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; by enacting legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions report to the IRS all dividend and &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to corporations. Barnard introduced such legislation earlier this year, but it was never reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee. &lt;/p&gt; 0.424224737025707  \\n   Social Security officials say a quadriplegic who won a seat in the Legislature has been warned he could lose his medical &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; if he takes his newly won seat and begins drawing expense reimbursements. Bill Boharski, a Kalispell Republican, defeated Democrat Gordon Hall in November, to win his first term in the Montana House. But after drawing expense reimbursements for attending legislative caucuses in November, Boharski said he was notified the reimbursements were ``unearned income\\'\\' that would make him ineligible for continued medical &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; under Medicare and Medicaid. And Boharski, who is paralyzed from injuries he suffered in an automobile accident five years ago, says he can\\'t afford to lose the money. He estimates his medical expenses at $15,000 a year. ``That put me in a position where I had to seriously consider whether or not I had to resign my position,\\'\\' the 27-year-old legislator-elect said. ``That &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of medical bills isn\\'t something you can just pay.\\'\\' Boharski said the situation is not desperate because state and &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; officials are trying to help. Legislative leaders say they\\'re considering a change in state compensation law to redefine the reimbursements, and Boharski said Social Security has advised him the case is under review. Boharski also said he will ask Congress for help if need be. Montana legislators earn $52.13 for each working day in the session plus $50 a day during the session as reimbursement for living expenses in Helena. The 1989 session begins Monday. It\\'s the expense reimbursement that concerns Social Security Administration officials. Mark Fredenberg, operations supervisor for the agency\\'s Kalispell office, said that under &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; law, the expense allowances are considered unearned income. Social Security disability &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; are reduced by the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of unearned &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; over $20 that a person receives, he said. And a person who loses eligibility for those &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; because of unearned &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; also loses eligibility for medical coverage, he said. Most people receiving disability &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; don\\'t work or don\\'t travel to work, Fredenberg noted, saying a situation such as Boharski\\'s arises ``very, very seldom.\\'\\' Boharski said he checked into the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulations before he filed for office last spring. He said he was told then he would qualify for continued medical &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; if elected, under a program that allows people to continue receiving medical coverage even if they are working. Boharski said Social Security officials have since told him he should be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. But, he said, he hasn\\'t yet received written verification. Fredenberg said he could not comment directly on Boharski\\'s case because of &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; privacy laws. Boharski said if legislation at the state level doesn\\'t resolve the problem, he will try to have changes made at the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; level so he can retain his legislative seat. ``I\\'m counting on staying,\\'\\' he said. ``Anyone who knows me knows I don\\'t quit that easy.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  killed army troops guerrillas forces attacks fighting security northern rebels soldiers wounded beirut military ireland bomb terrorist bombing ira responsibility &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.635865970826442  \\n   Rival Christian &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; today used a cease-fire to stockpile weapons and redeploy &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; for their next battle, while civilians fled their ruined neighborhoods for refuge in safer Moslem areas. Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia, refused to give any concessions to Gen. Michel Aoun and said his fighters were ready for war. A source close to Geagea\\'s command said his militia had adopted a new &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; plan to block any attempt by Aoun to storm its strongholds if the current cease-fire collapses. ``If clashes break out anew, it will be a tough, crushing battle throughout the Christian enclave,\\'\\' the source said. Snipers &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; one person and &lt;b&gt; wounded &lt;/b&gt; five in various parts of the Christian enclave today, police said. By police count, the fight for the 310-square-mile enclave has &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; at least 673 people and &lt;b&gt; wounded &lt;/b&gt; 1,877, in addition to inflicting more than $750 million in damage. The dead include 97 &lt;b&gt; soldiers &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since the confrontation broke out Jan. 30. The &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; began when Geagea refused Aoun\\'s demand that he disband the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia in Lebanon. Geagea\\'s 6,000-strong militia has deployed about one-third of its fighters in east Beirut, the &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; source said. They are to defend its urban strongholds and deny Aoun access to the port through the streets of the Ashrafiyeh district. Aoun lost the port in the early days of the fighting. Military analysts believe Aoun must regain control of the port to ensure safe supply lines by sea before accepting any peace settlement. The Lebanese Forces moved new heavy fire power into place in the Kesrouan mountains to harass Aoun\\'s back if he tries to move into the port area, the source said. The upgraded fire power includes about 120 truck-mounted multi-barreled rocket launchers brought out of weapons depots. The launchers, obtained from Iraq more than a year ago, can fire 40 122mm shells a minute. Geagea\\'s men are outnumbered by Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; at least 3-to-1 and hoped to counter his superiority with their upgraded weapons, the source said. Lebanese &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; militiamen, with nearly 15 years\\' experience in street battles, ``are waiting for Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; in the narrow alleys of Ashrafiyeh, which has become a huge garrison,\\'\\' the source said. The militia force defending the port, Ashrafiyeh and the &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; headquarters of Karantina have been beefed up from 1,200 to 2,000 men, the source said. The surrender of Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; Saturday at Adma, an isolated pocket in Kesrouan, freed the militiamen for the new deployment. The source said the bulk of the militia\\'s &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; force, backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers, was deployed along the southern and eastern edges of Kesrouan province, separated from Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; by a no-man\\'s-land of just a few hundred yards. A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations, confirmed that both factions were bolstering their forces. Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; stockpiled ammunition, especially tank cannon and howitzer rounds, in depots in the Metin mountains northeast of the capital. Meanwhile, civilians continued to desert the Christian enclave, seeking refuge in the predominately Moslem areas outside the enclave. The Christian communities, dispersed throughout Lebanon before the civil war, have gradually consolidated in the enclave since 1975. &lt;/p&gt; 0.59707854563647  \\n   Christian and Moslem militiamen today exchanged mortar fire across Beirut\\'s dividing Green Line. No casualties were reported. The two-hour battle in downtown Beirut came amid reports of growing tension between a Christian militia and the Lebanese army. There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth between civil war antagonists in Beirut in two weeks. The clashes have strained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975. The &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians\\' main militia, in east Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital. Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all over the Christian sector of Beirut and along the main coastal highway running north from the city, witnesses reported. Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons searched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But the Christian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension between the militia and the Lebanese army, which is controlled by Christian officers. The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexing show to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army. The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. Michel Aoun, has been quoted by several Beirut newspapers recently as saying the &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; could finish off the militia any time it wanted. Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by the Maronite Catholic commander to become the next president of Lebanon after President Amin Gemayel\\'s six-year term expires in September. Aoun, who has not denied the statements, has not offically proclaimed his candidacy. &lt;/p&gt; 0.575284714154695  \\n   Israeli-backed Christian militiamen shelled a U.N.-policed vilage in south Lebanon today, wounding an Irish peacekeeper, three Lebanese women and an 8-year-old boy. Timur Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, said the Irishman was injured in the head when a 60mm mortar round crashed into one of the Irish battalion posts in Qabrikha, 18 miles east of Tyre. He declined to give the Irishman\\'s name. Lebanese police later said four villagers, including three women and a boy, also were &lt;b&gt; wounded &lt;/b&gt; in the bombardment. Police said the South Lebanon Army militia opened up on the Shiite Moslem village after a roadside &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; exploded in the village of Qantara, in Israel\\'s self-designated securitu zone in south Lebanon. It as not clear whether anyone was hurt in the explosion. The 2,000-man militia patrols the 6-to-10-mile deep &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; zone jointly with Israeli troops. The buffer was established after Israel withdrew the bulk of its occupation force from south Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year invasion. &lt;/p&gt; 0.574702319084469  \\n   Rebels said Friday they had overrun three more government garrisons in southern Sudan and beaten back a &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; convoy trying to stage a rescue mission. In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army said it captured Kologi in southern Kordofan province on Wednesday ``after seven days of heavy &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; preceded by a one-month siege.\\'\\' The broadcast said rebel &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; also ambushed a 33-vehicle convoy, including four tanks, that was trying to reach Kologi and ``forced it to retreat with heavy losses.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; rebels &lt;/b&gt; also claimed the capture of two smaller garrison towns, Bazia on Jan. 24 and Amati on Wednesday. The report could not be independently confirmed, but if true would bring to more than 15 the number of garrisons captured by the &lt;b&gt; rebels &lt;/b&gt; the past three months. &lt;/p&gt; 0.567835175387803  \\n   A ``human bomb\\'\\' attack, similar to last month\\'s IRA &lt;b&gt; bombing &lt;/b&gt; which &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; seven people, failed when the enormous &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; fizzled, police said Friday. No one immediately claimed &lt;b&gt; responsibility &lt;/b&gt; for Thursday night\\'s failed attack but a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabular said the Irish Republican Army was suspected. The RUC spokesman said armed, masked men kidnapped a man from his home near Newtown Butler and ordered him to drive a truck containing a 3,500-pound &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; to an &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; checkpoint at Annaghmartin. The gang tied up the man\\'s elderly parents and locked them in a bathroom while the man was driven near the checkpoint, 56 miles southwest of Belfast. The man was told to deliver the bomb, which they said had a five-minute timer, police said. The man drove the red pickup to the checkpoint, jumped out and shouted a warning. A short time later there was a small explosion, which was believed to have been caused by the detonator going off, police said. Army &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; experts defused the bomb, one of the largest ever found in Northern Ireland, police said. The &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; said there was only minimal damage and no one was injured. On Oct. 24, the IRA staged three human &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; attacks &lt;/b&gt; which &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; six &lt;b&gt; soldiers &lt;/b&gt; and a civilian, who drove one of the bombs to the &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; targets. The IRA is &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland, under socialist rule. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  bush president reagan house white administration american washington summit secretary bush\\'s baker fitzwater leaders economic americans america vice george office &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.367729126260073  \\n   As George Bush approaches the high noon of his quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he is striving to move out of the shadow cast by President Reagan while seeking to capitalize on Reagan\\'s enormous popularity. Reagan\\'s shadow has already shortened for Bush. These days he is seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the president. Instead, the questions now center on whether his candidacy is exerting too much influence over the Reagan White House. Both Bush and Reagan in recent days have fended off suggestions that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort to help the Bush campaign. And confronted with public opinion polls showing Bush far behind among Democrats who voted for Reagan, Bush advisers have now switched strategy to make sure that the Reagan shadow doesn\\'t disappear altogether. After first planning no contact at the Republican National Convention between Reagan and his &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president, a joint rally is now scheduled for Tuesday in New Orleans. It follows an upbeat joint appearance between Reagan and Bush at a rally last Friday for senior &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; officials at the Old Executive Office Building, during which Reagan lavished praise on his &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. If all goes as planned, Bush\\'s transformation into his own man will be complete when he accepts the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, according to aides and GOP consultants. By the end of the convention, ``all the emphasis is going to be on George Bush and his &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; presidential nominee,\\'\\' said his chief of staff, Craig Fuller. Lee Atwater, Bush\\'s campaign manager, said that Bush ``has made a conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to the president.\\'\\' ``And now that he\\'s running for the &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; himself, he\\'s talking about how he feels, what he believes in, and where he wants to take the country,\\'\\' Atwater said. To be sure, there are some areas in which Bush does not want to put much light between himself and Reagan _ largely the current &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; expansion, now in a peacetime record of 69 months, and the fact that most of the world is at peace. The &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; has been inching away from his close identification with &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; policies since he and aides huddled for a week in late May at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine. The consensus from his advisers was near-unanimous: he had to do more to establish his own agenda. Since then, Bush has hinted that he would be more aggressive in dealing with the Soviets, would enforce civil-rights laws more vigorously, would spend more on education and do more to clean up the environment than the &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; he has served for the past 7{ years. He has also proposed many of his own initiatives, including a $2.2 billion child care program, a ban on offshore ocean dumping, and a reorganizaton of the anti-drug effort under the &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. He also has proposed a new White House ethics &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and a ``flexible freeze\\'\\' on federal spending. But most of Bush\\'s moves away from the &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; have been cautious, for fear of appearing disloyal. ``I\\'m not going to change just to emerge from a shadow,\\'\\' he has said. In a recent interview, Bush said he will differ with Reagan when he feels he has a different set of goals. ``I have every intention of saying, here is what we\\'ve done and and here are my priorities. ``But I\\'m not doing that to quote distance myself, to show my own identity,\\'\\' he continued. ``I\\'m doing it to say, look, here is what we\\'ve done. Here are the successes, and here are the shortcomings, and here\\'s what George Bush will do.\\'\\' Still, Bush\\'s close identification with the &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; continues to pose problems for him as Democrats keep driving home their ``Where is George?\\'\\' slogan. When the general election campaign heats up after Labor Day, Bush is expected to be hit repeatedly by Democrats for his role _ still vague _ in some of the less popular Reagan &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; decisions, including arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran and past support for Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Meanwhile, the impact of Bush\\'s candidacy has already been seen in a number of recent presidential decisions _ including Reagan\\'s selection last week of a Hispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to be education &lt;b&gt; secretary &lt;/b&gt; _ fulfilling in advance a Bush campaign pledge. Reagan filled two other Cabinet vacancies with people on close terms with Bush, naming former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh to succeed Edwin Meese as attorney general and Wall Street investment banker Nicholas F. Brady to follow James A. Baker III as treasury secretary. Baker resigned to run Bush\\'s campaign. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; also yielded to Bush\\'s urgings in deciding to allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in the president\\'s veto of a $299.5 billion defense authorization bill. Reagan also has picked up on some of Bush\\'s campaign themes, including advocating the death penalty for ``drug kingpins.\\'\\' ``I don\\'t think it\\'s as much a matter of Bush disagreeing or separating himself from Reagan as much as demonstrating that his agenda is a little different,\\'\\' said GOP consultant Charlie Black, who is a Bush convention adviser. And John Sears, another Republican consultant, said: ``The real moment of truth is when Bush accepts the nomination.\\'\\' ``He can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of the Reagan &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; have brought to the country. And he can prove himself presidential. In his acceptance speech, he can do it all,\\'\\' Sears said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.343152635790944  \\n   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Thank you. Thank you very much. Theresa. You\\'re an outstanding member of the North Carolina Legislature, and I know that you\\'re going to have a resounding re-election victory in November. Thank you so much. Peace, progress, opportunity. That\\'s what we\\'re here to celebrate. That\\'s the legacy of a great president, Ronald Reagan. And that will be the living legacy of the next &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; of the United States, George Bush. First, let me thank the Democratic Party &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; for televising their Convention. What I saw and heard reminded me and millions of other former Democrats why we\\'re proud to be Republicans. The Dukakis convention speech was just like the Democrat platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on spending. We\\'re not running against Bentsen and Dukakis, we\\'re running against Bentsen and Hedges. ``Governor Hedges,\\'\\' ``Governor Hedges,\\'\\' ``Governor Hedges\\'\\' tried mightily to paint over his liberal policies with pretty rhetoric. But the make-up job failed. As an old federal trade commissioner, I want to know -- whatever happened to truth in advertising? But we\\'ve come to New Orleans not to pin the tail on the donkey. We\\'re here to pin our hopes on the American future. And we\\'re not buying the Dukakis deception. Despite what he says, this election is about ideas and ideology. They do matter. They will matter to Americans who face a choice this year as stark and dramatic as any in memory. We Americans faced a similar choice in 1980. And what did we get for our choice? We got a &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; who doesn\\'t apologize for American interests _ he asserts them. We got a breakthrough in Soviet relations and the INF treaty. We got the longest &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; boom in peacetime history. It was my privilege for seven years to serve the man who made this happen _ one of America\\'s greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, for that opportunity. Today\\'s strong economy means stronger families. And we affirm the woman who chooses to work in the home. But our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions of women, and let me say to the women of America: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also ask you to have an open mind. You know better then anyone that a job _ a good job _ is absolutely basic to a family\\'s happiness and stability. That\\'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\'\\') In the past eight years, President Reagan has created an incredible jobs machine _ more jobs for more Americans than ever before. And two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs created since 1982 went to women. Good jobs, not bad jobs. Real work, not make work. That\\'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\'\\') You did it. You were the expansion. You, the women of America _ who are holding jobs as never before, who\\'ve started businesses as never before, who have invested as never before. This expansion _ it\\'s your triumph. But it was Ronald Reagan and George Bush who set in motion the forces which allowed that growth to occur and the economy to bloom. That\\'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\'\\') America is on a roll. If this great &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; upsurge is stopped, if we have a President who raises taxes again and in creases regulation again and stifles growth again _ and believe me, that\\'s what Michael Dukakis will do _ if we let the liberals back in, we lose all that progress _ your progress. &lt;/p&gt; 0.331933696413048  \\n   American officials plan to file a formal protest over Swiss security officers who jabbed a U.S. diplomat with a machine gun and roughed up a news photographer traveling with President Bush in Geneva. ``It\\'s so strange - supposedly a peace-loving nation gave us the most vicious treatment I\\'ve ever seen,\\'\\' White House press &lt;b&gt; secretary &lt;/b&gt; Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One en route home from Switzerland. Fitzwater said the U.S. government would file a formal protest over a number of incidents that occurred when Bush arrived in Geneva for a three-hour stop and again on departure. He also said White House chief of staff John Sununu was ``verbally attacked\\'\\' when he complained. ``I\\'ve never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a security force in the last 10 years,\\'\\' Fitzwater said. American chief of protocol Joseph Reed was poked in the abdomen with a machine gun in one of the airport incidents. Fitzwater said Reed would summon Swiss Ambassador Edouard Brunner and lodge a formal protest next week after Bush returns from a trip to Mexico. ``They pulled a machine gun on Ambassador Reed ... and verbally attacked the chief of staff (Sununu),\\'\\' Fitzwater said. Officers clashed with newsmen and photographers in the president\\'s party on arrival in Geneva, pushing and shoving them as they sought to approach the ramp on which Bush would leave the plane. Fitzwater said that at a hotel in Geneva later Sununu brought up the airport incident with the chief of security. He said Sununu was met with verbal abuse. Guards lined up shoulder to shoulder prevented reporters and photographers from approaching the president\\'s ramp on departure. No one could see Bush at the base of the ramp, though he and Mrs. Bush were visible when they climbed the ramp to board the aircraft. White House press aides tried to get the Swiss officers to move out of the way, and a shouting match followed. It was then that Jerome Delay, a Washington-based photographer for the French news agency Agence France-Presse, was roughed up and the machine gun shoved into Reed\\'s abdomen, Fitzwater said. Reed was trying to reboard the plane, Fitzwater said. There was no immediate word on whether Delay was hurt. The Washington bureau of the news agency said it had no word of any injuries. Fitzwater said he had not discussed the incident with Bush. There was no answer at the Swiss embassy in Washington Friday night. No separate number is listed for the ambassador. &lt;/p&gt; 0.312993868213452  \\n   The emerging Bush &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; includes prominent holdovers from the Reagan years, but with one clear and important difference: The new team is tilted far more toward pragmatists than ideologues. Bush filled three more key positions Monday and his choices were sure to set off cries of anguish from the right. Dick Thornburgh will remain attorney general and Lauro Cavazos will stay on as education secretary. Both men were late-comers to the Reagan &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; and both replaced leading ideologues, Edwin Meese III and William Bennett. The third Bush choice was Richard Darman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget. ``He\\'s put together an Eastern establishment Republican administration,\\'\\' said conservative activist Richard Viguerie. ``That\\'s discouraging.\\'\\' High-profile jobs in the next &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; are rapidly being filled, and only one Bush choice has drawn applause from conservatives _ Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire who will serve as White House chief of staff. The voting machines had hardly stopped humming with Bush\\'s 40-state Election Day victory when the president-elect made the most obvious choice for his new &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; _ friend, adviser and campaign chairman James A. Baker III to succeed George Shultz as &lt;b&gt; secretary &lt;/b&gt; of state. During his tenure as White House chief of staff Baker earned a reputation as a quintessential pragmatist, a savvy insider who repeatedly gave low priority to the initiatives of the more ideological elements in the Reagan administration. Calls on Reagan to fire Baker were always sure applause lines at conservative gatherings. Baker\\'s deputy was Darman. Quick to follow the Baker selection was that of another old Bush friend and adviser, Nicholas Brady. He will remain treasury secretary. In fact, another characteristic of the Bush appointees is how many have long-standing ties to the president-elect. When Ronald Reagan was filling out his &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; eight years ago, he was meeting many of the top officials for the first time. The same was true of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. Not so with Bush. His relationships with the people he has appointed goes back many years. That should not be surprising, considering the years Bush has served in governmental and party posts. The long resume he touted during the presidential campaign put him in close contact with other up-and-coming Republicans. No one ever described Bush as an ideologue and, clearly, the people he feels most comfortable with are as pragmatic as he. It\\'s always tough to get the jump on a new &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; and name his Cabinet for him. But so far there have been no big surprises, no choices from other than the names subject to the most speculation. The names being mentioned for the remaining national security jobs are former Texas Sen. John Tower for Defense and Brent Scowcroft for national security adviser or CIA director. Scowcroft was national security adviser to President Ford and is an establishment figure. One conservative favorite whose name is frequently mentioned for a Cabinet post is former New York Rep. Jack Kemp. But Kemp is most often mentioned as either Labor or Housing secretary, the two areas where he is least-stringently ideological. The former Buffalo congressman has always enjoyed good relations with traditionally Democratic unions and his major urban initiative is a proposal for enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate in neighborhoods with high unemployment. Neither post would make Kemp a major player in areas where his more ideological views on monetary and tax policy would have influence. Bush may yet come up with some appointees who will please hard-line conservatives, but there is no sign of a Bennett, a James Watt or a Donald Hodel waiting in the wings. &lt;/p&gt; 0.288170522493812  \\n   President Bush complained testily Thursday about news accounts which he said portrayed him as deceptive, declaring he would hold fewer news conferences and initiate a ``new approach\\'\\' toward reporters. ``From now on, it\\'s going to be a little different. ... So we\\'ve got a new relationship,\\'\\' Bush told reporters traveling with him aboard Air Force One to the four-nation Colombia drug summit. ``It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it\\'s different,\\'\\' said the president, who has averaged one question and answer session with reporters each week since taking &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; 13 months ago. Later, Bush\\'s press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; was ``just kidding\\'\\' in asserting that he would have fewer news conferences and in declining comment on a series of questions. ``He was having fun,\\'\\' Fitzwater said. The president, who apparently read a wire service account of his testy mood on the plane, protested to reporters later: ``I\\'m not fuming.\\'\\' Bush\\'s pique apparently was triggered by an ABC-TV report Wednesday night recapping instances in which Bush\\'s words were belied by subsequent events. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; was criticized on the same score in a Feb. 26 article in The New Republic entitled, ``The Deceiving Line.\\'\\' Most recently Bush told a news conference on Monday that it wasn\\'t time yet for a conference among the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France on the future status of Germany. ``Not at this juncture,\\'\\' he told the news conference. Yet, the next day, a major agreement was announced in Ottawa by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a German reunification push that would include a &lt;b&gt; summit &lt;/b&gt; among the four powers that vanquished Germany in World War II. ``When I told you ... that I didn\\'t think there\\'d be a deal and there shortly was a deal, then I\\'m hit for deceiving you,\\'\\' Bush groused Thursday. Bush, a onetime CIA director, has conducted much of his foreign policy in secrecy. Two missions to China by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft came despite a Bush announcement in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown that he was barring high-level exchanges between the two countries. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; later insisted that Scowcroft\\'s trips to Beijing were ``visits\\'\\' and not ``exchanges,\\'\\' and thus not covered by the Bush edict. Bush, who usually maintains a bantering relationship with reporters, said, ``I think we\\'ve had too many press conferences. It overdoes it. It\\'s overexposure.\\'\\' By answering few questions directly, he said, ``I\\'m not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive.\\'\\' The president, who slept the night before on Air Force One so he would be well-rested for Thursday\\'s pre-dawn flight here, even gave a prickly response when asked if he had gotten a good night\\'s sleep. ``I had a very good night\\'s sleep. I can\\'t get into the details of that because some will say it\\'s too much sleep, some will say it\\'s too little. ...,\\'\\' he said. Bush parried a series of questions from reporters, most of them dealing with the drug summit. ``I\\'m not going to discuss what I\\'m going to bring up,\\'\\' Bush said when asked about his agenda for the day\\'s conference in Cartagena with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. ``I\\'m not going to discuss whether there\\'s any surprises or not. This is a new thing. This is a new approach.\\'\\' He then said his non-answers were ``a trial run\\'\\' for later dealings with the media. In fact, Bush, who answers reporters questions about once a week, planned to finish his day in Colombia with yet another news conference. Bush\\'s comments with reporters came shortly before his jet touched down here, where a U.S. press center was set up at the airport. Bush flew by helicopter the 60 miles to Cartagena and was returning here before flying home to Washington. Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio Barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to extradite them to the United States if they turned over drug labs, Bush snapped: ``I have no comment whatsoever on that. I have no comment on whether I know about it or not. I can\\'t comment on whether it\\'s true or not.\\'\\' Bush did not mention which particular news reports had irked him the most. However, Thursday\\'s editions of the Washington Post had a story on what it called ``the debate between President Bush and the press over secrecy and deception.\\'\\' And ABC-TV had a news report on Wednesday night by White House correspondent Brit Hume on the same subject. Hume was one of several reporters invited to a recent off the record lunch at the White House with Bush, at which the subject reportedly came up. News accounts said that Bush told the reporters at the lunch that he had undertaken no further secret diplomatic missions _ like Scowcroft\\'s clandestine visits to China. Then, the next day, it was disclosed that Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger had gone on a secret mission to London to notify U.S. allies of Bush\\'s latest plan to reduce troops in Europe. Bush also gave what some have seen as misleading comments on his surprise seaside &lt;b&gt; summit &lt;/b&gt; at Malta in December with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; in September had said that there were no plans for a superpower &lt;b&gt; summit &lt;/b&gt; before 1990, but he later revealed that the session had been arranged as early as last July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  company stock offer corp companies billion business sale share agreement firm sell deal company\\'s bid takeover york shares board announced &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.717134029243594  \\n   Irving Bank Corp. is backing a sweetened merger &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; from Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, which rival Bank of New York Corp. contends is still inferior to its own hostile bid. Irving said on Tuesday that its management had negotiated an amendment to the outstanding &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; by Banca Commerciale, Italy\\'s second largest bank, for 51 percent of Irving\\'s common &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; to include a dividend in the form of &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; warrants to Irving shareholders. Irving said the sweetened &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; made the overall transaction worth at least $79.50 per share, which the bank holding &lt;b&gt; company\\'s &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors deemed superior to Bank of New York\\'s ``best and final bid.\\'\\' Under a complex restructuring plan that also would include the &lt;b&gt; sale &lt;/b&gt; of assets and a special cash dividend, Banca Commerciale has offered $80 cash a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; for 51 percent of Irving\\'s common stock, or a total of about $760 million. The new &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; also provides for Irving to distribute a dividend in the form of &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; warrants to all Irving shareholders before the Banca Commerciale tender offer. The warrants, one for every four &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of Irving stock, would have a term of seven years and an exercise price of $65 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of Irving stock. The new &lt;b&gt; deal &lt;/b&gt; means Banca Commerciale would be offering the same amount of money for Irving &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; even though the &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; would be worth less to the Italian bank because of the distribution by Irving. Irving said BCI\\'s financial adviser, Lazard Freres &amp; Co., put the value of the warrants to shareholders at $4 to $7 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of Irving common stock. Irving &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; closed at $71.37{ per share, up 12{ cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday. Bank of New York rose $1.25 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; to $36.12{. Bank of New York responded that its &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; for all of Irving\\'s &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; remained superior. Owen Brady, a spokesman for Bank of New York, said BNY\\'s financial adviser Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. projected that if Irving &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; sold for $45 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; after a merger with BCI, the warrants effectively would add no more than $1.35 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; in value to BCI\\'s previous offer. Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of its own &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; for each of Irving\\'s common &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; outstanding. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; is valued at around $68 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; or $1.2 billion. Bank of New York has offered to sweeten its &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; by slightly raising the &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; portion of the &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; and adding other shareholder incentives, including a special cash dividend, if Irving agreed to abandon its anti-takeover ``poison pill.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; also has gone to court seeking to remove the defensive mechanism, which would make an unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive. Irving steadfastly has rejected Bank of New York\\'s &lt;b&gt; takeover &lt;/b&gt; advances, which surfaced last September. Estimates of the value of the offers have differed widely. The Irving &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; said analyses by its advisers, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc., said the Banca Commerciale &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; was worth $74 to $79.50 a share. Robert Felise, an executive vice president at Irving, said a separate analysis by Lazard Freres valued the sweetened BCI &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at $80 or more per share. BCI\\'s advisers valued the Bank of New York &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at $72 to $77 a share. &lt;/p&gt; 0.708517320038874  \\n   Santa Fe Pacific Corp. has &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; it will split into three independent entities on Dec. 4. in a move it says will benefit shareholders. The railroad, energy and real-estate conglomerate said Monday that its &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors approved a previously &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; plan to spin off Santa Fe Energy Resources and Catellus Development Corp., formerly Santa Fe Pacific Realty, to shareholders. Santa Fe stockholders of record as of Nov. 29 will receive a special, tax-free dividend consisting of one &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of common &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; of Santa Fe Energy Resources for every 3.3 &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of Santa Fe Pacific held, and one &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of Catellus for every 4 &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of Santa Fe Pacific. Distributions of fractional &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; will be settled in cash. The spinoffs will leave the Chicago-based parent &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; with three interests: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and a 44 percent stake in Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines. Santa Fe &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; in April its plan to spin off the Houston-based energy and San Francisco-based real-estate units as part of a far-reaching restructuring program begun in 1987. Chairman Robert Krebs said in a statement that the values of Santa Fe\\'s diversified assets have not been reflected in Santa Fe\\'s &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; price. Santa Fe Pacific &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; closed 25 cents lower at $13 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. ``Our stockholders should benefit from this separation because it will place a spotlight on the values inherent in those companies,\\'\\' he said. ``In addition, the directors, management and employees of all three &lt;b&gt; companies &lt;/b&gt; will now be able to focus their energies on better utilizing and developing their assets,\\'\\' he said. Santa Fe previously sold 18.3 percent of Santa Fe Energy Resources to the public. Its &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Santa Fe also has sold a 20 percent stake in the real-estate subsidiary to a limited partnership formed by JMB Realty Corp. and the California Public Employees Retirement System. Santa Fe said Catellus has been approved for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt; 0.659351800130039  \\n   Societe Generale de Belgique SA said Thursday it is ready to continue talks with Robert Maxwell that could result in the British publisher gaining a stake in Belgium\\'s largest holding company. Maxwell and Societe Generale agreed in June to cooperate in creating a joint venture in communications, and the two sides had broached the possibility of Maxwell acquiring &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; in Societe Generale. But the negotiations were interrupted when Maxwell turned his attention to Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publishing and information services &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; he has offered to acquire for $2.47 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; in cash. This week Macmillan agreed to a $2.5 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; cash-and-securities buyout by the investment &lt;b&gt; firm &lt;/b&gt; Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., but Maxwell said he was mulling his options. On Wednesday, Maxwell said he remained interested in acquiring a stake in Societe Generale and that talks may resume soon. A spokesman for Societe Generale said, ``We continue to be interested in having more international shareholders.\\'\\' Maxwell appears primarily drawn to Societe Generale\\'s media interests, which are concentrated in Tractebel SA. &lt;/p&gt; 0.643430305298964  \\n   British publisher Robert Maxwell said Friday he will launch a $2.1 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; cash tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; for Macmillan Inc. next week, but made clear his main interest is acquiring its information services business. Macmillan already is the subject of a $1.9 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; from Robert M. Bass Group Inc., a Texas-based investment group. In a letter to Macmillan, Maxwell said he would drop his $80-a-share tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; if Macmillan would &lt;b&gt; sell &lt;/b&gt; him the information company, which Macmillan proposed to separate from its publishing &lt;b&gt; business &lt;/b&gt; in a corporate restructuring. Maxwell said his Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC would be willing to pay ``not less than $1.1 billion\\'\\' in cash for the information business, noting that Macmillan\\'s investment bankers had valued it at ``a range of $800 million to slightly in excess of $1 billion.\\'\\' In the letter, Maxwell also told Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans he was ``willing to explore other forms of transactions with you\\'\\' that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold a significant stake in the company. Maxwell also reitereated he wanted to retain Macmillan management. Macmillan declined to comment on Maxwell\\'s proposals. On Wall Street, the price of Macmillan &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; rose $1.50 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; to $83.25, indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate. ``Some people suggested Maxwell isn\\'t serious, but by launching a tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at $80 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; on Monday, we see he is serious,\\'\\' said Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing &lt;b&gt; business &lt;/b&gt; for the brokerage Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. But Boksen said by making the alternate suggestion that he be sold the information assets, Maxwell ``identified the piece he is most interested in.\\'\\' ``I think Macmillan is backed up against the wall and will try to find a white knight,\\'\\' he said. He said Macmillan could be worth $90 a share. The overture from Maxwell came only three days before a scheduled court hearing in Delaware on whether Macmillan should be allowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring. The restructuring, &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; in late May, would split the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; into separate publishing and information services concerns and pay shareholders a special dividend of $52.35 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; in cash. That plan was advanced after the Bass Group proposed to pay $64 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; for the Macmillan &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; it did not already own. The Bass Group subsequently sweetened its &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; twice, and launched its own tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; for Macmillan at $75 a share. The Bass Group won an order from Delaware Chancery Court blocking Macmillan from proceeding with its restructuring. Macmillan appealed the decision to Delaware Supreme Court, which scheduled a hearing for Monday. Maxwell disclosed his interest in Macmillan in mid-July, saying he would be interested in paying $80 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; for its 25.9 million &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; in a friendly transaction. A Maxwell spokesman said Friday that the tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at that price would commence on Monday. It is contingent on dropping the restructuring plan, among other things, but Maxwell said it is not conditioned upon obtaining necessary financing. Late last month, the Macmillan &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; rejected the $75 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; from Bass as inadequate, but took no position on the Maxwell proposal. Macmillan spokesman David Jackson refused Friday to comment on whether the &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; has since met to discuss the Maxwell proposal, or anything else. Maxwell has vowed to make Maxwell Communications one of the world\\'s biggest media and communications businesses. Through that &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; and Pergamon Press, Maxwell controls the Mirror Group of newspapers in Great Britain, is one of America\\'s largest printers of magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishing academic and scientific journals. &lt;/p&gt; 0.628296633386678  \\n   The London &lt;b&gt; firm &lt;/b&gt; Ward White Group PLC has said it is not interested in pursuing the acquisition of Payless Cashways Inc. after reviewing information about the building materials firm. ``Any interest we had is withdrawn,\\'\\' David Bick, a spokesman for Ward White, said Monday. Molson Cos. Ltd., a diversified Canadian company, also said Monday that it did not have any interest in acquiring Payless after examining public information about the company. Sanjib Choudhuri, senior vice president of corporate development and planning, declined to say why his &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; lost interest. Senior management of Payless has offered $27 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; to take the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; private. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; was made to thwart an unfriendly &lt;b&gt; takeover &lt;/b&gt; attempt by New York investor Asher Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., a competitor of Payless. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; by Payless management is worth $909 million. Bick said Ward White was approached by an investment banking &lt;b&gt; firm &lt;/b&gt; two or three weeks ago about Payless. He said Ward White agreed to request information about Payless because a &lt;b&gt; takeover &lt;/b&gt; seemed worth considering, but Ward White\\'s interest was never great. ``We no longer need nor want the information,\\'\\' Bick said. Ward White owns the third-largest building materials retailing chain in the United Kingdom. The Edelman-Sutherland group is Payless\\' largest shareholder with 8.1 percent of the stock. It had said for weeks that it is interested in acquiring Payless, but has not made a formal offer. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; from Payless management requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders, who have until 3 to respond. Payless has 200 stores in 26 states. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  office filed employees information documents suit lawsuit washington investigation involved allegations questions smith legal case claims pay fraud records wilson &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.504168139457143  \\n   The Justice Department is evaluating the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; against a group of CIA &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; who took 86 rare misprinted stamps from their &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and sold them for thousands of dollars, a department spokesman said Saturday. Justice Department spokesman Tom Stewart said the agency\\'s public integrity section had received the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; and that ``they deal in bringing criminal charges, if necessary.\\'\\' ``I would not want you to think that something is imminent,\\'\\' he said. The Washington Post reported in Sunday\\'s editions that the Justice Department was considering bringing criminal charges against the nine CIA employees, who discovered the rare stamps in the agency\\'s supplies and sold them. The Post quoted unidentified intelligence and Justice Department sources as saying the CIA completed an internal review of what stamp collectors call the discovery of ``the CIA invert\\'\\' and turned the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; over to the Justice Department for possible prosecution. The public integrity section is debating whether to bring charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against the employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 $1 stamps bearing an upside-down candlestick with a sheet of stamps that did not have the rare error, the newspaper said. Each member of the group kept one of the stamps and they sold the 86 remaining stamps in 1986 to a New Jersey dealer for thousands of dollars. Their identities were never made public. A CIA spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call Saturday about the case. &lt;/p&gt; 0.469120181289104  \\n   One or more people associated with Jimmy Swaggart Ministries could be targets of a reopened &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; into the slaying of a woman who left part of her estate to the television evangelist\\'s ministry. Vic Feazell, McLennan County district attorney, said Sunday his &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; is re-examining Ida Lee Baugh\\'s slaying in December 1983 and that a National Enquirer reporter\\'s new &lt;b&gt; information &lt;/b&gt; could help him resolve ``unanswered questions.\\'\\' Feazell said the inquiry was not aimed at Swaggart but could involve ``one or more individuals connected with the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at that time.\\'\\' ``What we are looking into right now is the possibility of violations of the Texas Penal Code that could include being a party to murder,\\'\\' Feazell said. Jacqueline Euna Warren was convicted in April 1984 of murder in the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; and sentenced to 99 years in prison. Mrs. Baugh, 70, of McGregor, was found stabbed and beaten and died later at a Waco hospital. Her husband, Maurice Patrick Baugh, died of heart failure five days later. In their will, the couple left all but 25 percent of their cash, not to exceed $25,000, to the ministry in Baton Rouge, La. A Swaggart spokesman estimated the couple\\'s total estate at between $500,000 and $800,000. Baugh\\'s son contested the will, charging that associates of Jimmy Swaggart ministries exercised undue influence on his parents to change their will. Larry Neale Baugh alleged that two men working on behalf of Swaggart Ministries had recommended that Ms. Warren take care of Mrs. Baugh. Later, Larry Baugh dropped his charges. The Waco Tribune-Herald quoted a source familiar with the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; as saying a settlement was reached between Baugh and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. Feazell said a National Enquirer reporter approached him with new &lt;b&gt; information &lt;/b&gt; he had developed independently. ``The &lt;b&gt; information &lt;/b&gt; was believeable and parts of it have been substantiated,\\'\\' he said. Feazell said his &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; had investigated a possible connection between the murder, the will and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at the time of Ms. Warren\\'s trial. ``Lot of &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; came to light in the spring of 1984 _ unanswered &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; that weren\\'t pursued,\\'\\' he said. ``I met with Jimmy Swaggart\\'s attorneys at that time. After meeting with him, I decided to take no further action,\\'\\' he said. Feazell said that ``as material becomes available, it could be presented to the grand jury\\'\\' during the next few weeks. ``It might be something we can wrap up rather quickly, or we could take a long time with it.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.325335618730338  \\n   A businessman with ties to the Iran-Contra affair has been sentenced to two years probation for his role in a conspiracy to sell confidential Ashland Oil Inc. &lt;b&gt; documents &lt;/b&gt; to Iran. U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum on Monday also ordered Roy M. Furmark, a private consultant in the oil industry, to &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; Ashland $15,000 in restitution. Furmark pleaded guilty in March to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Furmark, of Brooklyn, testified to Congress in 1987 that he was &lt;b&gt; involved &lt;/b&gt; in the sale of American arms to Iran. In the Ashland case, Furmark cooperated with prosecutors for more than a year before his plea and helped implicate former Ashland chairman Orin E. Atkins in the conspiracy. On Friday, Atkins, who also pleaded guilty to conspiracy, was sentenced to two years probation and 600 hours of community service for his role in the scheme. Furmark admitted that he agreed to help Atkins arrange meetings with representatives of the Iranian National Oil Co., which was contemplating a &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; against Ashland for the company\\'s decision not to &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; $283 million for crude oil purchased in 1979. Atkins has said he wanted to sell to the Iranians confidential &lt;b&gt; documents &lt;/b&gt; involving the disputed oil deal that he obtained after he was forced to resign as chairman in 1981 but remained as a paid Ashland consultant. While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued Ashland and last year obtained a $325 million settlement, which with interest was worth more than $500 million. ``This episode in my life has been totally uncharacteristic to my life and what I stand for,\\'\\' Furmark told Cedarbaum. ``I am deeply sorry.\\'\\' Cedarbaum said she considered Furmark\\'s cooperation in deciding his sentence. Furmark set up a meeting with Atkins in 1988 where they discussed renewed efforts to sell the &lt;b&gt; documents &lt;/b&gt; Iran. A videotape of that meeting made by investigators led to charges against Atkins. &lt;/p&gt; 0.31321698051303  \\n   A group of property owners &lt;b&gt; filed &lt;/b&gt; a damage &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday on behalf of the thousands forced to evacuate their homes after a train derailment and phosphorus fire. Named as defendants in the Christian County Circuit Court &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; were CSX Corp. and a subsidiary, CSX Transportation Inc. The complaint alleges negligence on the part of both companies, said Tim Futrell, attorney for the nine plaintiffs, residents of the Crofton and Nortonville areas. ``We are talking in terms of hundreds of millons of dollars in damages,\\'\\' Futrell said. ``Under the rules of civil procedure, you are not permitted to specify a specific amount in the complaint.\\'\\' Futrell said he believed at least 15,000 people could be affected by the case, noting that the accident on June 22 drove about that many people from their homes in seven western Kentucky counties. Lloyd Lewis, spokesman for CSX Transportation, said Tuesday he had no comment. A CXS Transportation tanker carrying phosphorus was among 34 that left the tracks in a ravine near Crofton. The phosphorus spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned more than 12 hours after the crash. There was no fatalities. Futrell said one of the ``reasons we are filing so quickly is because CSX has dispatched representatives to the area to get people to sign releases for a pittance of what they are due.\\'\\' Futrell said some people complained about scratching and itching and difficulty in breathing, and he said there was damage to tobacco and hay crops ``and perhaps to the soil itself.\\'\\' ``Virtually all of the plaintiffs were displaced for at least three days. They lost wages and will be seeking compensation for that.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.280206319002979  \\n   The company that prepares most of the nation\\'s bar exams &lt;b&gt; filed &lt;/b&gt; a federal &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; Friday accusing a preparation service of stealing &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; and undermining the integrity of the tests. The &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; filed &lt;/b&gt; by the National Conference of Bar Examiners, or NCBE, a Chicago company that prepares the Multistate Bar Examination _ 200 multiple-choice &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; administered to law graduates in 46 states. The &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; accuses Multistate Legal Studies Inc. of Philadelphia and Santa Monica, Calif., of sending agents to purposely fail the bar exam, giving them the right to review the tests. While reviewing the exams, the agents memorized, photographed, hand copied or tape recorded the questions, according to the lawsuit. The &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; names Multistate president Robert Feinberg as an agent. Feinberg, an attorney living in California, denied the &lt;b&gt; allegations &lt;/b&gt; and noted that his company won a similar &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; filed &lt;/b&gt; in 1978. The NCBE &lt;b&gt; claims &lt;/b&gt; the ``integrity and quality of the process by which applicants are admitted to the practice of law\\'\\' was tainted by Multistate, which also operates under the name of Preliminary Multistate Bar Review. The &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; seeks unspecified damages as well as injunctions against further copyright infringement. According to the suit, about 100,000 students in 40 states have enrolled in the courses with Preliminary Multistate Bar Review since 1977. The three- and six-day seminars cost $295 to $495 with an additional $395 for written materials, $100 for cassette tapes and about $50 for flashcards. The Multistate Bar Exam, used since 1972, is given twice a year on six subjects. About 58,000 applicants took the exam last year. Questions are prepared by committees of practitioners, judges and law professors and reviewed by others at a cost of about $250,000 per test form. The NCBE releases 50 &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; to the public every other year, but does not reuse released questions.

Martin in a new Agriculture Department report. ``Waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; at aquacultural facilities include diving ducks, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, kingfishers, blackbirds, ospreys and anhingas.\\'\\' These &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; _ the diving ducks include grebes, cormorants and mergansers _ were described as ``voracious &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; eaters\\'\\' that not only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; stock. ``Due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; they consumed are diseased, predatory &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; may transmit diseases from pond to pond,\\'\\' she said. Moreover, when &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; farmers attempt to guard against the airborne marauders, they can be frustrated because a majority of the &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; are legally categorized as migratory and are protected under federal and &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; laws. Martin, a student at Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga., worked as an intern for the department\\'s Economic Research Service the last two summers. Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; species and location, she said losses to &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; have been reported on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; and trout, and are greatest in the largest aquaculture states: Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California and Georgia. ``Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the summer,\\'\\' Martin said. ``In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers, herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late &lt;b&gt; summer &lt;/b&gt; and early fall.\\'\\' She added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to shellfish, although swans occasionally are problems. ``Catfish in the Southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas (locally called &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; turkeys) and kingfishers during the spring and &lt;b&gt; summer &lt;/b&gt; months,\\'\\' Martin said. ``Herons and cormorants cause problems year-round. Crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by purple grackles, herons, egrets, ibises, gulls, diving ducks and kingfishers.\\'\\' Fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as perimeter fencing, netting, overhead wires and other devices, including fireworks, exploders and similar items used to frighten birds. Some chemicals, such as Avitrol, a registered ``frightening agent\\'\\' for use on herring gulls and blackbirds, have also been effective, she said. But &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; and federal permits are required to use this chemical on gulls, because they are legally protected. After ingesting the chemical, the gull ``will behave erratically and emit distress calls,\\'\\' which frighten away the other birds, she said. Some migratory game &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; may be shot during the hunting season, and other permits are available for some species. Local &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; and federal &lt;b&gt; wildlife &lt;/b&gt; authorities should be contacted. Still, Martin said, some &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; farmers believe ``birds are uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile, no matter what method of control of prevention is used.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.533946644642189  \\n   Wood storks have come home to roost in southern Florida, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; won\\'t have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season. Summer deluges at the storks\\' two major ancestral breeding grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; the &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; rely on for food, they explained. Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, a National Audubon Society refuge about 20 miles &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Naples that was once the primary stork-nesting area in North America. Another 75 pairs have taken up residence at Everglades National Park\\'s Cuthbert Island. The two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by North America\\'s sole species of stork, a giant white bird with an iron-black head. ``We are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers,\\'\\' said Paul Hinchcliff, chief naturalist at Corkscrew. ``Whether or not there\\'s enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge enough young remains to be seen.\\'\\' Almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have ended disastrously, said John Ogden, who heads a wood stork study team at Everglades National Park. If they are unable to feed offspring, parent &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; will abandon the colony, leaving hundreds of crying young &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; to starve. Wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers at Corkscrew since 1984-85, when 353 pairs of &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; successfully raised 530 young. Fifty years ago, it was common to see 6,000 to 8,000 pairs of storks nesting in the gray-boughed cypress trees. Since the early 1960s, however, storks have been spurning Corkscrew in favor of central and northern Florida and other Southern states. Between 1960 and 1980, the wood stork nesting population at Corkscrew dropped by 75 percent. The renewed Corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the total U.S. stork population, estimated at 4,000. Historically, storks came to Corkscrew by the tens of thousands to nest in early winter, leaving plenty of time to rear offspring before the onset of rain. But human activity disrupted the annual cycle of high-water summers and low-water winters in Florida\\'s wetlands. Much of the area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions. The &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the deeper waters of the &lt;b&gt; interior &lt;/b&gt; Everglades to drop low enough for them to efficiently feed. As result, nesting is delayed, and this year\\'s young won\\'t be ready to leave their nests until about mid-July, Ogden said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.474262413270188  \\n   The red-cockaded woodpecker, once common in the Southeast, still ranges from Texas to the Carolinas, but is &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; mainly in isolated populations on federal lands. The &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; live in small flocks, called clans, boring nesting holes in living pine &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; about 60 or more years old. The cluster of &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; where the woodpeckers roost is called a colony. According to the U.S. Forest Service, the greatest numbers of known active colonies are &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; in the Appalachicola National Forest in Florida, with 693, the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana, with 314, and the Francis Marion National Forest in South Carolina, where the number dropped after Hurricane Hugo from 487 in 1988 to an estimated 320 to 340 today. Other national forests: Talladega (Ala.), 162 active colonies; Sam Houston (Texas), 133; Bienville (Miss.), 88; Oseola (Fla.), 50; Croatan (N.C.), 45; Angelina-Sabine (Texas), 34; Davy Crockett (Texas), 27; Homochitto (Miss.), 26; DeSoto (Miss.), 18; Ouachita (Ark.), 16; Conecuh (Ala.), 16; Ocala (Fla.), 14; Daniel Boone (Ky.), 6; Cherokee (Tenn.), 1; Oconee (Ga.), 1; Tuskegee (Ala.), 1. &lt;/p&gt; 0.4616020172605  \\n   Wilfred LePage saw his first zebra mussel Feb. 1. By September, thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly sparking a &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; emergency. ``There is no cheap solution to it and there\\'s no real cure to the problem,\\'\\' said LePage, &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; treatment superintendent in Monroe, Mich., on Lake Erie\\'s &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; edge. At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December\\'s deep freeze stopped them from clogging &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; intakes but they quickly settled inside the plant. ``They like it where it\\'s dimly lit, they like it where it\\'s warm, and they don\\'t like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal for them,\\'\\' said Robert C. Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at the plant. ``By July, we\\'re going to have a massive problem with them.\\'\\' Three years after they were introduced to North America and after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread throughout the &lt;b&gt; lake &lt;/b&gt; and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It\\'s an invasion scientists say could affect farming, &lt;b&gt; fishing &lt;/b&gt; and daily life along virtually every body of fresh &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; in North America in the next few years. The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love intake pipes of &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; and power plants because the current brings them a steady supply of fresh food. A mussel can filter more than a gallon of &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; an hour, said R. Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would certainly be a benefit, I guess,\\'\\' he said. Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds, and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said Charles O\\'Neill, with the Sea Grant program at the State University College at Brockport. The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, Flint said. But with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they could deplete the supply for the small &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; that support the billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry. And the bad news could spread beyond the &lt;b&gt; lake &lt;/b&gt; and its shoreline. Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; from the lakes can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because of the shells, O\\'Neill said. ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet to the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; at your tap,\\'\\' O\\'Neill said. ``It\\'s not just an environmental problem.\\'\\' Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in theory, to be edible by humans, Flint said. But when Canadian researchers tried steaming a bunch, O\\'Neill said, ``What they got was a stench that cleared the lab.\\'\\' The mussels have plagued Europe for more than a century and are believed to have arrived in North America on a freighter that emptied its ballast tanks in Lake St. Clair, upstream from Lake Erie, in 1986. Scientists are studying the possibility that the Lake Erie infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986 event, O\\'Neill said. But Flint said one colony could have infested the &lt;b&gt; lake &lt;/b&gt; because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells. ``They could easily get across Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in that period of time,\\'\\' he said. For public &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the intake pipe rather than waiting until the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; is inside the plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have already faced the problem. Power plants have a different problem, because officials are reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in cooling &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; discharged back to the lake, Henderson said. Niagara Mohawk and the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Department of Environmental Conservation are negotiating a solution. James Sell, chief operator of the Dunkirk &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; plant, is studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe\\'s mouth, like building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine pipe out through the intake. ``We\\'re better off than the people in the &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; end of the lake,\\'\\' Sell said. ``At least we have some time to do something by spring.\\'\\' The City Council hasn\\'t been persuaded to pay up to $100,000 for the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to show visitors, said, ``I don\\'t see much option for them if they want a &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; supply.\\'\\' Farther inland, many &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; officials are unaware of the problem or not prepared to do anything about it. Michael Burke, director of the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Health Department\\'s bureau of public &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; supply protection, said the department was studying the problem but doesn\\'t see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word\\'s getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in the Great Lakes. It is coming out in industry papers and things of that sort.\\'\\' O\\'Neill and other scientists said the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; should do more to get the word out, because it is only a matter of time _ and not necessarily very much time. ``The chances of them getting into the &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; reach of the Erie Canal is good,\\'\\' O\\'Neill said. ``The canal is an ideal place for them to live. It\\'s warm. It\\'s shallow. Most of it has rock riprap to attach to.\\'\\' Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their engine housings and other places where &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; collects. Once the mussels get into Lake Michigan, they will almost certainly spread through the Chicago River and into the Mississippi River basin, O\\'Neill said. ``Any area in North America that is utilizing surface &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; should be concerned.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.436668989864492  \\n   They could have been cremation pits, cock-fighting rings, animal pens, Civil War foxholes or secret hiding places for moonshine equipment. Maybe they were prehistoric Indian burial sites, charcoal pits or foundations for native American abodes. Or maybe, some say, the &lt;b&gt; stone &lt;/b&gt; circles dotting the &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; slope of Polish Mountain encircled apple &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; in the early 1900s. For more than a decade, 150 to 200 circles of sandstone rock have puzzled area residents and archaelogists. Virtually hidden by brush and poison ivy, the gray-colored rocks of various shapes and sizes are neatly arranged in circles. No one knows their purpose, or who put them there. ``Everybody that goes up there has some kind of weird theory,\\'\\' said John Mash, manager of Green Ridge State Forest, where the circles are found. ``One guy even mentioned that they could have been sweat lodges _ like a Turkish bath. ``The Indians would have these rituals when they would go into manhood,\\'\\' he said. ``They would go in these buildings with hot rocks and put &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; on them _ something like a sauna.\\'\\' But 150 to 200 saunas on one hillside in &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; Maryland? Mash said rangers noticed the &lt;b&gt; stone &lt;/b&gt; rings in the early 1970s. In 1975, Mash contacted State Archaeologist Tyler J. Bastian, who visited the site and put the circles on a list of archaeological areas in Maryland. But it was not until last year that some archaelogists and volunteers excavated one of the circles. ``They did the dig and &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; zip, except for the rattlesnakes,\\'\\' Mash said. Hoping to uncover clues, another group conducted a dig this spring. ``In a nutshell, we didn\\'t discover anything. They still remain a mystery,\\'\\' said Charles McVeigh Jr., a member of the Western Maryland Archaeological Society. ``We dug out in the center of them. We didn\\'t go down very far before we got to bedrock. We &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; no artifacts. We &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; nothing to indicate prehistoric use.\\'\\' No future digs are planned, and two local archaeologists who took an interest in the circles, Robert D. Wall and Connie Huddleston, both have moved from Maryland. Neither could be reached for comment recently. Meanwhile, the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; forest has put the circles on its historic preservation list to ensure the five-acre tract remains untouched, Mash said. The site could be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places if additional information could be &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; to document the age of the rings, their use and significance. Mash has dismissed the moonshine theory because there is no nearby &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; source needed to make moonshine. He said he did not think they were cock-fighting rings because only one pit is needed to hold a fight. And the rings are too close together to have been foxholes during the Civil War, he said. ``The site has no strategic value,\\'\\' Mash said. ``(And) the guy in the middle foxhole is going to be shooting his own pals before he can get his bullet out to hit the bad guys.\\'\\' Until someone conjures up a more believable theory, Mash said he puts the most stock in the orchard theory _ that someone placed the stones around apple &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; that once grew in the area. There were 1 million apple &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; in Green Ridge by 1914, he said. ``It is possible that they hired immigrants who could not understand directions given in English and some of them were told to clear the rocks away to plant the apple trees,\\'\\' he suggested. ``They were new in America and wanted to do a nice, neat job, so they put these rocks in nice neat little circles and left a space in the middle for the tree. And they might have worked on these for a couple of days, or a week until somebody stopped them. That could be a theory ...\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  percent poll survey found conducted points error voters results margin surveys sunday apple percentage lead arthritis choice released blacks journal &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.548634839018024  \\n   President Bush has a 56 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; approval rating among blacks, a huge increase over the ratings given former President Reagan, according to a new CBS News-New York Times poll. Only 13 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; supported Reagan at about the same point in his presidency, CBS Evening News reported Thursday. In May 1982, Reagan had a 73 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproval rating among blacks; in the current poll, 26 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; surveyed disapproved of Bush, said Kathleen A. Frankovic, of the CBS network\\'s polling division. CBS-Times polls &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; during Reagan\\'s entire time in office &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; he had an average 67 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproval rating among blacks, Frankovic said. The new &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; is the fourth consecutive Times-CBS News &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; in the last six months in which a majority of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; said they approved of Bush\\'s handling of his job, the Times reported in today\\'s editions. For the last 30 years, five out of six &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; have voted for the Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who the nominee was, CBS reported. In the new poll, one out of 10 &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; said they probably would vote for Bush against a Democratic candidate in 1992, while another 20 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said their &lt;b&gt; choice &lt;/b&gt; would depend on who was running, the Times said. One-third of the &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; surveyed, and 46 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the whites, said their opinion of Bush had improved since he became president, the Times said. Blacks were evenly divided on whether Bush is doing a good job handling the war on drugs, while whites approved 56 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 35 percent, the Times said. White respondents gave Bush an overall approval rating of 75 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 14 percent. The telephone &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; of 1,515 adult Americans, including 403 blacks, was &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; March 30-April 2. The &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; for the entire &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; is plus or minus 3 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; points; for &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; it is 5 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; points. &lt;/p&gt; 0.496616609140398  \\n   One new &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; suggests Vice President George Bush is running neck-and-neck with Gov. Michael Dukakis, while another &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; indicates the Republican nominee-to-be is only slightly behind his Democratic rival. The new &lt;b&gt; results &lt;/b&gt; contrast with a series of &lt;b&gt; surveys &lt;/b&gt; in recent weeks indicating Bush trailed Dukakis in double digits. A telephone &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; of 1,013 adults last week by ABC News and Money Magazine, &lt;b&gt; released &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; 45 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; support for Dukakis and 42 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; for Bush. That amounts to a tie, given the &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; of plus or minus 4 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; points. And a Gallup &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; of 1,210 voters, also out Wednesday, suggested Dukakis had the support of 46 percent, to 41 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; for Bush. The &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; was 3 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; points. By contrast, Gallup, NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Washington Post polls &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; since June 9 have &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; double-digit leads for Dukakis. The Post survey, done June 15-19, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a 51-39 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; Dukakis margin. The ABC-Money Magazine poll, &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; June 22-25, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; support for Dukakis down 7 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; from an ABC-Post &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; in mid-May that used the same methodology. Bush rose only from 41 to 42 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; support; those who didn\\'t know grew from 2 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 6 percent. The rest said they wouldn\\'t vote or would support someone else. Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories. A Harris &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; early this month &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a dead heat _ 49-44, with a 3-point &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; _ and a USA Today-CNN &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; gave Dukakis a single-digit lead. The ABC-Money Magazine &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; had Dukakis leading among women, respondents earning less than $25,000 a year and adults aged 35 to 54. Bush led among men, respondents earning more than $50,000 and those in the 55-64 age group. &lt;/p&gt; 0.415575222157962  \\n   Public approval of President Bush\\'s handling of the economy and his handling of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait dropped in recent weeks, according to a CBS News-New York Times &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; released &lt;/b&gt; Saturday. Bush\\'s 60 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; overall approval rating in the &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; is the worst of his presidency, but still higher than that recorded for Presidents Reagan and Carter at the same point in their administrations. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a majority of Americans still approves of Bush\\'s actions in the Persian Gulf, but the 57 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; approval rating is down from 75 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; soon after the invasion. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; 34 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproved of Bush\\'s handling of Iraq. Asked to rate Bush\\'s handling of the economy, 52 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they disapproved and 36 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they approved. In August, 45 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; approved of Bush\\'s handling of the economy, and 44 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproved. Amid heightened concern over Bush\\'s handling of the economy and the budget deficit, 30 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they disapproved of his overall performance - the highest level of his presidency in the CBS-New York Times poll. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; among a random sample of 960 adults around the United States interviewed by telephone Monday through Wednesday. Results of such a &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; should generally be accurate to within 3 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; in either direction. &lt;/p&gt; 0.411847762705052  \\n   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis begins his race against Republican George Bush with a 12-point advantage, according to an ABC News poll. The network reported Thursday that Dukakis leaped to a 53-41 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; in a &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; of 450 registered &lt;b&gt; voters &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, up from his 45-46 virtual dead heat with Bush in ABC\\'s &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; Sunday. The movement was 13 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; _ from 1 point down to 12 up. The jump was expected; polls in other elections have &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; that nominees often gain support immediately after their party\\'s convention. Such bumps frequently settle back down as &lt;b&gt; voters &lt;/b&gt; focus on the substance of the race. The &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; reflected the success of Dukakis\\' peacemaking with Jesse Jackson, his opponent for the nomination. Sixty-eight &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said Dukakis was treating Jackson fairly, up from 52 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in a &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; early this month. Similarly, 70 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said Jackson was treating Dukakis fairly, and the share of respondents with an unfavorable view of Jackson fell 11 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; from Sunday, to 31 percent. Those with a favorable view rose 9 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; to 52. The national &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a rise in unfavorable views of Bush, who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week. His favorable rating fell from 49 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 41 percent, while those viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; Sunday to 44 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday. The poll, completed the day before Dukakis appeared at the convention, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; little change in his favorable-unfavorable rating, 55-21. Dukakis\\' 12-point &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; against Bush did not mark his greatest numerical advantage in an ABC poll; the Massachusetts governor led by 53-40 in late May. The &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; for the new &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; was 5 points. Such single-day surveys, particularly when &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; during or just after a highly publicized event, tend to measure visceral reactions rther than considered opinion, so the views they gauge can change rapidly. Dukakis continued to do better with women &lt;b&gt; voters &lt;/b&gt; than with men, and the &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; that he had gained more ground among women _ leading Bush by 25 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; in the new poll, up from an 8-point &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; Sunday. Dukakis scored a tie with Bush among men, after a 12-point Bush &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; Sunday. Dukakis improved with independents, scoring 48-42 against Bush after a 52-35 &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; for Bush among independents Sunday. And 59 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Democrats who had bolted the party to vote for President Reagan favored Dukakis now. In another measure of the convention\\'s impact, 52 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said the Democrats could be trusted to do a better job with the nation\\'s problems, up 9 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; from Sunday. And 40 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they generally approved of the proceedings in Atlanta, while just 13 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproved. Nearly half said they had not been paying enough attention to say. &lt;/p&gt; 0.399764014728187  \\n   The Associated Press &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; on homelessness was &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; by telephone Dec. 5-9 among a random sample of 1,004 adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa. The &lt;b&gt; results &lt;/b&gt; were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; had a three-point &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of sampling error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within three &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. Is your knowledge of the homeless a result of something you have seen or dealt with in person, or is it just based on news reports and word of mouth? In person: 45 percent. Word of mouth: 54 percent. Don\\'t know or no answer: 2 percent. 2. Which of the following statements best reflects your attitude toward the homeless in the United States today? - The homeless themselves are mainly at fault because of their unwillingness to work or their behavior, such as alcohol or drug use: 17 percent. - Our society is mainly at fault because we do not provide sufficient housing for them: 20 percent. - Neither the homeless nor society is mainly at fault because they become homeless through tough breaks or bad economic luck: 41 percent. - (volunteered answer) Combination of both homeless and society: 17 percent. - Don\\'t know or no answer: 5 percent. 3. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should be increased, decreased, or remain the same? Increased: 58 percent. Decreased: 7 percent. Remain the same: 23 percent. DK-NA: 12 percent. (For those who said increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for that? Yes: 75 percent. No: 22 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent. 4. I\\'m going to ask you to rate the chances that you or a member of your family could become homeless in the coming year. Do you personally feel the chances are ... Very likely: 4 percent. Somewhat likely: 11 percent. Somewhat unlikely: 16 percent. Not at all likely: 67 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent. 5. Do you know someone who has become homeless in the last year? Yes: 15 percent. No: 85 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  police people bus violence injured demonstrators protest capital protesters today city building security arrested students protests killed fired streets fire &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.584121179491273  \\n   Police in western Bangladesh opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; on transport workers striking against alleged &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; harassment and 15 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were injured, according to news reports Sunday. The indefinite strike halted &lt;b&gt; bus &lt;/b&gt; traffic in 16 districts and stranded thousands of &lt;b&gt; bus &lt;/b&gt; passengers, the government-owned Dainik Bangla newspaper reported. Police and &lt;b&gt; demonstrators &lt;/b&gt; clashed in Pabna, 75 miles northwest of Dhaka, the paper said, but it did not specify how many of the &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; and how many were police. It also did not say how many were wounded by the gunfire. Police said they opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; when the workers tried to storm an office of the road transport authority. On Saturday, 50 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; when pro-government workers and opposition-backed laborers clashed, using homemade bombs and knives, over the ouster of a union leader in Adamjee, 10 miles south of Dhaka, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.518228157417174  \\n   Hundreds of policemen deserted their posts or stayed home &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; after anti-monarchist mobs beat to death six of their colleagues in daylong rioting, government sources said. At least three &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; stations in the &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; were seen to be empty. Almost none of the capital\\'s 4,000 policemen were walking the streets. A few armed policemen entered deserted &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; stations late &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; but allowed no one to enter. A 10-hour curfew restricting &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; to their homes began at 7 p.m. and some policemen in jeeps and trucks patrolled the city. Monday\\'s &lt;b&gt; violence &lt;/b&gt; was the worst since April 6, when &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; on pro-democracy demonstrators, and threatened the fledgling pro-democracy movement in this Himalayan kingdom. Until this month, King Birendra had exercised virtually absolute power. Five civilians were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; gunfire in Monday\\'s unrest and, according to the state-owned Rashtriya Samachar Samiti news agency, 15 policemen were missing. Only one policeman had been found by late today. The mobs accused &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; of condoning and sometimes joining an underground pro-monarchist group blamed for a wave of crime since a new government headed by pro-democracy forces took office last week. Two policemen captured early Monday were beaten for more than six hours before they died. Four more policemen were dragged from a &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; station and lynched by hundreds of people. The crowds also set afire the zonal commissioner\\'s office, which houses a &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; station. Today, two policemen in riot gear stood guard outside the charred building. They were the only policemen seen on foot during an hour-long tour of Katmandu. ``There are no policemen anywhere in the city,\\'\\' said a taxi driver who said he had been driving the &lt;b&gt; streets &lt;/b&gt; for six hours. ``Even traffic policemen are absent today.\\'\\' One government source said the policemen were either ``unofficially withdrawn or are too scared to come out.\\'\\' Senior &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; officials could not be located for comment. But shops opened and &lt;b&gt; streets &lt;/b&gt; were clogged with traffic &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; after a ten-hour curfew clamped on Monday night was lifted at 6 a.m.. There were no reports of violence. ``The tremendous amount of confidence the &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have in this government is compensating for the absence of police,\\'\\' said Home Minister Yog Prasad Upadhyay. ``This is apparent from the fact that ... the country is peaceful.\\'\\' Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai met with King Birendra &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; to discuss the situation, officials said. No details of the meeting were available. A scheduled meeting of the Cabinet was postponed, officials said on condition of anonymity. There had been indications a shake-up in the top ranks of the &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; force might be forthcoming after the Cabinet meeting. Bhattarai and his government, a coalition of democrats, Communists, royalists and independents, took office last Thursday after an eight-week campaign against the previous regime, which was subservient to the king. King Birendra caved in to the campaign on April 8, two days after &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; shot and &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; 200 &lt;b&gt; demonstrators &lt;/b&gt; as they marched on the palace, according to witnesses. The government said 10 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and 107 wounded in all of Nepal on that day, but two days later Birendra lifted a 29-year ban on political parties. Within 24 hours of the new government taking office, the &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; of 250,000 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; was faced with a rash of arson, mugging and looting, which residents blamed on a right-wing pro-monarchist group called Mandale. The Mandale, an abbreviated form of Nepal Vidyarthi Mandal, or Nepal &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; group, went underground in 1979 after Birendra officially banned the group because of its violent tendencies. &lt;/p&gt; 0.477138331219829  \\n   Five radical &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; armed with bombs and knives seized a U.S. Information Service office &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; and detonated two bombs and started a &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; before &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; overpowered them. Two of the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; brandishing explosive devices and draped in South Korean flags stood at shattered windows on the second floor yelling ``Yankee go home\\'\\' as riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; ringed the building. U.S. Embassy officials said they had no reports of injuries, but the attackers smashed windows and set a &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; in a periodical storage room. Thick smoke filled part of the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; located in the heart of Seoul. People inside the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; at the time of the attack, including at least one American, were not detained by the radicals. The students, who said they were members of the ``Young Student Suicide Group\\'\\' claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed at surrounding &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; to stay away. They tossed down a statement charging the United States was attempting to make South Korea a colony. ``Yankees stay out of Korea,\\'\\' the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; yelled. A &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; officer said it was unclear how many of the explosive devices the attackers had. The bombs were crude chemical devices, possibly some kind of plastic explosive, he said. About 200 radical &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; about an hour later outside Myungdong Cathedral. Police &lt;b&gt; fired &lt;/b&gt; volleys of tear gas at the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; who yelled slogans denouncing President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who is to be sworn in Thursday. Hundreds of &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; had gathered at the cathedral less than a mile from the U.S. Information Service office earlier in the afternoon for an anti-government protest. ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,\\'\\' the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; yelled. Some of the attackers were reading in the office\\'s library when there was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenly pulled out bombs and started screaming slogans, eyewitnesses said. At least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it, they said. ``He was kind of crazy-eyed,\\'\\' said Paul Wadden, a visiting American teacher who was reading in the library at the time. The attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main street outside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the street and brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters. Riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; stood on the sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shattered glass covered the street. The &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; tossed at least one bomb into the street where it exploded harmlessly, eyewitnesses said. A second bomb was tossed out, but did not explode, they said. People caught in the library said the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; did not attempt to detain them and they were able to leave after recovering from their initial shock. Wadden said he and other &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were prevented from leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; guards. There were about 40 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; in the library at the time, most of them Koreans, eyewitnesses said. Police who entered the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; by the rear entrance overpowered the &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; about 30 minutes after the attack began. The &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; were taken out of the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; in a &lt;b&gt; bus &lt;/b&gt; with covered windows. U.S. Embassy officials said South Korean riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; entered the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; at their request. Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita arrived at the Lotte Hotel across the street from the U.S. Information Service office just as the incident ended, officials said. Takeshita is in Seoul for Roh\\'s inauguration. American diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know why the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; attacked the U.S. facility. ``We have no idea what the motivation was,\\'\\' an embassy official said. The United States is South Korea\\'s chief ally. Washington has 40,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against communist North Korea. The U.S. Information Service provides reading material and other materials on the United States and operates libraries and information centers around the world in conjunction with American embassies. The service office in Seoul is located about half a mile from the American Embassy. The same office was seized by 73 radical &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; for four days in May, 1985 as an anti-American protest. They ended the occupation peacefully and some later received prison sentences. U.S. Embassy officials were unable to explain &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; how the attackers were able to bring weapons into the well-guarded building. Visitors must pass a metal detector, present identification and have their bags searched and there are &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; guards inside and outside. The statement by the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; denounced Roh as a puppet who had been installed by the United States. South Korean radicals have repeatedly charged the United States has kept a series of authoritarian governments in power in South Korea. Roh, a former general, won the first democratic elections in 16 years last December. &lt;/p&gt; 0.475636300053292  \\n   Police clashed with about 250 stone-throwing Moslem fundamentalists who attacked a theater troupe, a &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; source said Wednesday. One student was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and four were &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; as officers dispersed the crowd. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incident took place Tuesday night at the village of Kodeya, 25 miles from the southern provincial &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; of Assiut. He said it wasn\\'t known what &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; 23-year-old Mohammed Kotb. One of the four wounded &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; was in critical condition, he added. In a statement read to The Associated Press by telephone, a fundamentalist spokesman claimed the student was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; gunfire. ``The Moslem group went out through the village in a peaceful march of &lt;b&gt; protest &lt;/b&gt; ... when &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; attacked them with tear gas and opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; on the demonstrators, killing the student Mohammed Kotb,\\'\\' the statement said. The spokesman, who refused to give his name, said forces then surrounded the village, raided homes and detained fundamentalists. The spokesman said the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; were protesting a ``dancing party\\'\\' organized by &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; forces. The &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; source, however, said the fundamentalists attacked a theater troupe performing a play about Islam and peasants. The troup had been invited to perform by the government\\'s culture club at the village. ``Around 250 Moslem fundamentalists from the village and nearby villages gathered in a mosque after evening prayers and then moved to the hall where the play was being performed, carrying stones and rocks,\\'\\' the source said. He said the students, from a teacher training college, ``attacked the hall and tried to destroy the building,\\'\\' but &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; forces surrounded them and used tear gas and sticks to disperse them. He did not say whether &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; made any arrests. Police forces guarded the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; until the play was finished, the source said. The southern Assiut province has been a hotbed of fundamentalist agitation for almost a decade. Fundamentalist &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; armed with knives, bicycle chains and stones, attacked an Assiut University campus parade on March 7, denouncing it as an anti-Islamic ``dancing and singing party.\\'\\' In the ensuing clash with &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; forces, two &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; and two policemen were wounded. &lt;/p&gt; 0.449178970764982  \\n   Thousands marching against government austerity measures fled in panic Thursday when &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; fired &lt;/b&gt; rifles and tear gas after hooded youths smashed store windows. Three &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were injured, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. The &lt;b&gt; violence &lt;/b&gt; came 11 months after rioting left about 300 dead following &lt;b&gt; protests &lt;/b&gt; over subsidy cuts on food and public transportation. About 8,000 union members and supporters marched in the &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; while thousands of others marched across the country in &lt;b&gt; protest &lt;/b&gt; of government reforms aimed at cutting a $34 billion foreign debt, fourth-largest in Latin America. The march in Caracas was interrupted when a group of adolescents overturned garbage cans and shouted insults at police. About 20 of the youths began breaking windows in Simon Bolivar Center, a complex on Plaza Caracas, where the march was to end. Police rushed in firing tear gas and shotgun blasts in the air. Three &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; in the brief confrontation, including Rafael Calma, a photographer for a Caracas newspaper, hit by a bottle thrown by a bystander in the crowd, said police. Police did not say how the other two &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were hurt. ``It was the same group of troublemakers. A small group. We acted responsibly,\\'\\' said metropolitan &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; sheriff L.B. Gomez, standing his ground as &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; chanted, ``Police off our streets! The &lt;b&gt; streets &lt;/b&gt; are ours!\\'\\' ``It\\'s the fault of the government\\'s economic package,\\'\\' said a leftist congressman, Ricardo Guttierez, participating in the march. The march was called by the 4 million-member Confederation of Workers, CTV, Venezuela\\'s largest umbrella labor group. The CTV has called on President Carlos Andres Perez to back off on austerity measures it says has hit poorer Venezuelans the hardest. Labor leaders have planned &lt;b&gt; protests &lt;/b&gt; this month after Perez\\' year-old Social Democratic government planned to cut subsidies on gasoline. The economy last year contracted by 8.1 percent and inflation rose to 80 percent under the effects of the austerity measures. Unemployment is about 11 percent, according to independent estimates, up from 8.7 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  york san city los angeles california john francisco today washington robert william calif houston michael louis paul cities park baltimore &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.777615553462059  \\n   101.

He died Saturday at age 68. More than 1,000 people crowded into St. Matthew\\'s Cathedral for the 2{-hour Mass before Williams was laid to rest in St. Gabriel\\'s Cemetery in Potomac, Md., near his home. Pallbearers included Washington Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee, columnist Art Buchwald, former Cabinet officer Joseph Califano and law partner Brendan Sullivan. Williams died at Georgetown University Hospital after an 11-year battle with cancer. At the time of his death, Williams presided over the Washington law firm of Williams and Connolly and was owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.

Federal prosecutors say Gerald M. Chernow, 49, and William M. Engelman, 52, cheated the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook by persuading maintenance engineer David Hilt to buy unneeded maintenance and roofing equipment that was marked up by up to 20 times its cost. Initially, Hilt was given merchandise, gift certificates and money orders, and later, his wife, Ellen, was put on the payroll of one of the Michigan companies, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Gleason said. Chernow and Engelman, both of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., entered innocent pleas before U.S. Magistrate David Cohen. Chernow and Engelman were freed on their own recognizance, but they must hand over their passports and will be required to pay $50,000 bond if they fail to show up to any court proceedings, Gleason said. The two businessmen had appeared in court without being arrested. The two are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and the use of interstate facilities in furtherance of private bribery. Both businessmen declined to comment on the case, as did defense attorney Julian Sweet of Lewiston. Also named as defendants in the 21-count indictment are Modern Research Corp. and Lincoln Technical Services Inc., both of Troy, Mich., and ABC Chemical Co. of Detroit. If Chernow and Engelman are convicted on all counts, they face up to 105 years in prison and fines totaling $5.25 million each, the prosecutor said. Modern Research and Lincoln Technical Service each face up to $10.5 million in fines, while ABC Chemical could face $6.5 million in fines. Philadelphia-based Scott Paper lost between $750,000 and $1 million in the scheme, the government says. &lt;/p&gt; 0.275014308112386  \\n   Thirteen Americans and six Canadians were honored as heroes &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.

Dissatisfaction in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has been fueled by political reforms proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Baltic residents say the changes will void their constitutional right to secede and give Moscow control over their &lt;b&gt; economy &lt;/b&gt; and other aspects of life. The Politburo, the Communist Party\\'s supreme body, promised Thursday to hold a discussion on expanding the rights of the 15 constituent Soviet republics. But the dispatching of three of its members to the Baltic region indicated the Kremlin wants to draw the line now on what sort of political changes can be contemplated. The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet parliament is to meet in special session in Moscow on Nov. 29 to approve Gorbachev\\'s blueprint for political change, which also increases the powers of the presidential post and creates a new national legislature. Viktor M. Chebrikov, the former KGB chief who now heads a party Central Committee commission on legal and judicial reform, opposed demands for local &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; independence in comments to workers at a plastics factory in Tallinn, Estonia, according to Tarmu Tammerk, an Estonian journalist. ``He said very strong words against &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; independence. He said the whole of the Soviet &lt;b&gt; economy &lt;/b&gt; is so tightly linked that one cannot speak of independence for one of its parts,\\'\\' Tammerk, who works for the newspaper Homeland, said in a telephone interview. Chebrikov\\'s remarks were broadcast on state-run Estonian radio in an attempt to give them the widest possible exposure. ``His words sounded like a grim warning to people here,\\'\\' Tammerk said. ``Economic Independence\\'\\' has been the watchword of a widespread movement in Estonia called the Popular Front, which seeks greater control by Estonians over the affairs of their Switzerland-sized republic. Estonians say the fruits of their labor are siphoned off by Moscow to subsidize poorer regions of the country, including the giant Russian federation, the largest Soviet republic. Two of Chebrikov\\'s colleagues on the Politburo traveled to the other Baltic states, ideology chief Vadim M. Medvedev to Latvia and Nikolai N. Slyunkov, who is in charge of formulating the party\\'s social and &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; policy, to Lithuania. Their arrivals were reported by state-run media in the Baltic republics, journalists there said. Later, the evening television news &lt;b&gt; program &lt;/b&gt; Vremya broadcast brief reports on the visits. Tass, the official news agency, said Medvedev outlined limits to political activity in meetings with workers at two factories in Riga, the Latvian capital. Tass said Latvians agreed with Medvedev on the need ``to subordinate group ambitions to the interests of society as a whole in the conditions of perestroika.\\'\\' However, during his visit to the Norma factory in Tallinn, Chebrikov heard Estonians object to elements of Gorbachev\\'s political &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; plan, Vremya said. The westward-looking Baltic republics, independent states until the Soviet Union absorbed them in 1940, have become a proving ground for bold &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; reforms that are part of Gorbachev\\'s drive for ``perestroika\\'\\' or restructuring. Granting a greater degree of autonomy to the small &lt;b&gt; republics &lt;/b&gt; on the Soviet Union\\'s western edge is fraught with political risks, since many residents resent Moscow\\'s control and some openly say their ultimate desire is complete independence. The Estonian Popular Front and a similar organization in Latvia have condemned Gorbachev\\'s political &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; plan, which is embodied in proposed amendments to the 1977 Constitution. The Lithuanian Restructuring Movement is to meet Sunday in Vilnius, the republic\\'s capital, to consider the issue. Members of the three popular fronts are now gathering signatures on petitions asking that the amendments be dropped and rewritten, Algimontas Vaishnoras of the Lithuanian group said in a telephone interview. The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, has scheduled a meeting on the political &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; issue for Wednesday, and Lithuania\\'s legislature will meet the next day. The 12-man Politburo, in a report on its Thursday night meeting, said authorities will consider changing the draft constitutional changes in response to more than 80,000 suggestions and comments from citizens and organizations. Friday night the Central Committee announced it would hold a special plenary meeting in mid-1989 to review policies dealing with the country\\'s more than 100 ethnic groups. ``The task of perfecting relations among nationalities is acquiring special importance and urgency,\\'\\' a Central Committee statement said according to Tass. &lt;/p&gt; 0.40124004566598  \\n   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday night closed a national Communist Party &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; on his &lt;b&gt; program &lt;/b&gt; of ``perestroika,\\'\\' saying resolutions endorsed by the delegates lead the way to a ``democratic image of socialism.\\'\\' The four-day conference, the first held by the party since 1941, was unprecedented in the openness of criticism of past and present leaders. Gorbachev pointed out one key to the four-day &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; _ the attempt to overcome the party\\'s Stalinist legacy _ when he called for construction of a monument to the victims Josef Stalin. ``I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be constructed in Moscow,\\'\\' he said in his closing address. ``This would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire Soviet people.\\'\\' Gorbachev spoke after the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; of 5,000 party members adopted resolutions in what the Tass news agency called an ``unusually stormy and long\\'\\' debate. The meeting, which was called by Gorbachev to pass judgment on his 3-year-old policy of restructuring Soviet society, formally closed after his address. The Soviet &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; also engaged in a long critique of the work of former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, who appealed earlier in the day to the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; to absolve him of blame for criticizing the pace of Gorbachev\\'s reforms last fall. That criticism cost Yeltsin his job and his spot as a candidate member of the ruling Politburo. Summing up the work of the conference, Gorbachev said, ``Through democratization, &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; and changes in the political system we willmake perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our society, a new human and democratic image of socialism.\\'\\' He called for the policy-making Central Committee and other organs to urgently settle questions related to political reforms so they can begin to be implemented at a fall session of the Supreme Soviet. Referring to his proposals to restructure the government\\'s legislative branch and give the president new powers, Gorbachev said ``the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system.\\'\\' Tass said the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; adopted a package of six resolutions, saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations and Gorbachev\\'s policy of ``glasnost,\\'\\' or more openness, were particularly thorny. It did not say what the resolutions said. The Tass report said there were several votes on amendments, and that the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; rejected proposals by space scientist Roald Sagdeyev on elections to government councils. An amendment calling for the Communist Party newspaper Pravda to be taken out of the hands of the policy-making Central Committee received only 56 votes, it said. Gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference. ``One of the heroes of our &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; was glasnost because our &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,\\'\\' he said. He called on the Soviet media to ``publicize the real achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,\\'\\' and proclaimed that no one has a monopoly on the truth. In an apparent reference to the time of Stalin, he said ``the printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.\\'\\' In contrast, he said the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; had showed how the interparty debate must be carried out. Before the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; debate ended, however, the long-simmering feud between Yeltsin and Kremlin No. 2 &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; Yegor K. Ligachev broke into the open. Yeltsin was judged as being politically mistaken by the party, but he said Friday his only mistake was poor timing. Gorbachev said Yeltsin was chosen to run the Moscow party organization because of his experience and energy, but ultimately proved he could not handle the job. Ligachev, at whom much of Yeltsin\\'s criticism was leveled, took the floor Friday evening to oppose his return, saying Yeltsin committed many errors and still hadn\\'t learned his lesson. The 57-year-old Yeltsin, a leading reformer and former protege of Gorbachev, was fired from his Moscow job as head of the Moscow Communist Party after he attacked the slow pace of &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; during a speech in October to the Central Committee. The speech has not been published. Yeltsin was reassigned as first deputy of the state construction committee, a ministerial-level post. He was dropped from the Politburo in February but retained sufficient status in the party to be chosen a delegate. ``I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early, before the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution,\\'\\' Yeltsin said. It was a time when the party was trying to display unity and celebrate its successes. ``Taking to heart what happened, I ask the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; to change the decision of the plenum of the Central Committee,\\'\\' Yeltsin told the delegates. ``If you find it possible to do this, you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of Communists.\\'\\' Yeltsin took the floor to answer questions from many delegates about the circumstances of his ouster and about his demand that Ligachev resign. He had told Western reporters during the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow that Ligachev was the party official most responsible for holding back Gorbachev\\'s reforms. Ligachev said Yeltsin had ``not drawn the necessary conclusions from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades.\\'\\' Other delegates also criticized Yeltsin, charging that he had been tactless on a visit abroad and gave interviews to foreign new agencies just to boost his own prestige. Some rose to Yeltsin\\'s defense in an open debate. Earlier Friday, the nation\\'s top environmental official demanded punishment for planners responsible for pollution disasters, and a reformist publisher defended the new openness of the press. At other times during the conference, delegates have openly disagreed on the concrete results of Gorbachev\\'s drive for perestroika, which was launched after he took power in March 1985. &lt;/p&gt; 0.354439941714667  \\n   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has won another political victory, gaining Communist Party approval to restructure the Politburo that once ruled the country. The Politburo now promises to play second fiddle to the separate government structure he also leads. The vote by the 28th Communist Party Congress on Monday also marks a new effort to reduce the ethnic unrest that is tearing the Soviet Union apart by including party leaders from the 15 Soviet &lt;b&gt; republics &lt;/b&gt; on the Politburo, the party\\'s ruling inner circle. The new body will have up to 23 members, nearly twice the 12 voting members on the old body, and many if not most of the faces should be new. The expansion and restructuring will accelerate the process that Gorbachev began after he was elected to a strengthened presidency in March, transferring power to a newly created Presidential Council _ a development that has angered such hard-line Politburo members as Yegor K. Ligachev and could squeeze them out of their jobs. Unlike the Politburo, whose members are elected by the party, members of the Presidential Council are appointed and dismissed by the president, along the lines of a Western-style cabinet. The Politburo, which formerly met once every Thursday, has been meeting only once a month since March, and has been concentrating on Communist Party rather than government issues. Since most of the Politburo members will reside in their home republics, the Politburo will continue to meet relatively infrequently and will not exercise as tight control over national affairs as the body has traditionally done. The duties of the government council have not been fully defined. The 16-man body consists of six voting members of the Politburo, including the prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister, the KGB chief, and Gorbachev\\'s right-hand man, Alexander Yakovlev. Other members are the chief law enforcement official, a reform-minded economist, a crusading environmentalist and a workers\\' rights activist. Significantly, whereas nine of 12 men on the old Politburo were members of the ethnic Russian majority, the new Politburo will include a majority of non-Russians. And the Presidential Council contains five non-Russians. The new Politburo will include the heads of the party organizations in the 15 republics, most of whom are clamoring for greater control over political and &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; decisions affecting their regions. Shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist Party five years ago, Gorbachev sought to centralize his authority, but he has been driven to support greater regional autonomy by the independence drives of the three Baltic republics. Moreover, the largest Soviet republic, the Russian Federation, last month proclaimed its intent to seek greater control of its affairs under the leadership of its populist Communist president, Boris N. Yeltsin. Mostly recently, Gorbachev has embraced the idea of reconstituting the Soviet Union as a looser confederation of republics. The Politburo has had its ups and downs since it was created on the eve of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that swept the Communists to power. The first two Soviet leaders, Vladimir I. Lenin and Josef V. Stalin, exercised virtual one man rule, appointing aides and allies to the Politburo. Under Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled for 18 years until his death in 1982, the Politburo was a coalition that made all the key decisions. As Brezhnev and the other Politburo members weakened with age, the country lapsed into what Gorbachev has labeled the period of stagnation. The first Politburo consisted of seven Bolsheviks, among them Lenin, the founder of the Red Army Leon Trotsky, and the lesser-known Stalin. Following Lenin\\'s death in 1924, Stalin eliminated Trotsky and other rivals from the ruling body. By the height of his power in 1952, he had expanded the membership to 25 voting members, all loyal aides. It also included 11 non-voting members. Nikita S. Khrushchev, who rose to power after Stalin\\'s death in 1953, whittled the body to 15 voting and nine non-voting members. Although he instituted reforms, he tried to keep a tight personal grip on power, angering Politburo colleagues who tried unsuccessfully to oust him in 1957 and succeeded in 1964. Brezhnev, Khrushchev\\'s successor, used the Politburo to forge a coalition among Soviet interest groups, such as the armed forces, the KGB, other government ministries and major industrial sectors, who held most of the dozen slots. He also included seven heads of &lt;b&gt; republic &lt;/b&gt; parties as non-voting Politburo members, allowing them to run their regions in return for loyalty. Gorbachev and his allies argue that Brezhnev\\'s system led to widescale corruption and blocked the transformation of the country into a modern industrial society. &lt;/p&gt; 0.35324437702244  \\n   Lithuania on Saturday proposed that its parliament compromise with the Kremlin and impose a moratorium on its declaration of independence, officials said. The proposal from the republic\\'s Council of Ministers appeared to coincide with a compromise offered Tuesday by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the official news agency Tass said it ``could mark the beginning of the solution of all the so-called `Lithuanian problems.\\'\\'\\' Also Saturday, Soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a fertilizer plant in Lithuania, partly easing the 2-month-old blockade of fuel they imposed to pressure the Baltic &lt;b&gt; republic &lt;/b&gt; into renouncing its March 11 declaration of independence. The Lithuanian government suggested the declaration remain valid but its implementation be frozen while negotiations were under way with Moscow, said Algis Cekuolis, a consultant for the Baltic republic. However, Cekuolis said it was unclear whether the compromise would have enough support to be passed by the republic\\'s legislature, which will probably consider it Monday. ``It will be received in parliament by very strong opposition,\\'\\' he predicted. The Lithuanian government, under Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, is considered far more disposed to compromise with the Kremlin than the parliament, which is led by President Vytautas Landsbergis and dominated by members of the pro-independence Sajudis popular front. Gorbachev proposed compromises Tuesday in a meeting with the leaders of the three secessionist Baltic states. He told the national Supreme Soviet legislature earlier that day that ``if Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of independence, we may start to talk. That means suspend its implementation at least for the duration of the talks.\\'\\' Saturday\\'s proposal by the Lithuanian Council of Ministers suggested exactly that, government spokesmen said. ``Our act of independence would remain valid,\\'\\' said council spokesman Gentaras Jatkonis. ``But we are postponing the realization of it.\\'\\' Similar proposals have gone back and forth between the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius and Moscow in telegrams and informal talks ``like a ping-pong game\\'\\' for weeks but ``this is the first time it\\'s on an official level,\\'\\' Cekuolis said. A spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament, Aidas Palubinskas, said he was told on Saturday by a pipeline dispatcher that natural gas was again flowing from the Soviet Union to the Azotas fertilizer plant in the city of Jonova. ``The plant will be getting 3.5 million cubic meters daily,\\'\\' Palubinskas was told by dispatcher Alexander Mishikov. Restoration of the gas supply fulfilled a promise made to Mrs. Prunskiene on Wednesday by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov that 15 percent of the republic\\'s daily natural gas supply would be restored. Politburo member Yuri D. Maslyukov told a news &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; in Moscow on Friday that the restoration of fuel to the Lithuanian plant was a goodwill gesture from the Kremlin and a ``reiteration of the Soviet government\\'s interest in speeding negotiations.\\'\\' More than 26,000 people have lost their jobs because of the Kremlin\\'s blockade of all oil, most natural gas and some raw materials. Palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the Azotas plant would mean 1,600 employees could return to work by the end of this week. At the beachfront resort of Jurmala in Latvia, leaders of the popular fronts of Latvia and Estonia and the Sajudis movement of Lithuania opened a &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; to discuss the future of their movements under democratically elected governments. The delegates, 50 from each of the pro-independence movements, condemned the &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; sanctions against Lithuania and discussed ways of increasing cooperation among the Baltic states and with other Soviet republics, Tass reported. ``Nobody has a right to demand either abrogation or halting the acts of independence,\\'\\' Tass quoted delegates as saying. ``A retreat will harm the democratic movement.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.351544221361977  \\n   Thousands of people went on strike in the capital of Armenia, apparently unhappy over the Armenian leadership\\'s presentation of an ethnic dispute at the national Communist Party conference, a newspaper said Tuesday. The Soviet government daily Izvestia said the strike began Monday, one day after ``many thousands\\'\\' of people met in the Theater Square of Yerevan, the capital of the southern republic. Most flights in and out of Yerevan were canceled, it said. In a Tuesday edition, Izvestia said: ``Like yesterday a series of the city\\'s industrial concerns aren\\'t working, or are working with less than a full work force.\\'\\' It said food stores and industries, as well as restaurants and medical services had been working Monday. The newspaper said farm work was going on in Stepanakert, the largest city of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, but that many other industries and institutions there also were shut down. Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of a territorial dispute between Armenia and the neighboring &lt;b&gt; republic &lt;/b&gt; of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but the mountain enclave\\'s predominantly Armenian population has been agitating since February to be annexed to Armenia. Armenia supports the demand. Azerbaijan is against it. At least 32 people were killed in riots over annexation which broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, at the end of February. Izvestia said the thousands of people who gathered on the Yerevan city square Sunday listened to a television broadcast by delegates to the four-day party &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; in Moscow, which closed last Friday. Armenian party &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; Suren Arutyunyan said in remarks broadcast on Soviet TV during the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; that authorities could not normalize the situation in Armenia, where large demonstrations frequently have occurred in support of Nagorno-Karabakh\\'s demand. He proposed that the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; take up unspecified amendments to the Soviet constitution. The disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan has sent the issue to national authorities, and the constitution specifies no way to solve the dispute. Delegates who spoke on television supported Arutyunyan\\'s call for restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd. But Izvestia said that after a ``stormy debate\\'\\' on the square, a committee was formed that called for a general strike after laying down a series of demands, including a quick, favorable resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The committee demanded that the Soviet Supreme Court take over the trials of those charged in the Sumgait violence and demanded full information about the alleged poisoning of workers at a factory in the town of Masis. Izvestia provided no more information about the Masis incident, except to say an investigation was under way. The party &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; called for greater attention to republics\\' calls for &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; autonomy, but said authorities would not tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic tensions. Besides Azerbaijan and Armenia, delegates from the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also brought up ethnic questions at the conference. About a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three Estonian political prisoners had gathered more than 6,000 signatures by Tuesday during a five-day demonstration in Tallinn, Estonia. ``We will continue the demonstration until they are freed or until the authorities give us an exact date for their release,\\'\\' Eve Parnaste said as she carried a poster at the protest outside the Estonian Supreme Court building. She said the three prisoners had been demanding publication of a secret 1939 pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that placed the Baltic &lt;b&gt; republics &lt;/b&gt; of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia under Moscow\\'s control. All three were arrested this year, charged with spreading anti-Soviet propaganda or slandering the Soviet state. Miss Parnaste\\'s poster said, ``KGB is an evil empire,\\'\\' using the initials for the Soviet secret police. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  national part support major past give issue policy recent plan change committee action include special important provide future position situation &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.295860340432342  \\n   Here is a text of President Bush\\'s news conference Thursday: President Bush: Well I have a brief statement and then I\\'ll be glad to take some questions. The United States is engaged in a collective effort involving the overwhelming majority of the member states of the United Nations to reverse the consequences of Iraqi aggression. And our goals, enshrined in five Security Council resolutions, are clear: the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of Kuwait\\'s legitimate government, the stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, and the protection of American citizens. What is at stake here is truly significant _ the dependability of America\\'s commitments to its friends and allies, the shape of the post-postwar world, opposition to aggression, the potential domination of the energy resources that are crucial to the entire world. This effort has been truly international from the very outset. Many other countries are contributing. At last count, 22 countries have either responded to a request from Saudi Arabia to help deter further aggression, or are contributing maritime forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 665. And still others are providing other forms of financial and material &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; to these defense efforts or to countries whose economies are affected adversely by sanctions or by higher oil prices. And still others are paying a heavy economic price at home for complying with the United Nations sanctions. It is &lt;b&gt; important &lt;/b&gt; that the considerable burden of the effort be shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free flow of oil. Indeed, anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in ensuring that all of us succeed. The United States has large interests in the balance and has undertaken commitments commensurate with them, and we\\'re more than willing to bear our fair share of the burden. This includes above all the thousands of men and women in our armed forces who are now in the Gulf, but we also expect others to bear their fair share. A number of countries already have announced their willingness to help those adversely affected economically by this endeavor. And it\\'s essential, though, that this be a concerted and coordinated one and that all affected countries participate. It is &lt;b&gt; important &lt;/b&gt; to get the priorities right and make sure that those most deserving of assistance receive it and that those most able to contribute do so. And for that reason, I directed an interagency effort to develop a strategy to accomplish this objective. The group\\'s report was presented at yesterday\\'s National Security Council meeting here, and this morning I approved an &lt;b&gt; action &lt;/b&gt; plan. And our approach calls for substantial economic assistance to those states _ in particular, I\\'d single out Turkey and Egypt, who are bearing a great &lt;b&gt; part &lt;/b&gt; of the burden of sanctions and higher oil prices. The &lt;b&gt; plan &lt;/b&gt; also targets additional countries, including Jordan, the countries of Eastern Europe and others for &lt;b&gt; special &lt;/b&gt; assistance. The United States will also seek burdensharing for &lt;b&gt; part &lt;/b&gt; of our own effort. At the same time, we will be asking other governments, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Federal Republic of Germany, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, free Kuwait, and others to join us in making available financial and, where appropriate, energy resources to countries that have been most affected by the current situation. To facilitate this undertaking, I\\'ve asked Secretary of State Jim Baker and the Secretary of the Treasury Nick Brady to lead high-level delegations to the Persian Gulf, Europe and Asia. And I\\'ll be getting directly in touch with the leaders of these countries before Secretaries Baker and Brady arrive to set forth, spell out our general objectives. Let me close by repeating what I said the other day in meeting with the congressional leaders. The basic pieces of our &lt;b&gt; policy &lt;/b&gt; are in place. The Iraqi regime stands in opposition to the entire world and to the interests of the Iraqi people. It is truly Iraq against the world. But I want to make this point clear, we have no argument with the people of Iraq. The sanctions are beginning to take hold. And in the meantime, we want to ensure that countries contributing to this unprecedented collective response do not suffer for doing so. And what I\\'ve announced today and what I expect will be implemented in the coming days should help create a context in which sanctions against Iraq can be sustained with the intended effect. Another area where there has been unprecedented international solidarity is OPEC\\'s willingness to take up the slack in oil production created by the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwait\\'s oil. In this connection, I met this morning with our energy advisers who are watching the oil production &lt;b&gt; situation &lt;/b&gt; very, very closely. And we are pleased with OPEC\\'s decision to help take up the slack in crude oil production. And although we are in what I would see as a transition period, the &lt;b&gt; situation &lt;/b&gt; appears manageable. At the present time, we don\\'t anticipate &lt;b&gt; major &lt;/b&gt; imbalances in the oil market. But we do have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve tested and available if it is truly needed. And our energy &lt;b&gt; policy &lt;/b&gt; is resulting in increased oil production and fuel switching to natural gas and to other fuels. I also repeat my previous request for Americans to conserve and for all parties to act responsibly. Right now, the situation, I would say, is relative stable, and I am very pleased by the coordination that has taken place with so many countries in maintaining adequate fuel levels.

The European Community and its member states have consistently followed developments in South Africa with the greatest attention and have given a favorable reception to the initiatives which have been to bring about the abolition of apartheid and the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. They have already expressed approval of the results of the talks between the government and the ANC (African National Congress), in particular those of the Pretoria meeting in August which opened the way to the negotiation of a new constitution. They deplore the phase of serious violence through which South Africa is passing, which may endanger these developments. They welcome, however, further indications serving to confirm that the process of &lt;b&gt; change &lt;/b&gt; already begun is going ahead in the direction advocated by the Strasbourg European Council. They have decided to continue to encourage this process. Against this background, the European Council has decided that as soon as legislative &lt;b&gt; action &lt;/b&gt; is taken by the African government to repeal the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, the Community and its member states will proceed to an easing of the set of measures adopted in 1986. As of now, so as to contribute to combating unemployment and improving the economic and social &lt;b&gt; situation &lt;/b&gt; in South Africa, and to encourage the movement under way aimed at the complete abolition of apartheid, the European Council has decided to lift the ban on new investments. At the same time, the Community and its member states, with the objective of sending a clear message of political &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; to the victims of apartheid, and intending to contribute to a new economic and social balance in South Africa, have agreed to strengthen the program of positive measures and to adapt it to the requirements of the new situation, including requirements related to the return and resettlement of the exiles. The Community and its member states hope in this way to be able to contribute to the speeding up of the process under way through sending to all the parties involved in negotiations a concrete sign of &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; for the establishment of a new South Africa, united, non-racial and democratic and capable of resuming the place which it deserves in the international community. &lt;/p&gt; 0.272641028930976  \\n   The Federal Communications Commission has decided to relax its rule on ownership of more than one radio station. The new rule would allow commonly owned stations to be as close as 25 miles apart, as long as they are in different markets. The rule would reduce by about half the distance required between two stations owned by the same person or company, and it would allow common ownership of stations in adjacent markets. The FCC said the new rule will enable more station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that result from common ownership of stations. The FCC also agreed to recommend that Congress require cable companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights to carry their signals. The commission is expected to extend that recommendation to cover local TV signals before it issues a final order in the matter. &lt;/p&gt; 0.272405528356638  \\n   ``It is a magnitude that no one in their wildest imagination or scientific predictions could have suggested.\\'\\' _ Yellowstone National Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo, discussing a complex of wildfires. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  building project center space built site museum heart build construction cost buildings hotel atlanta device approval artifacts projects tower jarvik &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.486027145015763  \\n   Thousands of relics left by a lost Indian tribe in the ruins of their famed cliff houses were methodically looted before the turn of the century. Now a band of ``reverse archaeologists\\'\\' wants to bring them home. Before Congress outlawed the practice in 1905, collecting baskets, pots, tools and other everyday household items from Anasazi Indian ruins was a thrilling romp through history for explorers hired by East Coast collectors. Like the swashbuckling treasure hunter in the ``Indiana Jones\\'\\' movies, they took the ancient ruins of a culture that vanished before Europeans reached the New World. Most of the loot eventually found its way into &lt;b&gt; museum &lt;/b&gt; display cases. Large collections are housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Museum of the American Indian in New York, among others. But a group of volunteer researchers is eager to bring them home to the Four Corners area of the Southwest where the Anasazi pioneered farming and &lt;b&gt; built &lt;/b&gt; dense communities hundreds of feet high in scenic cliffsides. Julia Johnson, the director of the volunteer Wetherill-Grand Gulch researchers, decried the looting at a recent symposium on the early Anasazis, known as the Basketmakers, in Blanding, Utah. The group wants to reverse the actions of 1890s explorers and return the &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; to museums as close to the ruins from which they were taken as possible. To help achieve that and to help scientists study the Anasazi, 5,000 pages of documents and 500 photographs have been compiled on the &lt;b&gt; museum &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; to trace their origins. Since many of the early-day explorers kept meticulous diaries, ``it\\'s possible in some cases to identify exactly which hole something came out of,\\'\\' said Fred Blackburn, a biologist who joined the ``reverse archaeologists.\\'\\' Blackburn, 40, and his colleagues crawl through Grand Gulch in Utah, about 100 miles west of Cortez, searching for signatures the explorers carved into cliff walls. By matching the individual &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; on display in Eastern museums with the diaries, Blackburn\\'s group can supply a research base for scientists studying the Basketmaker era of the Anasazi, he said. The ruins were virtually cleared out and their treasures carted off by the time Congress forbade the practice in 1905, Blackburn said. ``And the expeditions weren\\'t real researchers,\\'\\' said Blackburn, whose wife, Victoria Atkins, is an archaeologist. ``There\\'s so much we don\\'t know about the Basketmakers.\\'\\' The Basketmaker Anasazis lived in the area from about the time of Christ until the year 700, Blackburn said. They are believed to be the farming pioneers of the tribe that &lt;b&gt; built &lt;/b&gt; a thriving civiliation in the famous cliff houses of Mesa Verde National Park. Their Pueblo Anasazi descendants disappeared from the area, apparently driven by a long drought, in about 1300. ``We\\'re putting this together so researchers can go back and find out what the origins of these people were, their customs, where they came from and where they went,\\'\\' Blackburn said. He started with the diary of Charles Cary Graham, who with Charles McLoyd began excavating Grand Gulch in 1890. The pair met Richard Wetherill and Charlie Mason just as the latter two were riding out after discovering the landmark Balcony House at Mesa Verde. Wetherill, a nearby rancher and amateur archaeologist, hired Graham and McLoyd to bring &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; from Grand Gulch to the local historical society. The collection later ended up at the Field Museum in Chicago. As news of the rich ruins spread, other expeditions followed, explorers erasing clues to the mysterious Anasazi\\'s past in their diligence to gather prized artifacts. One likely &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; for any relics returned to the region would be the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores, a town north of Cortez. Initial efforts will try to arrange artifact loans, with the eventual goal of establishing permanent exhibits, volunteers said. Fund-raising is under way to pay for lobbying visits to museums that house large Anasazi collections. Blackburn, who specializes in studies of Bighorn sheep, says his strong ties to the Four Corners area prompted his ``reverse archaeology\\'\\' work. He\\'s especially fascinated with evidence of the Anasazis ability to co-exist with the sheep that used to roam the area in large numbers. The fledgling ``reverse archaeolgist\\'\\' movement _ looking for &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; in museums to bring them back to historic sites, rather than the other way around _could provide clues to true archaeologists enabling them to unravel the mystery surrounding the demise of the Anasazi, he said. ``Archaeology is really pretty new here in southwest Colorado,\\'\\' he said. ``And there hasn\\'t been much done on the Basketmakers. ``There are a lot of parallels between the Anasazi and what we have today. Overpopulation and drought were a major problem for them and many archaeologists think that\\'s what drove them out of here. Overpopulation and drought are big problems for us, too.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.469916214218051  \\n   A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and nondescript. Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; planned for downtown Atlanta. Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the 50-story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is a slender, post-modern &lt;b&gt; tower &lt;/b&gt; of stone with tall arched entryways and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high, eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern. Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words like ``gracious,\\'\\' ``truly wonderful,\\'\\' ``serene,\\'\\' ``imposing\\'\\' and ``glamorous\\'\\' to describe the tower. ``It certainly &lt;b&gt; projects &lt;/b&gt; a vibrance to the rest of the world,\\'\\' said Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development with the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ``It\\'s just beautiful. Everybody\\'s just staggered by it.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; tower &lt;/b&gt; is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of the city\\'s tallest buildings. Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going up in Atlanta, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper complex was altered to complement the rose-colored IBM tower. New York architect John Burgee, whose firm designed the IBM &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; with design consultant Philip Johnson, won\\'t take credit for transforming Atlanta\\'s skyline. But he said the city\\'s image, as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change. ``Atlanta has been looking for its identity,\\'\\' Burgee said in a telephone interview from his New York office. ``It\\'s an historical city (but) its architecture and image is not strictly historical. You think of Atlanta and you think of `Gone With The Wind.\\' Now, there is an attempt to come up with a visual image. ``We all know Peachtree Street, but you don\\'t think of its buildings,\\'\\' he said. ``Like in New York, the Empire State Building; Chicago, the Sears building; San Francisco, the TransAmerica building. Atlanta doesn\\'t have that. It\\'s moving toward that, very definitely.\\'\\' Burgee and Johnson also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown Atlanta. Another planned &lt;b&gt; project &lt;/b&gt; grouped in the ``Son of IBM\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section, a complex of three office &lt;b&gt; buildings &lt;/b&gt; and a &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; being developed by AT&amp;T and the Atlanta-based Landmarks Group. When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the excitement over the nearby IBM Tower, its architects, Thompson, Ventulett &amp; Stainback, redrew the plans to use rose glass above rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire. The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by Portman, whose imprint is already deeply felt in Atlanta, primarily through the Peachtree Center and the towering cylindrical Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. Portman\\'s new &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; is slated to begin &lt;b&gt; construction &lt;/b&gt; next year and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One Atlantic as the Southeast\\'s tallest building. Unveiling the design in May, Portman said it was ``respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern architecture.\\'\\' Dale Durfee, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech, said completion of the IBM &lt;b&gt; tower &lt;/b&gt; signaled the acceleration of a change in the look of the city that began a decade ago. ``Atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla,\\'\\' he said, ``with no development of architectural significance.\\'\\' Burgee echoed that appraisal, saying, ``It was pretty nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you (to Atlanta) blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you wouldn\\'t have a clue where you are.\\'\\' Durfee said that 10 years ago, Atlanta was groping to form an identity and had no demand for the type of &lt;b&gt; buildings &lt;/b&gt; now are going up. Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office buildings, Durfee said, and corporate sponsorship of &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; projects &lt;/b&gt; has changed the rules of skyscraper financing. Some say that all the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; activity simply makes good business sense. ``Sure, there\\'s competitive prestige. Good architecture is good business,\\'\\' said Truman Hartshorn, chairman of the geography department at Georgia State University and a specialist in urban affairs. A good-looking building, he said, ``is easier to sell to the financing people as well as the tenants.\\'\\' Hartshorn said he expects the new &lt;b&gt; projects &lt;/b&gt; in Atlanta will bring special recognition. ``I think it\\'s going to open some eyes,\\'\\' he said. ``We have prestige with our cultural buildings, but I don\\'t know that our office &lt;b&gt; buildings &lt;/b&gt; are that distinctive nationally. ``These aren\\'t just ultra post-modern. They\\'re classic. They\\'re different.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.438359862371807  \\n   The &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; of living in Fairfield County is among the highest in the country, but the &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; of dying has become pricey, too. To make matters worse, burial plots are running out. Most cemeteries, where single plots can &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; $1,000 and more, are likely to be filled within 10 or 15 years, according to funeral home and cemetery managers. ``Cemeteries are going to become a thing of the past,\\'\\' said William E. Magner Jr., who manages Willowbrook Cemetery in Westport. Harriet Steuber, president of a group that administers Union Cemetery of Norwalk, said that once &lt;b&gt; space &lt;/b&gt; runs out, ``I guess we\\'ll all have to be cremated and dumped in the sound,\\'\\' referring to Long Island Sound, the stretch of ocean off the Connecticut coast. ``I don\\'t like to think about it. It gives me the creeps,\\'\\' Steuber said. One solution may lie above ground. Mausoleums up to four stories high are becoming increasingly common in the region. Construction of one such facility by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport began this month at Darien\\'s St. John\\'s Cemetery. ``It\\'s one of the, shall we say, contemporary modes of burial to help meet the lack of space,\\'\\' said Monsignor Nicholas B. Grieco. The structures are often multistory units containing hallways lined with crypts. Each floor might contain up to 100 bodies. ``Think of it as a giant bookcase with slots,\\'\\' Magner said. But mausoleums are not cost-savers. They are generally more expensive than below-ground burial, Grieco said. Other cemetery managers say mausoleum interment is about twice the price of traditional burial. Sometimes it\\'s possible to economize. At St. John\\'s Cemetery in Norwalk, a two-grave plot can be used for four individuals _ one on top of another. The practice is allowed at the discretion of the cemetery, which charges $1,050 for the double plots. But the &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; of the grave &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; is only the start. Add to that payments to the cemetery for digging the grave and the price of a concrete vault, plus a foundation for a gravestone and it could &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; as much as $2,000. Cremation, which one local funeral director said now accounts for about 30 percent of his business, can save several hundred dollars at the funeral home and there would be no cemetery costs. Basic cremation and transporation services can &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; as little as $160. &lt;/p&gt; 0.431739320901043  \\n   One of the last persons to receive a Jarvik artifical &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; before federal &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; was withdrawn died after surgery to replace the pump with a donor organ. He spent 87 days on the device. Carl E. Bryant, 43, of Louisville, died Wednesday, eight hours after the transplant operation, said doctors at Louisville\\'s Jewish Hospital. ``We did everything we could for Carl Bryant,\\'\\' said Dr. Laman A. Gray Jr., who transplanted the heart. Physicians said the donor heart, which became available late Tuesday, met the criteria for transplantation. But the left ventricle, or main pumping chamber, failed to function once the &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; was inside Bryant. The Jarvik 7-70 assist &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; was implanted Dec. 22 at Humana Hospital-Audubon by Dr. William DeVries, who pioneered use of the artificial heart. ``The transplant surgery offered Carl\\'s only real chance for survival,\\'\\' DeVries said in a statement Wednesday. Bryant was the second-to-last person to receive a Jarvik pump in this country before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew its &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; Jan. 8, said Gary Cole, an executive vice president with Symbion Inc., the Arizona manufacturer of the pumps. The agency said its inspections uncovered ``serious deficiencies\\'\\' in the way Symbion was carrying out studies with the device. In February, the FDA said it would allow use of the &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; as a last resort, but only when all other available treatments had failed and when no other life-saving &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; could be used. The &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; was last implanted in the United States in Columbus, Ohio, on Dec. 31, Cole said Thursday. He said two Jarvik pumps have been implanted in other countries since the FDA withdrawal. Cole said 159 Jarviks have been implanted as bridges to transplants since 1985. He said the longest-surviving patient to use the Jarvik while awaiting a donor organ was a French woman. She lived 603 days on the device. Dr. Barney Clark, the first person implanted with a Jarvik heart, died in 1983 after 112 days on the device. He received a Jarvik-7, which was supposed to be a premanent replacement for his heart. Bryant had a massive &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; attack in July and underwent cardiac catheterization and angioplastic surgery in his left coronary artery. His wife, Cynthia, took him to the hospital Dec. 16 after he complained of chest pains. Three hours before he was to undergo triple bypass surgery, Bryant suffered a second massive &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; attack. DeVries implanted the Jarvik &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; during a six-hour procedure. ``I have no qualms about Carl being on the assist &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; at all,\\'\\' Cynthia Bryant said. ``It worked wonderfully and may further research to help someone else. And we had three good months together that we would not have had otherwise.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.428420640878955  \\n   Proponents of artificial hearts fear the Food and Drug Administration\\'s withdrawal of &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; for the Jarvik &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; could hurt research toward a totally implantable device, but most see it as a temporary setback. And they don\\'t believe the action will have a serious impact on &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; patients because other temporary heart-assist devices still are available as a bridge to a &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; transplant. ``It is a shame because the Jarvik, for its limitation, did make some positive contributions,\\'\\' said Dr. Antonio Gotto, chief of internal medical services at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and past president of the American Heart Association. ``I hope this will be only a temporary, not a permanent, setback toward the goal of achieving a totally implantable heart.\\'\\' The FDA informed Symbion Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., this week that it was withdrawing &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; for continued investigational uses of its artificial heart, both as a permanent replacement and a temporary bridge for patients awaiting a human &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; transplant. The Jarvik heart, named after its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik, gained household recognition after it was implanted in Barney Clark on Dec. 2, 1982. He lived 112 days, his new &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; tethered to a bulky external power system, before he succumbed to multiple organ failure. In revoking Symbion\\'s approval, the FDA said it had found ``serious deficiencies\\'\\' in manufacturing quality control, monitoring of research sites, servicing of equipment, training of personnel and reporting of adverse reactions to FDA. Dr. Donald Olsen, director of the University of Utah\\'s Institute for Biomedical Engineering, said he was ``surprised and disappointed\\'\\' by the FDA\\'s action and hoped it would not hurt future federal funding of artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; research in general, particularly for totally implantable devices. ``Our concern, of course, is that this particular publicity will not have a negative influence\\'\\' on artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; development in general, said Olsen. ``But I would like to make sure (people know) that the artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; did not fail; it was a failure on the part of Symbion to meet the requirements of the FDA\\'\\' for improving the device. Gerson Rosenberg, a biomedical engineer who leads Pennsylvania State University\\'s efforts to design an electric heart, said he did not think the decision to pull the Jarvik would hinder research. But others felt the decision could slow research in the field. ``By removing the Jarvik, you take the first and main artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; player out of the ballgame,\\'\\' said Dr. Jacob Kolff, who heads Temple University\\'s efforts to develop the temporary ``Philadelphia Heart.\\'\\' ``That leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think there may be a future for an artificial heart,\\'\\' said the surgeon, whose father, Dr. Willem Kolff, developed the first artificial kidney in 1943. Withdrawal of the permanent Jarvik &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; leaves only one other natural-heart replacement with FDA investigational approval, but that &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; is used only as a temporary bridge and only at Hershey Medical Center of Penn State. Other companies have approvals for temporary implants and for left ventricular assist pumps that help the natural &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; work without replacement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  market stock index exchange trading points stocks rose jones shares million dow average issues volume wall york unchanged board big &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.866173563713779  \\n   The Dow Jones &lt;b&gt; average &lt;/b&gt; of 30 industrials closed down 13.29 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; to 2,583.56.

The delegation\\'s four members made no statement upon arriving at the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut. However, a committee source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the four planned to maintain ``daily presence in Sidon this week, waiting for a contact concerning our two &lt;b&gt; kidnapped &lt;/b&gt; colleagues.\\'\\' The team was led by the Red Cross chief delegate in Lebanon, Michel Dufour, and the committee\\'s spokeswoman for the Middle East, Marjolaine Martin, who flew into Beirut from Geneva on Wednesday. ``We remain optimistic after our &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; here about the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of our two officials,\\'\\' Dufour said, without elaborating. The delegation is seeking the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of Red Cross orthopedic technicians Emanuel Christen, 33, and Elio Erriquez, 24. They were &lt;b&gt; kidnapped &lt;/b&gt; by unidentified gunmen in Sidon on Oct. 6. No group claims responsibility for their seizure. However, Lebanese and foreign security sources blame the Fatah-Revolutionary Council group of Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal. The group has denied involvement and urged the captors to &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; Christen and Erriquez. The Red Cross team &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; on Thursday with Mustafa Saad, who heads the Sunni Moslem independent Nasserite organization whose 1,000-strong Popular Liberation Army militia dominates Sidon. Saad renewed his appeal for the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of the two Red Cross workers, saying failure to free them ``will be considered a hostile act against us.\\'\\' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, as well as Palestinian and Lebanese groups, have appealed for the pair\\'s release.

U.N. officials said Georges Vassiliou, president of the Republic of Cyprus, and Rauf Denktash, president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, will visit New York for &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; Aug. 24. ``The leaders of the two sides in Cyprus have accepted my proposal for resumption of &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; to negotiate a settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem,\\'\\' Perez de Cuellar said in a brief news conference. He did not elaborate on his proposals for peace in Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkish troops invaded in 1974 and captured the northern third of the island. Turkish Cypriots, who comprise one-fifth of the island\\'s 650,000 people, have formed their own breakaway state, headed by Denktash, in the Turkish- controlled territory. Several rounds of &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; between Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders, under U.N. mediation, have failed to resolve disputes over the form of a federation and withdrawal of about 29,000 Turkish troops. &lt;/p&gt; 0.341912830507224  \\n   Thousands of Iranians gathered at the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\\'s tomb Thursday, the 11th anniversary of his return from exile, and his son preached continued hostility to America, Tehran &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; said. On the first anniversary since the revolutionary patriarch\\'s death June 3, Ahmad Khomeini said his father, known as the Imam, constantly defied ``global arrogance,\\'\\' an Iranian phrase for United States and its allies. ``We must always remain on the Imam\\'s path,\\'\\' he said at a ceremony beginning a 10-day celebration of the Islamic revolution. Ahmad Khomeini said his father warned that, ``if we show the slightest bit of complacency, America will deliver its final blow against us. You, the people, must prepare for struggle against America.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; the younger Khomeini, a leading radical, praised his father\\'s successor as spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for ``treading the same path as the Imam.\\'\\' His exhortation for no compromise with the United States was seen as a warning to President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatist faction in Iran. Rafsanjani, who attended the ceremony Khomeini\\'s golden-domed tomb in the Behesht Zahra cemetery, seeks better relations with the West in order to obtain help in recovering from eight years of war with Iraq. The first part of Rafsanjani\\'s 5-year development plan, calling for up to $20 billion in foreign investment, got Parliament\\'s approval Wednesday over opposition from radicals who want state control and no foreign involvement. Tehran television showed throngs at the cemetery chanting ``Death to America!\\'\\' and ``Death to Israel!\\'\\' Iranian officials paid their respects at the tomb and promised to safeguard Khomeini\\'s ideological legacy, the &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; said. ``At a time when the government was in the hands of the enemy, the Imam\\'s coming from a safe place to the center of the danger was an act rooted in the immense power of the Lord,\\'\\' Rafsanjani said at the graveside, the &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; reported. Khomeini returned from 14 years of exile Feb. 1, 1979, after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced to flee. Ten days later, the government he left behind collapsed and Khomeini proclaimed the Islamic republic, Rafsanjani said: ``The Iranian people have proved that if a nation is resolute in its stand, and if it has courage and spirit, it cannot be defeated.\\'\\' He said recent changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere were ``a small example of what the people of Iran achieved 11 years ago, and these popular rebellions are the legacy of the people of Iran.\\'\\' Khamenei, the nation\\'s spiritual leader, told another gathering in Tehran: ``The future belongs to Islam, the Moslems and the freedom-loving nations of the world,\\'\\' the television reported. ``In the confrontation with the organizations of the satanic powers (the West), it will be Islam which triumphs.\\'\\' Despite the fiery rhetoric, this year\\'s anniversary of the revolution differs from past observances. It reflects the more more relaxed character of Rafsanjani\\'s government, formed in August, and an easing of Islamic rigidity. While Khomeini was alive, the anniversary was a time of rallies to show support for him, and of reruns on state television of bloody clashes between revolutionary zealots and the shah\\'s forces. On Thursday, television showed film of Khomeini arriving in Tehran in 1979 on a chartered Air France jet, but comedy and children\\'s shows dominated the morning programming. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said music would be part of the celebrations this year for the first time. Khomeini felt good Moslems should shun music. &lt;/p&gt; 0.329791664560139  \\n   An Iranian official said both presidential candidates have asked Iran for help securing the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; in Lebanon. Hussein Sheikholeslam, a deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, spoke at a news conference late Thursday in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, where he stopped en route to Kenya. He said Republican candidate George Bush and Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis made contact with Iran through third parties, including governments and individuals. Bush has denied this, and officials in Washington insist the United States has no direct or indirect contacts with the Iranians. Sheikholeslam said the identity of the intermediaries is ``a touchy question\\'\\' and that he did not want to get involved ``in the election games of the United States.\\'\\' But he said the contacts were not at the level of those conducted in 1986 that led to the Irangate scandal, in which arms were secretly sold to Iran. He did not elaborate. Sheikholeslam stressed that normalizing relations with the United States should be separated from the issue of the &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; in Lebanon. Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem militants are believed to hold most of the 14 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Nine of the captives are American. The longest &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was &lt;b&gt; kidnapped &lt;/b&gt; March 16, 1985. Sheikholeslam said Iran also was concerned about four Iranians who have been missing in Lebanon for six years. He said that while Iran was appealing for the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of its nationals, it was not necessarily linking their fate to that of the 14 Westerners. Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who lives in exile in Paris, said recently that Richard Lawless, a former U.S. official, negotiated with Iranian government representatives on behalf of Bush for the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of the American hostages. In Washington on Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied again that the U.S. government was negotiating with Iran. Fitzwater took issue with a report Friday in The Nation, a Jerusalem weekly, that &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; on the &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; but recessed because of news leaks. ``No one is authorized to talk for the (U.S.) government,\\'\\' he said. ``As we have said before, there are all kinds of people around the world freelancing on this situation.\\'\\' Fitzwater also predicted more such stories, although he did not say why. ``Suffice it to say, we find them (the news reports) mostly detrimental,\\'\\' he said. ``What they do is build up people\\'s expectations when they are not warranted.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.322289821428602  \\n   The United States and Iran have signed a $105 million settlement of some 3,000 financial claims, bringing the two countries one step closer to re-establishing economic relations, a U.S. official said today. The settlement deals primarily with so-called ``Small Claims\\'\\' for under $250,000 that stem from the 1979 Islamic revolution, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. It clears the way for the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal to deal with about $16 billion in major claims, whose resolution in turn could open the way to normalizing economic ties between the two nations, the official said. The settlement accord was signed late Sunday night or early this morning by Timothy Ramish, U.S. agent to the tribunal, and Iranian Agent Ali Nobari, according to the American official at the tribunal. The most recent settlement &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; between U.S. and Iranian officials occurred shortly after the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of American &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; Frank Reed and Robert Polhill by pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon. But U.S. and Iranian representatives to the tribunal have repeatedly stated the &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; dealt only with financial arbitration and not with the six remaining Americans still in captivity in Lebanon. Last week a U.S. State Department official in Washington, who commented on condition of anonymity, said he could not predict whether resolving its financial disputes will result in the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of remaining &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; or was in any way related to the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of Polhill and Reed. The Small Claims package dealt primarily with Americans who left behind personal possessions or were owed salaries by Iranian companies when they fled Iran during the revolution. They were settled for a total of $50 million. The settlement also provided $55 million for repayment of a loan from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The tribunal was set up as part of the Algiers Accord of 1980, which resulted in freedom for the American &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; by Iranian militants at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The tribunal has three Iranian, three American and three third-nation arbitrators. The biggest claim still before the tribunal, valued at up to $11 billion by Iran, is for military equipment which Iran ordered but did not receive as a result of the embargo imposed by the U.S. government. After the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979, Iran canceled contracts for $9 billion worth of weaponry, including four destroyers under construction that were later taken over by the U.S. Navy. Remaining major claims, totaling about $5 billion, were filed by American oil companies for property and operations expropiated by the Iranian government, as well as for broken contracts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  investigation keating regulators case lincoln deconcini office loan savings thrift meeting senators frank ethics annunzio federal april contractors cuomo staff &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.537365733743194  \\n   Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini wrote an aide in 1986 asking what ``we can do to bring heat\\'\\' on a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; banking regulator who was opposed by &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; owner Charles H. Keating Jr., the Senate Ethics Committee was told today. The senator\\'s memo to his &lt;b&gt; staff &lt;/b&gt; aide, Laurie A. Sedlmayr, was written in December 1986, after Keating had made clear his opposition to top bank regulator Edwin Gray, who wanted Keating\\'s &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; to adhere to investment limits. Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett cited the memo in questioning Sedlmayr as the panel held its fifth day of hearings into allegations DeConcini and four other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; improperly intervened with &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on behalf of Keating, a financial contributor. Sedlmayr said she was aware Keating wanted Gray out of office. DeConcini wrote her a memo on Dec. 11, 1986, citing press accounts of potential financial and ethical problems facing Gray and asking, ``Anything we can do to bring heat?\\'\\' She said she responded five days later saying it was ``probably unnecessary\\'\\' for him to take action and suggesting the senator ``stay out of this.\\'\\' Sedlmayr, under questioning by Bennett, said Keating was more aggressive than many other businessmen she dealt with. ``I found him to be something of a zealot and I wasn\\'t comfortable with that,\\'\\' she said. ``I think the senator probably thought I was overstating the case,\\'\\' she said. Keating, who owned the now defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan, and his associates contributed $1.3 million to the senators\\' campaigns or favored causes. As the panel began its fifth day of hearings in three weeks, DeConcini, D-Ariz., was the only one of the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; under &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; who attended the session. The other four are Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Donald Riegle of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio. Sedlmayr was questioned about a memo she wrote to DeConcini in 1987 suggesting a possible deal with the government on behalf of Keating\\'s &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and loan. DeConcini denies he offered a deal or tried to negotiate for Keating in the April 2, 1987, meeting. Sedlmayr testified that DeConcini went to the April 2 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with three other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; and Gray despite being warned by an aide that the session was a ``political mistake.\\'\\' She testified that she was not concerned about the propriety of the meeting, but was concerned Gray ``would misrepresent it\\'\\' later. ``I told him I didn\\'t think it was a good idea and could later be misinterpreted by the press,\\'\\' she said. ``I thought ... it was a political mistake.\\'\\' Sedlmayr and other aides were not included in the meeting, but she said that when it ended, DeConcini ``said he was pretty disgusted.\\'\\' She said DeConcini recounted that Gray had said, ``I don\\'t know anything about Lincoln, I don\\'t have any information and you\\'ll have to meet with the &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; in San Francisco.\\'\\' Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, did not attend that meeting. However, he did attend a session on Lincoln a week later with the other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; and San Francisco-based &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulators. The question of whether DeConcini offered a deal on Keating\\'s behalf is considered crucial to the &lt;b&gt; ethics &lt;/b&gt; investigation. Bennett, told the panel ``there is overwhelming evidence\\'\\' DeConcini asked Gray to withdraw a regulation opposed by Keating in exchange for a promise by Lincoln to make more home loans. The regulation limited Lincoln\\'s ability to make risky investments in speculative real estate ventures. Sedlmayr\\'s memo to her boss detailed ``What American Continental wants from Gray for concessions,\\'\\' and ``What American Continental is willing to do.\\'\\' American Continental was Lincoln\\'s Phoenix-based parent company, controlled by Keating. A sworn statement by another Senate aide says that DeConcini took the Sedlmayr memo with him to the April 2 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; and ``made verbal references to the subjects discussed in the memorandum.\\'\\' That statement was by Mary Jane Veno, administrative assistant to Glenn. She said she was told of the memo\\'s use by Gene Karp, DeConcini\\'s administrative assistant. When the &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; was over, she said, McCain asked DeConcini to explain what he had been talking about and in response DeConcini gave McCain a copy of the memo. But Karp said Friday he did not know if DeConcini actually referred to the memo and could not recall what he told Veno. ``As I remember it now, Gray said at the very beginning he didn\\'t know anything about Lincoln and DeConcini never got into the subject matter of the &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; or anything about that,\\'\\' Karp said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Whether there was any specific reference made, I can\\'t answer. Only the principals that were there can answer it.\\'\\' Gray has said DeConcini offered a ``quid pro quo\\'\\' proposal and that Gray believed the &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; was improper. No aides attended the April 2 meeting, and Bennett said there is evidence DeConcini\\'s &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; instructed all to come alone. Lincoln was the object of a bank board examination at the time of the meeting. Bennett said the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; were there ``with varying degrees of intensity, to pressure the board to end promptly the Lincoln examination.\\'\\' Lincoln was seized by the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; government in April 1989 at a potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion to cover insured deposits. &lt;/p&gt; 0.526604334871864  \\n   A U.S. &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; regulator testified Friday that Sen. Dennis DeConcini broke the bounds of propriety - but four other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; did not - when they intervened on behalf of &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; owner Charles H. Keating Jr. Regulator Michael Patriarca, addressing the Senate Ethics Committee, drew the line between the behavior of DeConcini, D-Ariz. and four colleagues: John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif. Patriarca said it was wrong for a senator to attempt to ``influence, to change the outcome\\'\\' of an examination that was highly critical of Keating\\'s Lincoln Savings and Loan. ``My personal view is Senator DeConcini did that,\\'\\' he said. ``It\\'s not clear to me that any of the others did.\\'\\' The regulator was referring to the senators\\' conduct at an April 9, 1987 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with four San Francisco-based &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; - including Patriarca - who were responsible for the Lincoln investigation. Patriarca also said he would fault the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; generally, because they ``appeared to have made up their minds in advance\\'\\' that Keating was right and the &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; were wrong in finding serious problems at Lincoln. Patriarca\\'s two days of testimony backed the assertion of his ex-boss, former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray, that DeConcini took the lead in trying to negotiate a deal on Keating\\'s behalf. DeConcini denied that he sought a waiver for Lincoln of a rule prohibiting risky investments, in return for the &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; establishing a home mortgage &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; program. Patriarca was questioned by Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., one of six Ethics Committee members who will judge whether the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; improperly intervened for Keating. Keating and associates donated $1.3 million to the campaigns and political causes of the five senators. The committee has held nine days of hearings in an effort to determine whether the money influenced the intervention. The hearing adjourned until Monday after a former member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board testified he received calls from Cranston and DeConcini in April 1989 - immediately before the government takeover of Lincoln. In those calls, said Roger Martin, both &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; urged the board to approve a sale of Lincoln rather than its seizure. The requests were rejected. All the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; except Riegle met on Keating\\'s behalf with Gray on April 2, 1987 in DeConcini\\'s office. When the chief regulator said he lacked details of the Lincoln investigation, the four San Francisco-based &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; including Patriarca, were summoned to the April 9 meeting. That also was in DeConcini\\'s &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and this time Riegle joined the group. Rudman asked Patriarca whether he thought DeConcini was ``out of line\\'\\' in the April 9 meeting, when he sought the waiver for Lincoln. ``Yes I did, senator,\\'\\' the regulator responded. He said that the proper way to challenge the regulation was through the courts and Lincoln ``had a retainer with every significant law firm in the country\\'\\' to do so. Lincoln in fact did, shortly before the meetings with regulators, file a court suit challenging the rule. The suit was not successful. Patriarca said McCain showed the ``least prejudice\\'\\' toward &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; at the April 9 meeting; DeConcini and ``perhaps Sen. Glenn seemed to have their minds made up pretty substantially\\'\\' and Riegle was ``in the middle.\\'\\' Another member of the committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., asked if the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; were hostile at the meeting. ``I think it was hostile,\\'\\' Patriarca said. ``We were being dressed down.\\'\\' Helms then asked whether the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; expressed ``surprise or shock\\'\\' after the &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; informed them that serious problems - and possible criminality - were found at Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif. ``We didn\\'t seem to be getting through to the senators,\\'\\' the regulator said. ``They did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that we were trying to convey to them.\\'\\' On Thursday, Patriarca said the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; became less aggressive when &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; said they would make criminal referrals to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt; 0.430818882237569  \\n   The Senate Ethics Committee today opened politically-charged hearings into links between five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; and the owner of a failed &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; and the panel\\'s chairman bluntly told the lawmakers that many people believe ``you sold your office.\\'\\' Four of the so-called Keating Five looked on as Sen. Howell Heflin said, ``many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services were bought by Charles Keating, that you were bribed, that you sold your office, that you traded your honor and your good names for contributions and other benefits.\\'\\' Sens. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona each listened intently as Heflin spoke in his gravely Southern accent. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment, did not attend. All five deny any wrongdoing. Committee counsel Robert Bennett jostled a boxed puzzle before the committee members as he began his opening statement, saying he would provide them with a picture that later pieces of evidence would fill in. Bennett said Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle ``were important players\\'\\' in helping Keating in his ``all-out war\\'\\' with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulators. He said McCain and Glenn played lesser roles. Bennett said he did not contend it was improper for the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; to hold meetings with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulators, but that it was up to the panel to decide whether their actions were improper. He said ``there can be no doubt\\'\\' that the intent of each of the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; was to help Keating when they met with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; in 1987. The five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; received a total of $1.3 million in campaign contributions or donations to their favored causes from Keating and his associates. All contacted &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on behalf of Keating at a time when the government was considering whether to seize the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine, Calif.-based &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; institution. The &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; later collapsed at an estimated cost to the taxpayers of $2 billion. Heflin told the five they would have the chance to say whether the donations ``influenced your actions in any way.\\'\\' He said lawmakers\\' activities legitimately include helping their constituents and overseeing government institutions and added that there is room for disagreement about conclusions in the case. Bennett said the evidence will be clear despite the refusal of Keating to answer questions during the Senate inquiry. Keating has been indicted in California on state securities fraud charges and is awaiting trial. ``One could ask the question, `If Mr. Keating were here, would you believe what he had to say anyway?\\'\\'\\' Bennett said. The five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; have become a symbol of the massive &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; industry collapse, and the outcome of the &lt;b&gt; ethics &lt;/b&gt; hearings could intensify the political ramifications of what so far has been a bipartisan scandal. In addition, the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; has highlighted a political system that gives lawmakers great latitude in contacting &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on behalf of constituents, at the same time they are dependent on campaign contributions to mount their political campaigns. The hearings stemmed from a complaint last year by the citizens group Common Cause. ``It\\'s not just the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; but the whole Senate whose integrity and credibility is on the line,\\'\\' said Fred Werthheimer, the organization\\'s leader. Heflin and others on the panel said the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; should not create a standard that bars members of Congress from intervening with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; agencies on behalf of constituents or campaign contributors. ``A standard of conduct which would preclude members of Congress from intervening on behalf of individuals who happened to have contributed to or raised funds for their campaign is nonsensical and unworkable under existing law,\\'\\' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., another member of the committee, complained that panel has taken too long with the case. ``We should have already taken certain ... actions,\\'\\' he said. Heflin, D-Ala., defended the panel\\'s decision to hold the hearings against charges of partisanship. ``On all the votes taken by the committee ... not one was divided along partisan lines,\\'\\' he said. With documents stacked several inches high on a table covered with green felt, Heflin framed the issue that the &lt;b&gt; ethics &lt;/b&gt; panel will have to grapple with: ``The allegation in this case, that an individual used his wealth to get preferential treatment from government officials in the performance of their official duties, raises questions which are as old as history, and issues that bear on the balance of power among the branches of the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; government. The committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or recommend a more serious punishment to the full Senate. Each senator has denied any connection between Keating\\'s money and their meetings with regulators. The basic issue is whether any violated Senate rules against exerting improper influence in return for compensation. All except Riegle attended an April 2, 1987, &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with Ed Gray, then the top &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; regulator. All five attended another &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; a week later with San Francisco-based bank examiners who revealed that potential criminal actions by Lincoln were involved. McCain\\'s top aide, Chris Koch, said McCain would make the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; that he ended his friendship with Keating on March 24, 1987, when Keating asked the senator to negotiate with &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on his behalf. ``There\\'s no smoking gun on Don Riegle,\\'\\' the Michigan senator\\'s lawyer, Thomas Green, said before the hearing. He contended that Riegle\\'s &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; was unrelated to a fund-raising effort Keating directed for Riegle. DeConcini wrote a letter to about 5,000 supporters this week denying wrongdoing. ``You may hear derogatory statements about me and my office, but I can assure you that I have not betrayed my public trust, nor do I intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their dealings with our government,\\'\\' DeConcini said. Glenn has said in the past that he had no discussions on behalf of Lincoln after the 1987 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; when &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; said criminal charges were possible. Cranston\\'s spokesman, Murray Flander, said Cranston contends, ``I pocketed no money, I broke no law, I violated no Senate rule. Those are undisputed facts.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.352777354026735  \\n   Gov. Mario Cuomo today accused lawyers for a black teen-ager who says she was assaulted by six white men of ``making up conditions\\'\\' as part of their continuing refusal to have the young woman testify about the case. Meanwhile, the teen-ager\\'s aunt was quoted today as saying the girl hadn\\'t even talked about the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; with the lawyers representing her. Tawana Brawley, 16, missing for four days in November, was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces, with racial insults scrawled on her body. She said she was assaulted by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge. Miss Brawley, of Wappinger\\'s Falls north of New York City, and her family have refused to be questioned further on the advice of attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. of New York City, the lawyers who used a similar tactic to get a special prosecutor appointed in the Howard Beach manslaughter case. Cuomo had nothing good to say about those lawyers at an impromptu news conference today. ``They said they had reasons they could not cooperate. ... It\\'s clear now they don\\'t really,\\'\\' Cuomo said of the two lawyers. ``These conditions obviously don\\'t mean anything. They keep making up new conditions.\\'\\' Maddox and Mason were on the road this morning and not immediately available for comment on Cuomo\\'s statements or today\\'s report in the Middletown Times Herald Record newspaper that Miss Brawley hadn\\'t talked to the lawyers about the case. Cuomo said again today that he was willing to meet with Miss Brawley if it would help push the stalled &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; along. However, he said he would do so only if her lawyers approved and state Attorney General Robert Abrams, Cuomo\\'s special prosecutor in the case, said it would be helpful. In her interview with the Middletown newspaper, Juanita Brawley, who helped raise Tawana for eight years and who has spent time with her since her attack, said she is the only one who knows enough about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girl\\'s mother informed. ``I know a few things that no one else knows,\\'\\' she said in an interview at her home. She said of Maddox: ``He has not talked to Tawana. He does not need to talk to Tawana.\\'\\' She did not elaborate. On Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said the Brawley family would go to jail before testifying before a grand jury empaneled by Abrams. Sharpton, a minister from New York City who has said he is advising the family, said Cuomo is using ``macho politics\\'\\' in trying to compel Tawana\\'s testimony. On Wednesday, Cuomo had called on Abrams to ask a grand jury when it convenes Monday in Poughkeepsie to force Miss Brawley and her family to cooperate with investigators. ``Someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a young girl who has already been abused,\\'\\' Sharpton said of Cuomo. This morning, Cuomo said that whatever happened with the grand jury, he thought it was ``very unlikely\\'\\' that Tawana would be sent to jail even if she continued her refusal to cooperate with Abrams\\' investigation. On Thursday, Cuomo had told New York City radio station WLIB that he can\\'t understand why the Brawley family will not cooperate with authorities. ``I see no reason, no common-sense reason, no difficult-to-understand reason, why there is not cooperation,\\'\\' Cuomo said. ``At one point you have to ask yourself, why aren\\'t they cooperating with the prosecutors?\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.350349098513716  \\n   Highflying former &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; owner Donald Ray Dixon goes on trial Wednesday on charges he used depositors\\' money to finance lavish acquisitions, leaving taxpayers with a $1.3 billion &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; bailout. Dixon, 50, traveled the world for gourmet parties and acquired such trinkets as a 17th Century castle door, Baccarat crystal, Remington sculptures, a silver-studded saddle and a posh house in Solana Beach, Calif., just north of San Diego. The government says those luxuries, as well as payments to prostitutes and political campaigns, were financed from the vaults at Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association, which collapsed under the weight of Dixon\\'s excess in 1987 and was taken over by the government. A dozen other Vernon executives and associates have preceded Dixon in court; 10 have been convicted and a guilty verdict against two others was set aside because the jury discussed Dixon\\'s indictment. ``Perhaps when my day in court comes, if they\\'ll listen, they\\'ll find out what really happened and the blame can be properly assessed and properly assigned,\\'\\' Dixon said in July when he was arraigned on a 38-count indictment. The indictment charged him with conspiracy, misapplication of funds, making false statements and other crimes. Jury selection was to begin Wednesday in &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; court. Testimony is expected to begin Monday, and continue three to four weeks. If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be sentenced to up to 190 years in prison and fined as much as $9.5 million. An extra-large panel of 75 to 80 potential jurors was called because of publicity in the case, said Jean Hiller, court coordinator for U.S. District Judge Joe A. Fish. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jarvis of Dallas said 40 to 50 prosecution witnesses could testify. Included on that list is a convicted madam, who has confirmed that she supplied prostitutes for Vernon executives when they were in San Diego. Defense and prosecution attorneys declined to discuss the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; this week, citing a instructions from Fish. Until the recent notoriety given Neal Bush and Silverado Savings and Loan in Colorado or Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loan in California, Dixon and Vernon were at or near the top of the list of abuses cited in the industry. Dixon\\'s trial is an effort ``to bring to justice people who break the law, who use &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; associations as personal piggy banks, and who may have thought they could just walk away free and let the American taxpayer shoulder the cost of their greed,\\'\\' said Timothy Ryan, Office of Thrift Supervision director in Washington. Vernon had a luxury yacht and a fleet of five planes worth $6 million. The S&amp;L also paid the $22,000 tab for Dixon\\'s gastronomic tour of European restaurants, the government said. Dixon also is charged with illegal contributions to such politicians as former House Speaker Jim Wright and Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York who is now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Recipients of those funds did not know they came from illegal sources, prosecutors have said. When &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; closed Vernon, it was the largest &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; bailout in history, and it remains among the most expensive. Most of the expensive acquisitions have been sold at auction since the government takeover. When &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; closed Vernon, they renamed it Monfort Savings Association. In December 1988, Monfort was one of five insolvent thrifts combined to create First Gibraltar Bank, the largest &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; in Texas. Vernon also has resulted in the stiffest sentence to date for an S&amp;L officer. Former Chairman Woody F. Lemons was sentenced to 30 years in prison earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  government party political opposition minister power leader elections country communist democratic national leaders parties movement groups council prime parliament constitution &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.477649757052216  \\n   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, head of Sweden\\'s caretaker Cabinet, is ready to lead a new &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; to replace the one which resigned last week, the &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; news agency TT reported Thursday. Earlier Thursday, the Social Democratic &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; informed Parliament Speaker Thage G. Peterson he was ready and able to present the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; to the legislature for approval. He was expected to get active support from the small Communist Party and passive support for the comeback by the middle-of-the-road Center Party. His previous &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; resigned on Feb. 15 when the Communists joined other &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; to defeat a bill for a two-year wage and price freeze. &lt;/p&gt; 0.473102375922439  \\n   The resignation of Bulgaria\\'s Socialist premier calmed raging anti-Communist sentiment, but it hasn\\'t done anything to solve the country\\'s deep economic and &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; crisis. Unrelenting pressure from the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; in Parliament and from strikes and street demonstrations forced Premier Andrei Lukanov and his &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; of former Communists to leave office on Thursday. Tens of thousands of people cheered in the streets of Sofia, an &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; stronghold. But Lukanov\\'s demise may prove a Pyrrhic victory. The main &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, the Union of Democratic Forces, must now prove it can help solve Bulgaria\\'s social and economic woes. ``Not even Jesus can fill Bulgarian stores,\\'\\' Lukanov said in a recent speech. A new coalition &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; probably will be announced next week. So far, nothing has been revealed about who will head it, whether it will be a collection of nonpolitical experts or draw in equal numbers on &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; and the still-powerful Socialists. The Union of Democratic Forces &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; had long criticized Lukanov for mismanagement, demanding that he step down. But it is questionable whether anybody could manage Bulgaria\\'s economy, which is so dependent on the collapsing Soviet bloc that it can only reflect the chaos of that disintegrating alliance. The &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; case against Lukanov always seemed to rest more on a desire to get the former Communists out of office. The opposition, and many of its Western supporters, seemed convinced it would win June elections. When the Socialists won, the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; formally accepted the result, but has seemed unable to live with it since. Street demonstrations got under way almost immediately, with students around the &lt;b&gt; country &lt;/b&gt; occupying universities to force the resignation of Socialist President Petar Mladenov. Mladenov bowed to the pressure in early July. Then it took three weeks of Byzantine &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; wrangling to get Zhelyu Zhelev, formerly the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; leader, appointed president. Lukanov, seen by observers as one of the few capable politicians in Bulgaria, was widely credited with persuading the Socialists to accept Zhelev. But the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; never came through with the tacitly implied second part of the deal: agreement to join the former Communists in Lukanov\\'s government. Backed by some Western diplomats, the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; apparently felt the Socialists were a spent &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; force bound to disintegrate. For his part, Lukanov refused to break with the Socialist Party, arguing that it stood for his social &lt;b&gt; democratic &lt;/b&gt; ideals. Lukanov eventually appointed an all-Socialist &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; but continued to battle for broad support, arguing this was vital to a vague but sweeping program of economic reform. Meanwhile, the economy and society slid into chaos. Electricity and food rationing began in Sofia and other cities in September. Stores have grown barer since. Power is now shut off two hours in every four in the capital. The worst outburst of violence came in late August, when an angry crowd invaded Socialist Party headquarters, burning and pillaging several offices. Last week, the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; took the decisive step of walking out of Parliament. A general strike by the main &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; union this week proved the final blow to the Socialist government. Although the &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; are said to have agreed on a transition &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; until new &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; are held in May, there is virtually no evidence of &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; unity. The Socialist Party draws on 100 years of tradition and is even older than the Soviet Communist movement, but remains severely split. The unwieldy &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; coalition of 16 &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; also is deeply divided, and boasts few figures of Lukanov\\'s caliber. On Friday, Sofia returned to its bitter reality. The shoppers glumly queuing for food know the new &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; is unlikely to make life much better. ``Even though I am stepping down, my economic and social program has no alternative,\\'\\' Lukanov told the Grand National Assembly in his farewell speech Friday. In his last weeks before resigning, Lukanov pushed for radical market-oriented reforms including an austerity budget that would jack up many state-controlled prices, close down unprofitable firms and introduce guarantees for foreign investments. If Bulgaria does not carry out radical reforms soon, it could find itself lagging far behind ``the European train\\'\\' of change, Lukanov told reporters. ``I\\'m afraid we have already missed the train,\\'\\' he added. --- EDITORS: Veselin Toshkov, AP correspondent in Sofia, has worked in posts in Bulgaria and abroad for 15 years. &lt;/p&gt; 0.431498096259634  \\n   Opposition &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; and Communist officials have tentatively set &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; for June, &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; television reported. ``According to unofficial information, the first round of (parliamentary) &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; should take place on June 8,\\'\\' Czechoslovak TV said Thursday. The report came as the Communists, other &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; Civic Forum met to review procedures for the &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; and the status of independent &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; parties. ``The draft &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; law is aimed at having the &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; for the Federal Assembly and both National Councils (parliament) first ... and in the second half of the year the &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; to the lower levels of representative bodies should take place,\\'\\' the television said. The 35O-member Czechoslovak Parliament is so far dominated by Communists. The discussions are expected to produce a solution to balancing its membership to reflect the current &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; situation. The talks are being attended by all five &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; existing before the revolution and the loosely organized &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, Civic Forum. About 20 new &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; have been created in Czechoslovakia the past two months, but none is represented at the current talks. The peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia led to the ouster of Communist &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; chief Milos Jakes and his hard-line colleagues in late November. Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel became president last month. &lt;/p&gt; 0.398983304235509  \\n   Efforts to reshape South Korea\\'s faction-ridden politics took a new turn today when President Roh Tae-woo\\'s governing &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; indicated it would dissolve itself to form a new ``grand\\'\\' conservative party. The move by the governing Democratic Justice Party, coupled with strenuous efforts by the two centrist &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; to merge, made the country\\'s &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; picture complex. ``We will actively respond to moves by the two &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; to merge,\\'\\' said the governing party\\'s secretary general, Park Jun-byung. Another Democratic Justice official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``It is possible that we would consider forming a new pan-national, centrist &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; representing all &lt;b&gt; democratic &lt;/b&gt; groups.\\'\\' If the new conservative &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; is formed, the governing &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; could be folded and its leader, Roh, would give up &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; membership and stay neutral, the same official said. Kim Young-sam, head of the No. 2 &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, said today that he would firm up plans next month to merge his Reunification Democratic Party with the No. 3 &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, the New Democratic Republican Party, led by former premier Kim Jong-pil. The two &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; earlier agreed in principle to merge their &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; possibly before local elections, scheduled in the first half of this year. ``It would not be a simple merger of two parties. The new &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; to be born would be a central force comprising all conservative groups,\\'\\' Kim Young-sam told reporters. Kim said his ultimate goal is to make the present four-party system into a bipartisan setup. If the two &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; merge, it would become the largest &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, replacing Kim Dae-jung\\'s Party for Peace and Democracy. The emergence of a centrist &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; would be welcome news for the governing party, which has been trying to isolate and discredit Kim Dae-jung\\'s liberal, pro-reform party. Kim Dae-jung, holding a news conference today, vehemently opposed the planned merger by his &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; rivals, contending an artificial restructuring of the present four-party system would only benefit Roh\\'s governing party. He said the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; camp would try to use the planned &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; merger to seek a conservative alliance, through which it would try to remain in &lt;b&gt; power &lt;/b&gt; beyond 1993, when Roh steps down at the end of a single five-year term. Many politicians believe the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; camp also favors a &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; realignment that would enable it to hold onto &lt;b&gt; power &lt;/b&gt; as Japan\\'s governing Liberal Democratic Party does. If its plan to merge or seek alliance with &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; moderates is successful, the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; camp, assured of enough votes in the Assembly, would propose a constitutional amendemnt to change the present presidential system into a Cabinet setup headed by a &lt;b&gt; prime &lt;/b&gt; minister, they said. The governing party, with 127 seats in the Assembly, is currently far short of a two-third majority required for a constitutional amendment. South Korea\\'s politics are currently controlled by four main parties, neither of which has a controling majority in the 299-member National Assembly. The three main &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; have a combined majority in the single house but intense rivalry makes it difficult for them to cooperate. At his news conference, Kim Dae-jung said he would try to rally support from ``centrist &lt;b&gt; democratic &lt;/b&gt; forces\\'\\' to counter moves by his rivals to merge or seek alliance. However, his proposal lacked details. He also reiterated that his &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; would, if the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; endorses the plan, send delegates to &lt;b&gt; communist &lt;/b&gt; North Korea in the first half of this year to discuss &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; unification. If the dispatch of the &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; delegation is proven successful, Kim said he would visit Pyongyang with &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; approval to meet with North Korean &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; Kim Il Sung He said President Roh responded favorably when he raised the issue last week. But presidential and &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; officials said the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; plan to send delegates to the north was premature. &lt;/p&gt; 0.395253676640631  \\n   Neil Kinnock, &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; of Britain\\'s &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; Labor Party, will be challenged for the post by veteran leftist Tony Benn at the &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; conference in the fall, a Labor coalition said Wednesday. The Campaign Group, composed of about 40 leftist &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; lawmakers, said Kinnock\\'s deputy, moderate Roy Hattersley, will be challenged by leftist Eric Heffer. The announcement came after a meeting of the party\\'s &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; executive committee. Kinnock, 46, and Hattersley are considered not as left wing as Benn and Heffer. Benn, 62, a former Cabinet minister, has accused Kinnock of watering down socialism after the party\\'s three defeats in nine years by the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Kinnock and Hattersley have worked for a united &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; and cracked down on militants in hopes of making a broader appeal to voters. They say a leadership contest will distract the &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; from opposing the government. Kinnock and Hattersley denounced the challenge in a joint statement as ``futile and selfish\\'\\' and predicted ``massive defeat\\'\\' for Benn and Heffer. Benn told reporters: ``Democracy is about choice.\\'\\' Heffer said: ``The time has come for a crusade for socialism. The working people of this &lt;b&gt; country &lt;/b&gt; are getting a worse and worse deal.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  women men population training education program discrimination young programs minority language bureau society rights male included hispanic association female groups &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.402719350256743  \\n   The University of California at Berkeley, recently disrupted by student protests demanding more &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; teachers, has launched a new cultural studies program. Beginning with the freshman class of 1991, all undergraduates will be required to take one course on &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; culture. Each of the courses will focus on three &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; ethnic groups, said Ron Choy, assistant director of the new program. ``We\\'re creating a whole new &lt;b&gt; program &lt;/b&gt; from scratch,\\'\\' said Choy, assistant director of the new Center for the Teaching and Study of American Cultures. The center, planned for some time, opened Thursday. Choy said he expects students to welcome the courses, noting the ethnically diverse student body has a strong interest in race and &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; reations. Some students boycotted classes for two days last month to protest the lack of ethnic diversity among the faculty. Out of 1,636 full professors, only 24 percent are &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; or members of &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; groups. ``Frankly, this center was created partly to help get the faculty up to date,\\'\\' Choy said. ``We have to teach them, too.\\'\\' The 1989-90 student body is 45 percent white, 27 percent Asian, 13 percent Hispanic, 8 percent black, 1 percent American Indian and 6 percent undeclared, according to the school. The cultural studies center was created as part of a restructuring of Berkeley\\'s 1960s-era ethnic studies programs, Choy said. ``Most ethnics studies classes just talk about one group,\\'\\' he said. ``We want to create new classes that will deal with at least three &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; groups &lt;/b&gt; at one time in an integrated, comparative way.\\'\\' Such an overlapping picture of ethnic &lt;b&gt; groups &lt;/b&gt; will better mirror society, he said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.333286187168428  \\n   A federal judge apologized Thursday to an attorney he had scolded and threatened with jail when she insisted on using her maiden name and the courtesy title ``Ms.\\'\\' in court. ``I have always referred to married &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; by their married name. This is the way my generation was taught,\\'\\' said Senior U.S. District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum, 73. ``I recognize your right to be addressed in any manner in which you see fit, and I apologize for my comments and the resulting situation,\\'\\' the judge told Barbara Wolvovitz and three other attorneys involved in the trial of a race &lt;b&gt; discrimination &lt;/b&gt; suit against PPG Industries Inc. On July 8, Teitelbaum told Ms. Wolvovitz, whose husband is University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel: ``From here on, in this courtroom you will use Mrs. Lobel. That\\'s your name.\\'\\' The judge originally threatened her with jail when she resisted his instruction, and when her co-counsel, Jon Pushinsky, protested, Teitelbaum found him in contempt for ``officious intermeddling\\'\\' and gave him a suspended 30-day jail sentence. Ms. Wolvovitz, representing two black &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; suing PPG, moved Monday for a mistrial, which Teitelbaum rejected. When she again stated her preference, he said: ``What if I call you sweetie?\\'\\' The judge said he would settle for calling her ``counselor.\\'\\' He also vacated his contempt order for Pushinsky. The jury began deliberations Wednesday afternoon and was still out when the judge made his apology, which was officially entered into court records. Teitelbaum said that if Ms. Wolvovitz still wanted to press for a mistrial, he would grant it before the jury returned with a verdict. Teitelbaum said the parties would be ``stuck with that verdict\\'\\' if they declined his offer. The attorneys agreed to not seek a mistrial. Hours later, the jury decided against Ms. Wolvovitz\\'s clients, who had charged they were harassed at work because of their race. Ms. Wolvovitz, 36, who has practiced law for 10 years, and Pushinsky did not want to comment further after the judge\\'s apology, Pushinsky said Thursday. ``I think that he did what he had to do, and thank God he did it,\\'\\' said National Organization for Women President Molly Yard, a Pittsburgh resident who is familiar with Teitelbaum. ``I think it\\'s raised everybody\\'s consciousness and that\\'s fine.\\'\\' Tom Hollander, president of the Allegheny County Bar Association, said: ``I think it was big of him to apologize.\\'\\' JoAnn Dempler, Teitelbaum\\'s law clerk for eight years, said the judge ``is not sexist ... does not discriminate against woman ... does not demean women.\\'\\' ``He\\'s a tease,\\'\\' she said Thursday. ``His sense of humor is such that he likes to tease and joke and kid around, and if people do not know that, they could easily misconstrue what he\\'s doing or saying. ``Even in court, because we\\'re dealing with very serious matters, every once in a while to just sort of inject a little levity or reduce tension he will make a lighthearted remark, and people who know him realize he doesn\\'t mean to offend anyone,\\'\\' Mrs. Dempler said. Teitelbaum said he wasn\\'t teasing when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she would ``sleep in the county jail tonight\\'\\' if she refused to be addressed as Mrs. Lobel. ``I unfortunately lost my temper and the matter then got out of hand,\\'\\' he said. The judge also said he misstated Pennsylvania law when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she was legally required to use her husband\\'s last name unless she had court permission to do otherwise. ``I was wrong,\\'\\' Teitelbaum said. ``I made a mistake.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.332884933072444  \\n   In South Africa, feminism is viewed with suspicion as a foreign philosophy, even among many women. With racial &lt;b&gt; discrimination &lt;/b&gt; the overriding social issue, sexist practices go unchecked in both white and black communities. There are few protests, for a variety of reasons. &lt;/p&gt; 0.321604845236526  \\n   This has been ``a decade of progress for &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; on television\\'\\' _ especially for &lt;b&gt; female &lt;/b&gt; characters in prime time _ but the industry must be monitored to ensure further gains, the National Commission on Working Women said. The accolade and note of caution came Tuesday as the commission released a report entitled ``Ten Years in Prime Time: An Analysis of the Image of Women on Entertainment Television, 1979-1988,\\'\\' which examined the portrayal of &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; and compared the fictional panorama with the profile of real-life &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; during the decade. ``The 1980s mark a decade of progress for &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; on television. Their portrayals have become more diverse and, for the most part, more true-to-life,\\'\\' the report said. ``... The networks get a pat on the back,\\'\\' said the study\\'s author, Sally Streenland. The study said 60 percent of &lt;b&gt; female &lt;/b&gt; characters on the 25 top Nielsen rated shows in 1979 were portrayed as employed outside the home. By 1987, that figure had risen to 75 percent. By comparison, 1987 &lt;b&gt; population &lt;/b&gt; statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau show that 56 percent of all &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; were in the labor force. Streenland\\'s study also showed TV painting an unrealistically rosy picture of the types of jobs held by women. In 1979, more than 40 percent of television\\'s &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; were employed in clerical or service jobs. By 1987 only 23 percent of the &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; on TV had the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional careers. The real life situation is that 47 percent of working &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; have clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent work in professional or managerial jobs. The report also showed that black &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; have become more visible on TV. In 1979 there was only one black &lt;b&gt; female &lt;/b&gt; character on television, but by 1987, 22 percent of &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; characters were black. &lt;/p&gt; 0.312385004656423  \\n   Authorities are extending mandatory birth control to the far northwest\\'s ethnic minorities, but they will be allowed more children than majority Hans, an official report said Sunday. As of July 1, &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; couples in cities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be limited to two children, and those in rural areas will be permitted three, the Xinhua News Agency said. Minority ethnic &lt;b&gt; groups &lt;/b&gt; in Xinjiang total 8.6 million, or more than 61 percent of the population, the report said. Most Hans or ethnic Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of China\\'s 1 billion people, are limited to one child with the country struggling to feed and educate its spiraling population. However, the policy has been more relaxed toward China\\'s 56 ethnic &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; groups. The different standard toward minorities has been designed in part to win their loyalty to the Han-controlled government and allay their fears of being overwhelmed by ethnic Chinese. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  magazine newspaper paper newspapers editor publisher press news publication article note publishing hotel published women reporter advertising media editorial journal &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.683699096281642  \\n   The following are the most popular videocassettes as they appear in next week\\'s issue of Billboard magazine.

Photographer David Mecey had planned to meet with Providence College students for part of a Big East athletic conference layout scheduled for the April 1989 issue, Playboy spokeswoman Cindy Rakowitz said from New York. Mecey, who planned to stay in Providence from Wednesday through Friday, intended to interview and photograph &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; in various locations, including the Providence Marriott Inn where he had a reservation. The planned feature would include nude and semi-nude photos. The hotel\\'s name and number were listed on a Playboy leaflet and in a quarter-page advertisement to appear in today\\'s edition of The NewPaper, said Anne Trumbore, an employee at the weekly alternative newspaper. But Stephen McCarthy, the hotel\\'s resident manager, said that when officials realized Wednesday morning who Mecey was, they decided not to allow him to conduct business at the hotel. Mecey was told by &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; officials when he arrived Wednesday night that he could not conduct interviews on &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; property. ``If he wants to stay here, he can. He has rented a room and we are in the business of renting rooms,\\'\\' said general manager Rene Neidhart. ``But he did not have our authorization to use our name in any advertisements, and he cannot interview or photograph in the hotel.\\'\\' ``I\\'m not entirely taken aback, but I think that\\'s pretty drastic,\\'\\' said Rakowitz when informed of the Marriott\\'s decision. ``That\\'s sort of eliminating the rights of the individual to make a freedom of choice _ but a &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; is private property.\\'\\' Playboy also was banned from interviewing or staying at the Sheraton Tara in Braintree, Mass., when it interviews Boston College students in mid-November, said Jeff Cohen, Playboy\\'s managing photo editor. Some people who arrived at the Marriott looking for Mecey were escorted off &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; property by security guards, said McCarthy. He said several people, both &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; and men, were removed from the lobby and floors. Playboy had decided against seeking the cooperation of administrators at any of the schools it will visit, deciding instead to advertise off-campus and in college newspapers. Playboy had hoped to run an ad in the Cowl, the student &lt;b&gt; newspaper &lt;/b&gt; at the 3,800-student college, but students and administrators decided against it, said a school spokesman, the Rev. John McGreevy. Officials at St. John\\'s University in New York, another Catholic school, decided earlier this month against running an &lt;b&gt; article &lt;/b&gt; about the Playboy feature in its student newspaper. ``I\\'m still confident that we will recruit our women,\\'\\' said Rakowitz, who said about 20 &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; were wanted for the feature. ``I\\'ve never come into a problem at a hotel. I think it\\'s sort of repressing.\\'\\' Other schools in the Big East Conference are Villanova University, in Villanova, Pa.; Washington\\'s Georgetown University; Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J.; the University of Connecticut; the University of Pittsburgh; and New York\\'s Syracuse University. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  india people indian state militants killed pakistan percent government kashmir sinhalese bc-spe--health miles moslem sikh tamil hindu million extremists united &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.564022268790565  \\n   Authorities moved to placate separatist Moslem &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; Monday by dissolving the legislative assembly of Jammu-Kashmir &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; and acknowledging that the 1987 polls in which it was elected might have been rigged. Also Monday, at least three &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and six injured in confrontations between security forces and Moslem protesters agitating for the secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-majority India. State Gov. Jagmohan said the Jammu-Kashmir assembly was being dissolved because it had ``lost its representative character.\\'\\' The move clears the way for new elections to the assembly, which could form the basis for making peace overtures to the militants. Many of the &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; say they were members of political parties earlier, and began agitating for an independent nation after what they claim was widespread rigging during the 1987 elections. ``It has been alleged that in 1987 some vested interests had rigged the election,\\'\\' Jagmohan said in a statement issued in Srinagar. In those elections, Farooq Abdullah was voted the chief minister, the top elected post in the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; administration, for a five-year term. Abdullah resigned from the post on Jan. 19 to protest the appointment of Jagmohan as governor of the state. Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, has said that quelling militant violence and holding new elections is the only way to defuse the separatist movement in the Moslem-majority state. Police reported at least three deaths Monday as Moslem crowds violated curfew orders in two towns in the valley. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and six injured when police opened fire to control a rioting mob in the town of Bijbehara, 30 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southeast of Srinagar. One person was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in the town of Shopian, 33 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; south of Srinagar, in another incident of police firing, they said. The deaths raise to at least 103 the number of &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since authorities launched a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20. Most of the victims have been protesters &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in police firing on curfew violators. The movement for secession of Kashmir from India is at least four decades old, but has flared in recent months. The &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; of Jammu-Kashmir, which includes the valley and the plains of Jammu to the south, is India\\'s only Moslem-majority state. India and Pakistan have both claimed Kashmir since the Indian subcontinent was divided along religious lines after gaining independence from Britain in 1947. The countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, and Pakistan occupies a slice of the valley. A U.N.-monitored cease-fire line divides the valley into Indian and Pakistani sectors. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the trouble in Kashmir. Islamabad denies the charge but says the Kashmri &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have a right to self-determination. About 64 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Jammu-Kashmir\\'s 6 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; population. Hindus make up 82 percent. &lt;/p&gt; 0.562268472012152  \\n   Three Sinhalese &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; and a soldier were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; torched buses on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence, police said today. Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in Colombo, the capital, and its surburbs. Police said &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were afraid to open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed to the Indian-brokered peace accord. A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the island\\'s south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike. Residents in the northern city of Vavuniya, about 125 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of Colombo, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also declared curfews in some areas in the island\\'s north and east until Sunday morning to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels. The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for five years for independence in the north and east of the island and by the Peoples Liberation Front, an extremist group from the island\\'s majority Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority, while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for independence. Three men were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by police in separate incidents in which Sinhalese &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; tried to attack &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; property, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said a Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; in Hambantota district in the south. In southern and central Sri Lanka, strongholds of the Sinhalese extremists, at least eight government-owned buses were set afire Thursday night and this morning, the police spokesman said. Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern Sri Lanka were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; bew up electrical transformers, he said. A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a firebomb as it pulled into Colombo, police said. Only a few government-owned or private buses were seen running. In the island\\'s north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called for a demonstration to protest the peace pact. On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by Tamil rebels near Padaviya village, about 100 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of Colombo. The peace accord, signed by India and Sri Lanka on July 29, 1987, calls for the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; to grant limited autonomy to minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight for a separate Tamil nation. India agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, refused to accept the accord. India is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its own Tamil minority of 60 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; for the island conflict. Before the peace pact was signed, Sri Lanka regularly accused India of training and supplying the rebels. More than 8,000 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have been &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since the ethnic war began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Sri Lanka\\'s 16 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; and control the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; and the army. More than 400 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have been &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since the accord was signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists. Most of the victims have been &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; officials or members of the governing United National Party of President Junius R. Jayewardene, who signed the accord. &lt;/p&gt; 0.551098179376065  \\n   Eight bombs exploded today in the stronghold of Moslem &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; seeking independence for the Himalayan valley of Kashmir, authorities said. No one was injured. Authorities said the blasts, at two banks, a post office and other shops and businesses, occurred hours after fire swept through a shopping complex in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. No one claimed responsibilty for the explosions. Police said they believe the blaze was an accident since it occurred before dawn while a curfew was still in force. But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed the fire and the bombs on the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, the militant group leading the four-decade-old drive for the country\\'s only Moslem majority &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; to secede from predominantly Hindu India. India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but says the Kashmiri &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have a right to self-determination. At least 82 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have been &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since Jan. 20 in frequent street clashes between &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; and security forces in Srinagar and adjoining areas. Most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying curfew imposed by &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; forces to stem rising violence. The curfew was relaxed during the day from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m., except in the areas where the explosions occurred. Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir. Sixty-four &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the state\\'s 5 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Moslems, but Moslems make up 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; population nationwide. Kashmiri &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population, but the &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; now demand independence and the status of a neutral country. India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir. &lt;/p&gt; 0.532038328268148  \\n   Police today detained about 10,000 Hindu students on their way to a protest rally in the Kashmir Valley, where a day earlier 21 Moslems were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in a reported shootout. The caravan of buses and trucks that was stopped in Udhampur, 45 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; north of Jammu, was headed toward Srinagar, where the Hindu activists of the All India Students\\' Federation had planned to hoist Indian flags. The government, fearing violence, had appealed to the Hindu activists not to hold their procession to Srinagar, a Moslem stronghold in Kashmir, the northern sector of Jammu-Kashmir state. The students, based in Jammu in a predominantly Hindu sector, had ignored the official pleas. The Hindu students are opposed to a Moslem secessionist movement that is attempting to get independence for Jammu-Kashmir state, the only Indian &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; in which the majority of the population is Moslem. The students were arrested without resistance, one official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. They were expected to be released after a few hours without charges being pressed. In Srinagar, shops were closed and traffic stayed off the roads today in response to a general strike call given by Moslem militants. The strike was to protest the deaths of 21 Kashmiris Tuesday during a shoot-out with paramiltary troops near Srinagar. The &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; claimed all the victims, including 17 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; in a bus which exploded and caught fire, were militants. A &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; statement said the bus exploded when a stray bullet hit a pile of ammunition inside it. At least 1,175 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have ben &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in Kashmir since January, when the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; started a crackdown on the secessionists. About 64 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Jammu-Kashmir\\'s 6 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Moslems. About 82 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of India\\'s 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Hindus while Moslems account for 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt; 0.521947258258326  \\n   A bomb hidden in a motor scooter exploded in a crowded vegetable market in Punjab &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; today, killing at least 31 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; and wounding 70 others as Hindus celebrated a religious holiday, police said. The bombing, which police blamed on Sikh separatists, raised to 39 the number &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since Monday in the northern state. Sikhs campaigning for a separate nation have &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; more than 500 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; so far this year in Punjab, a rich northern farming &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; where they hold a slight majority over Hindus. Soon after the blast in Batala, 25 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, Hindu mobs hurled stones at a police station 150 yards from the vegetable market, senior police superintendent S.K. Goel said. Goel was unsure whether any policemen were injured. The violence prompted officials to impose an indefinite curfew on the city, he said, adding that ``the situation is very tense.\\'\\' Most of those &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; were Hindus and the wounded included both Sikhs and Hindus, said Sanjeev Gupta, another senior police official. Thirty-two of those wounded were in serious condition. Goel said the bomb exploded during a march by about 100,000 Hindus celebrating the birth of Rama, a heroic warrior-king. Rama is extolled in Hindu lore as an incarnation of Vishnu, a member of the supreme Hindu trinity of gods. Witnesses, contacted by telephone, said portions of bodies were hurled across the market, which was covered with blood-soaked pieces of vegetables. ``Some &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were crying for help. Those who were lucky to survive ran away in panic. Many shops, scooters and one car were destroyed,\\'\\' said one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier today, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near Amritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, both Sikhs, senior police superintendent Anil Sharma said. Police blamed Sikh &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; for the blast near Taragarh, 17 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of Amritsar. Sikh Extremists initially targeted only Hindus in their campaign but now have also turned their guns on Sikhs who don\\'t support the separatist cause. On Monday night, Sikh &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; shot and &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; four members of a Sikh family in another part of Punjab, police said. At Salghowal, 95 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southeast of Amritsar, five or six Sikh gunmen burst into the farmhouse of a Sikh constable Monday night, killing the policeman, his parents and a younger brother, senior police superintendent Baramjit Singh said. Police also blamed Sikh &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; for an attack on a bus Monday night in Uttar Pradesh state, which is separated from Punjab by Haryana state, news agencies reported. United News of India said one police guard was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and 11 passengers were wounded when five gunmen stopped the bus. But a second police guard &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; one of the gunmen and the others fled, according to United News. Press Trust of India said police recovered a Chinese assault rifle bearing the inscription ``Khalistan Commando Force.\\'\\' Khalistan, which means ``Land of the Pure,\\'\\' is the name Sikh &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; use for the independent Sikh nation they want to create in Punjab. The bus was halted while traveling between Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar, about 75 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of New Delhi and about 95 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; from the Punjab-Haryana &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; line. Most attacks by Sikh &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; have occurred in Punjab. Nationwide, Sikhs comprise only 2 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of India\\'s 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; people, while Hindus account for 82 percent. The &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; say members of the Sikh faith, which has roots in both Islam and Hinduism, are discriminated against politically and culturally by the Hindu majority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  south north korea korean war roh games communist seoul talks kim sports visit olympic remains peninsula hyundai korea\\'s delegation team &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.552162424874947  \\n   South Korea launched regular ferry service with China today for the first time since the Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; was divided in 1945. A 4,300-ton ferryboat carrying 130 people left the western port city of Inchon for Weihai on China\\'s Shandong peninsula, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. The boat will leave Inchon twice a week, Yonhap said. It will fly a Panamanian flag because the two countries have no diplomatic relations. South Korea has strengthened economic and non-political ties with China, a close ally of Communist North Korea. In recent months it has also increased ties with the Soviet Union and most of the formerly Communist nations in Eastern Europe. China intervened on North Korea\\'s side in the 1950-53 &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; between the Koreas. The two Koreas have never signed a peace treaty, and hundreds of thousands of troops guard their borders. &lt;/p&gt; 0.526919836958041  \\n   The two Koreas met on the soccer field at Olympic Stadium today before more than 80,000 South Koreans, who cheered for both teams and roared approval for unification. South Korea\\'s national &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; won 1-0, but the score was insignificant beside the diplomatic coup in having two enemy nations share a playing field for only the second time since World War II. The first time was two weeks ago in North Korea, when the northern &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; beat the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; 2-1. Today\\'s crowd was the largest to see a South Korean &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; event since the 1988 Olympic Games. At the end of the game, spectators rose for a standing ovation as the athletes jogged around the stadium holding hands and waving. The teams exchanged shirts and waved them in the air. ``Our wish is unification,\\'\\' blared a unification song over the loudspeakers. The game, called North-South Unification Soccer, is the high point of a five-day &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; by a 78-member North Korean &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; delegation, the first from the Communist &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; since the 1945 division of the peninsula. South Korean soccer players visited the &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; earlier this month. That &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; was only the second civilian exchange between the countries in more than four decades. The soccer &lt;b&gt; delegation &lt;/b&gt; returns to North Korea on Friday after rounds of sightseeing, dinners and &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; on future &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; exchanges. South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong Sung and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, agreed in principle to form a joint single &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; for the 1992 Olympic Games and other international &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; events at &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; in Pyongyang. They said further discussions would be held in Seoul. About 5,000 plainclothes police were positioned inside and outside the stadium. Spectators were searched twice and passed through metal detectors to get to their seats. Scalpers were asking $140 for tickets, 10 times the highest face value price. The teams of the rival Koreas entered the stadium side by side, holding hands and waving to thunderous applause. ``This is not purely &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; festival,\\'\\' Kim said before the match began. ``It should lead to a unification festival.\\'\\' ``I hope this soccer match will be a spring board for national unification,\\'\\' Chung. Thousands roared in approval and waved colorful pompons. Spectators had been asked not to bring national flags, decorative placards or other paraphernalia which would be identified only with South Korea. A drum and bugle corps played and a gigantic electric signboard flashed the pictures of the ministers. The North Korean &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; threw half a dozen soccer balls signed with their signatures into the grandstand and screaming spectators raced to retrieve them. During the game, the South Korean crowd cheered wildly for plays by both teams. Radical students, who had said they would root for the North Korean visitors, were not visible. News reports said tickets were sold on an individual basis apparently to avoid large radical or dissident groups sitting together. The &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; exchange comes at a time when South Korea and North Korea are seeking to find ways to ease tensions and work together for unification. The prime ministers of both Koreas met for the second time last week in Pyongyang, the north\\'s capital, and have agreed to meet again in Seoul in December. A South Korean musicians\\' &lt;b&gt; delegation &lt;/b&gt; returns Wednesday from a 10-day &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; to the north. The Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; was divided into the Communist North and capitalist South in 1945 at the end of the World War II. The two nations fought a &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was never signed. The border between the Koreas &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; tightly sealed and is one of the most heavily fortified demarcations in the world with more than 1.5 million troops on either side. &lt;/p&gt; 0.486592565118984  \\n   Last month, Communist North Korea turned over what it said were the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of five U.S. servicemen killed in the Korean War. Now American officials say they\\'re not sure whose &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; they have. The &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; were handed over to to a U.S. congressional &lt;b&gt; delegation &lt;/b&gt; in an emotional Memorial Day ceremony in the truce village of Panmunjom in what was billed as the first return of U.S. Korean War dead since 1954. Only two of the five bodies were identified by name by the North Koreans, based on dogtags they said were found with them. They were U.S. Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah and Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, of Chester, Pa. But the United Nations Command said today that the bodies, which were sent to the Army\\'s Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu for identification, were not those of Saunders and Seaton. ``While North Korea has indicated name association for two of the five remains, dental and physical characteristics of the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; were compared with the dental and physical records of the those two individuals, with negative results,\\'\\' the command said. The command said its findings were preliminary, but said it did not appear that the other &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; returned were those of Saunders or Seaton either. ``Until the identification process is complete, we can\\'t even be sure they were the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of Americans,\\'\\' the command added. The soldiers\\' relatives have been told of the findings, the command said. The other three sets of &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; were not identified by North Korea, but it said at the time of the return that they were believed to be those of another Army servicemen and two U.S. Air Force members. All five were believed to have been prisoners of &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; who died in Hwanghae Pukto province, &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; of North Korea\\'s capital of Pyongyang. Saunders and Seaton had been listed as missing in February 1951, the Pentagon said. According to U.S. military, 8,172 U.S. soldiers remain unaccounted for from the war. The return of the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; was widely seen as a sign of healing and reconciliation after decades of emnity, an effort by North Korea to improve relations with the United States. The two countries do not have diplomatic ties. The United Nations Command says 33,629 U.S. soldiers were killed and 103,284 wounded in the war. More than 2 million Koreans were killed. The 16-nation command, led by an American general, was formed at the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War to help South Korea repel invaders from the North. There were large-scale returns of &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of U.S. &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; dead in 1953 and 1954. Then, after years of no returns, the North Koreans announced May 14 that they would turn over the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of the five. Ho Jong, North Korean\\'s deputy permanant representative at its U.N. mission, said at the time that the Communist government was prepared to discuss the return of more remains. He said the move was an ``eloquent illustration\\'\\' of North Korea\\'s wilingness to ``settle pending issues with the U.S. government in a good way.\\'\\' North Korea acknowledged for the first time in January 1988 that it was still holding the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of U.N. Command &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; dead. &lt;/p&gt; 0.439376559501793  \\n   Communist North Korea on Friday offered to open a small stretch of its border to promote unification with South Korea, but its capitalist rival dismissed the gesture as insignificant. The Communist overture came as the prime ministers of the two nations prepared to hold historic talks, perhaps as early as August. North Korea announced it would open the northern sector of Panmunjom, a border village, on Aug. 15, according to Naewoe Press, a semi-official South Korean news agency that specializes in Communist affairs. North Korea said the opening, about 800 yards long and 500 yards wide, was aimed at promoting unification of the Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; and urged South Korea to do the same, according to Naewoe. ``For successful progress of contact and visits between the &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; and the south, we will open the portion of our side ... and hope that the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; side will take a corresponding measure,\\'\\' the agency quoted the Communist government as saying. The opening, however, would not permit foreigners to travel inland, past the perimeter of Panmunjom, a truce village that straddles part of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas. The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a United Nations Command, comprising the United States and 15 other countries that fought with South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. No civilians may enter the area from either side without approval. South Korea\\'s Defense Ministry said it had not been officially notified of the north\\'s plans and would not comment on whether anyone would be allowed to cross the border. But a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity that North Korea\\'s move was ``insignificant\\'\\' because it affected only a small, restricted section of the heavily fortified border. Other officials said the move was aimed at dividing opinions in South Korea, where dissidents are pushing for free contacts with their Communist neighbors. The South Korean opposition welcomed the announcement. Dissidents asked Seoul to allow 300 people to meet with North Koreans at the border village Aug. 15, the day in 1945 that Korea was freed from Japanese colonial rule. But a spokesman for South Korea\\'s umbrella dissident group, Chonminyon, said the Seoul response had been negative. The South Korean government bans unauthorized border &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; with North Korea. After a five-month suspension, South Korean and North Korean officials have been meeting to discuss an accord that would outline terms for the first &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; between their prime ministers. On Tuesday, the Koreas agreed in principle to hold the prime ministers\\' meeting, possibly in August in Seoul. They agreed to adopt a formal accord July 26. Talks have been held sporadically between the two Koreas, but little progress had been made until recently. The border on both sides is heavily fortified and sealed, blocking exchanges of mail and transportation. North Korea is one of the last totalitarian Communist states, and sweeping changes in Eastern Europe and its socialist allies have made little impact. The two Koreas are still technically at war. No peace treaty has been signed since the three-year Korean War ended in 1953. &lt;/p&gt; 0.433794463538924  \\n   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today accused North Korea of trying to disrupt the Olympic Games and said the United States would beef up its military forces to stop any threat. ``Let me assure you that we will do all we can to help ensure the security of the 1988 Summer Olympics Games,\\'\\' he said. Communist North Korea continues to threaten peace on the divided Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; by refusing to work with South Korea to defuse the tension, Carlucci said. ``It is most unfortunate that the &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; continues its trouble-making role and &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; unwilling to make the simple concessions necessary to bring about a reduction in tensions on the peninsula,\\'\\' he said. Carlucci gave the assurance to South Korean defense officials at the start of the 20th annual U.S.-South Korea security conference to discuss mutual defense. South Korea Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok also stressed the North Korean threat to the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; and said the Olympics was adding to the tension. ``With the danger of their scheme to disrupt the coming Olympics remaining undiminished, military tension between &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; on the peninsla continues, thus posing a grave threat to the stability of Northeast Asia,\\'\\' he said. U.S. and South Korean delegates agreed during the &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; to build up their early warning systems to detect any possible North Korean military threat. Up to three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will help provide security for the Games, officials said. North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the demand, saying the Games are awarded to a single city. The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter opponents that have clashed repeatedly. The United States has about 42,000 U.S. troops based in the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; under a mutual defense pact. After meeting with Oh, Carlucci had lunch with President Roh Tae-woo and was awarded the Order of National Security. His scheduled visits later in the day with frontline American and South Korean troops were canceled due to bad weather, officials said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  spain hijackers crime spanish gunmen owen cain red saturday gotti hostages hijacking o\\'ferrell mafia suitcase plot italian libya barahona brigades &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.411058162177051  \\n   Police said they raided a Mafia summit Saturday and arrested five people meeting to draw up new territories for Naples\\' &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; families. The five were charged with criminal association of a Mafia type and with illegal possession of firearms. They are reputed leaders of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia. Authorities said the five met at the apartment of the boss of one Camorra gang and that the apartment had been under surveillance for months. The five were identified as Antonio Egizio, 35; his brother Umberto Egizio, 24; Vincenzo Romano, 28; Vincenzo de Michele, 36; and Salvatore Manna, 44. Police said Antonio Egizio recently sent a letter to President Francesco Cossiga complaining that he was a good person who was continously being persecuted, stopped and followed by the police. &lt;/p&gt; 0.387572594340656  \\n   Reputed mob boss John Gotti was described as ``God\\'s gift to the underworld\\'\\' in tapes secretly recorded by law enforcement agents and played Wednesday to jurors at his assault and conspiracy trial. Prosecutors say Gotti, 49, became boss of the Gambino &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; family, largest of New York\\'s five Mafia factions, in December 1985 after then-boss Paul Castellano was gunned down in front of a steak house. Transcripts of the tapes, which were released to the news media, show Gotti concerned about keeping underlings, including lifelong friends, in their place. At least once on the tapes, Gotti uses the term ``Cosa Nostra\\' when he is apparently telling an unidentified man that mob soldiers should not address him directly on business matters but should go through their ``capos,\\'\\' or captains. The tapes also indicate a relationship with the Westies, a vicious Irish-American gang that operates on Manhattan\\'s West Side. The Westies are a key factor in Gotti\\'s trial with associate Anthony Guerrieri, 60, on charges of assault and conspiracy in the 1986 revenge shooting of John F. O\\'Connor, former vice president of a Carpenters Union local. Gotti is accused of commissioning the Westies to shoot and wound O\\'Connor because the union leader had thugs trash a restaurant owned by Gotti associate Philip ``Philly\\'\\' Modica. The transcripts show at least one mention by Gotti of the restaurant and several comments on the Westies. At one point Gotti says ``...they\\'re doing something for me them Irish guys...,\\'\\' but does not say what. At another point, Gotti refers to James Coonan as ``my friend\\'\\' who is ``the leader of the West Side gang, Irish guys.\\'\\' He also says, ``He\\'s on the payroll, and he gets it legitimately ...\\'\\' The tapes were introduced by Edward Wright, an investigator with the state\\'s Organized Crime Task Force. Wright said the alleged mobsters, suspecting they might be under surveillance, turned on hair dryers, flushed toilets, whispered and used other means to try to make conversations inaudible. The tapes were made from listening devices placed in Gotti\\'s hangout in the borough of Qeens and monitored by police between June 19, 1985, and Feb. 26, 1986. More than 1,000 cassettes were recorded, prosecutors say. One 1986 tape shows Gotti in a telephone conversation quoting someone who praised him: ``When they say God\\'s gift to the underworld, you are it. ``He speaks with his heart,\\'\\' Gotti said on the telephone. ``He means it. I tell ya something, I love the guy.\\'\\' On another tape, Gotti expressed annoyance with lifelong friend Angelo Ruggiero for his familiarity during business hours. ``I told Ange, `You gotta forget them liberties you take. Take `em when we\\'re alone,\\'\\'\\' Gotti said. Gotti apparently had just made Ruggiero a ``caporegime,\\'\\' or crew captain, according to the tape transcripts, and was not satisfied that his friend was acting like a leader. Ruggiero, a defendant in the O\\'Connor case with Gotti, died of natural causes last month. &lt;/p&gt; 0.317650341569912  \\n   The Town Council has resigned to protest reports its members are suspected of ties with the Mafia. The councilmen followed the lead of the mayor, Paolo Scarna. He quit after a nephew was suspected of killing a judge last month who was ruling on whether purported Mafia members should be kept under house arrest, news reports said Friday. The resignations of the 32 council members came amid reports that police were investigating local politicians for possible links with organized crime. The town of 25,000 people, one of the poorest in Sicily, is in the province of Agrigento, an area that over the last few years has seen many slayings linked to the mob, including the murder of two anti-Mafia magistrates. Italy\\'s top anti-Mafia fighter, Magistrate Domenico Sica, has looked into possible Mafia activity in the town. In Palermo, meanwhile, officials announced on Friday that police have arrested 12 people suspected of drug-trafficking and money-laundering. The arrests came in a nationwide sweep that began Thursday night and involved searches of houses and business offices in Palermo, Rome, Milan and the northern cities of Como and Asti, police officials said. Those arrested were held for investigation of suspected organized &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; ties that involved drug dealing and money laundering. Investigators said they were aided by the testimony of a former mobster-turned-informer and by the discovery in January of a ledger that police say contained entries on Mafia financial transactions. The ledger was found in the house of a fugitive suspected Mafia boss. The drugs appeared to have moved directly from Turkey to Sicily and the drug profits appeared to have been laundered through Swiss banks, the Italian news agency AGI reported. &lt;/p&gt; 0.313418487504187  \\n   Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, a close friend and adviser of Premier Ciriaco De Mita, was shot to death Saturday at his home in northern Italy. An anonymous caller said Red Brigades terrorists were responsible. Investigators told Italian news agencies the body of the 51-year-old Christian Democrat senator was found on a couch in his living room at Forli, 40 miles southeast of Bologna. They said he was shot in the back of the neck. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said an anonymous telephone caller to the Bologna office of the Rome newspaper La Repubblica asserted responsibility on behalf of the Red Brigades. The spokesman quoted the caller as saying, ``We have killed Senator Ruffilli, attacking at the heart of the state. Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party.\\'\\' President Francesco Cossiga said: ``Our institutions and all the forces that are alive in the country will know how to act with firmness for the defense of liberty and of right. ``The assassination of Sen. Roberto Ruffilli is a horrendous &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; against the most sacred of human values _ life. It is an abominable attack on the parliamentary and representative institutions which are the fulcrum of our democratic state.\\'\\' Maurizio Laudi, a magistrate who has investigated the terrorist group, was quoted by the news agency AGI as saying the Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party is the most dangerous and active group in what remains of the Red Brigades. He said it also is the most difficult to penetrate. AGI said Ruffilli had received threatening phone calls in recent days. He led the Christian Democrat committee on problems of the state and was working with the premier on institutional reform. Ruffilli also was on the parliamentary commission that investigated the P-2 Masonic Lodge scandal. Premier De Mita convened a special meeting Saturday night of Interior Minister Antonio Gava and the chiefs of the Italy\\'s police forces. ``The criminal warning of the terrorists could not have been any clearer,\\'\\' he said. ``It has the same clarity with which 10 years ago through the person of Aldo Moro they aimed at his political program.\\'\\' Red Brigades terrorists kidnapped and killed Moro, a former premier, in 1978. According to the news agency ANSA, investigators at Ruffilli\\'s home found the door open and no signs of forced entry. State-run RAI television said the assassins fled on foot after the shooting at about 1 p.m. In a dispatch quoting government sources it did not identify, AGI said the car bombing that killed five people and wounded 17 at a Naples club for U.S. military personnel Thursday night may have inspired terrorists to kill Rufilli. An American servicewoman and four Italians were killed in the blast. The murder of air force Gen. Licio Giorgieri in Rome on March 20, 1987, was the last terrorist act for which a branch of the Red Brigades claimed responsibility. A month before that, the Red Brigades for the Formation of Fighting Communist Party claimed responsibility for an armored car robbery in Rome. In December 1981, Red Brigade terrorists disguised as plumbers kidnapped U.S. Brig. Gen. James Dozier, who was with the NATO command in Italy, from his home in Verona. He was rescued 42 days later by a special police unit in Padua. In February 1984, terrorists in Rome fatally shot Leamon Hunt, a U.S. diplomat and director-general of the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. The Red Brigades claimed responsibility. &lt;/p&gt; 0.301221604585091  \\n   The bulk of one of the world\\'s most important private art collections will hang in Spain for at least 10 years under an agreement signed Thursday. The arrival of 700 to 800 of the $2 billion Thyssen collection\\'s most significant paintings will cement the Spanish capital\\'s reputation as a leading world art center. The agreement was signed by collector Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and the Spanish government. The ceremony took place across the street from Prado museum in the 19th-century Villahermosa Palace, which Spanish authorities are refurbishing to devote exclusively to the new works. The collection is expected to open to the public in November. Thyssen said his decision to chose Spain over museums in the United States, Switzerland and West Germany was ``completely objective\\'\\' but stressed that his ties to Spain played a deciding role. The Baron\\'s fifth wife, Spanish-born Carmen Cervera, was an important factor in the final decision, according one of the plan\\'s chief architects, the Duke of Badajoz, who also is the brother-in-law of King Juan Carlos. Cervera, a former beauty queen and widow of ``Tarzan\\'\\' actor Lex Barker, ``has a great influence over her husband,\\'\\' he said. The duke said Thyssen had not yet completed the choice of which paintings would make up the Madrid collection, but the agreement stipulates they include ``the most significant paintings\\'\\' of the Thyssen collection. The duke said the 10-year loan agreement paves the way for a second pact to make Spain the collection\\'s permanent home. ``It takes away a bit of the tension,\\'\\' he said. ``Now we can proceed with calm to work out the definitive agreement.\\'\\' A beaming Culture Minister Javier Solana said the collection ``is going to fundamentally improve the cultural life of our country.\\'\\' The Swiss-based Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Trust, headed by the baron, owns 1,600 paintings from the 13th to 20th centuries, including 570 old masters. The collection was started by his father, Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a German steel baron who died in 1947. News that Thyssen was looking for a bigger home for the bulk of the paintings currently housed at his Villa Favorita residence in Lugano, Switzerland, elicited offers from Spain, the Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., and museums in several West German cities. The 10-year loan is to be administered by a private foundation set up by the Spanish government and Thyssen, and chaired by the baron. The agreement stipulates that the pieces on loan to Spain will be able to travel freely to other museums without prior approval from Spanish authorities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  dollar yen late london gold bid ounce dealers fell trading troy bank tokyo price west rates francs currency compared close &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.895672441142999  \\n   The &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; fell &lt;/b&gt; against most major currencies in European &lt;b&gt; trading &lt;/b&gt; today.

Foreign exchange &lt;b&gt; dealers &lt;/b&gt; said the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; bounced back in Europe from lows hit during the Tokyo &lt;b&gt; trading &lt;/b&gt; day on support from a third day of intervention from Japan\\'s central bank, the Bank of Japan, and fear of the same by the U.S. Federal Reserve. But they said sentiment remained essentially bearish, although the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; was unlikely to fall sharply ahead of the U.S. election. ``The nearer we come to the election the calmer the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; will be,\\'\\' said one trader in Milan.

Dollar &lt;b&gt; trading &lt;/b&gt; was lackluster as investors squared their positions in advance of the weekend and Wednesday\\'s scheduled release of balance of trade figures for October. Jack Barbanel, a market analyst for Gruntal &amp; Co., predicted the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; would remain stable until the report is released. Overseas, &lt;b&gt; dealers &lt;/b&gt; said the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; was pressured lower by strength in the West German mark. They said the mark rose amid speculation that the Bundesbank would raise its Lombard rate by a half percentage point to 5.5 percent. The Lombard rate is the interest the central &lt;b&gt; bank &lt;/b&gt; charges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as collateral. In Frankfurt, the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; slipped to 1.7330 marks from 1.7420 &lt;b&gt; late &lt;/b&gt; Thursday. In New York, it &lt;b&gt; fell &lt;/b&gt; to 1.73525 marks from 1.73865.

Later, in London, it was quoted higher at 122.30 yen, and in New York, the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; rose to 122.49 &lt;b&gt; yen &lt;/b&gt; from 122.30 &lt;b&gt; late &lt;/b&gt; Thursday. In London, the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; gained against the British pound. It cost $1.8490 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8510 Thursday.

Gold prices were slightly higher. ``There is no evidence of a trend in the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; right now,\\'\\' one Milan trader said. Traders said attention continued to focus on the weakness of the Japanese yen. Anticipation was strong that monetary authorities would move to shore up the Japanese &lt;b&gt; currency &lt;/b&gt; after the market shrugged off an increase in Japanese interest &lt;b&gt; rates &lt;/b&gt; earlier this week. Traders said the West German mark was suffering from continuing uncertainty about the costs of German reunification. In Tokyo, where &lt;b&gt; trading &lt;/b&gt; ends as Europe\\'s business day begins, the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; rose 0.24 &lt;b&gt; yen &lt;/b&gt; to a closing 155.07 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 155.00 yen. In London, the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; fell &lt;/b&gt; against the British pound, which was quoted at $1.6040, &lt;b&gt; compared &lt;/b&gt; with $1.6015 &lt;b&gt; late &lt;/b&gt; Thursday.

Gold rose slightly in Zurich. ``The market is really dead because London is absent,\\'\\' said one trader in Rome. In Tokyo, where &lt;b&gt; trading &lt;/b&gt; ends as Europe\\'s business day begins, the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; gained sharply, closing up 0.70 &lt;b&gt; yen &lt;/b&gt; at 134.20 yen. Later, in Europe, it was quoted at 134.25 yen. Foreign exchange &lt;b&gt; dealers &lt;/b&gt; attributed the dollar\\'s strong performance in Tokyo to loss-cutting and said orders concentrated there because other major markets were closed. Hong Kong\\'s financial institutions were also closed today for a national holiday. ``Those who had sold the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; at around 133.80 &lt;b&gt; yen &lt;/b&gt; bought it back above the 134-yen level today,\\'\\' said a dealer at a U.S. bank\\'s Tokyo office. ``That caused the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; to gain sharply.\\'\\' Other &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rates &lt;/b&gt; in Europe at midmorning, &lt;b&gt; compared &lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt; late &lt;/b&gt; Friday\\'s London rates: _1.8663 West German marks, up from 1.8565 _1.5760 Swiss francs, up from 1.5655 _6.3372 French francs, up from 6.3010 _2.1077 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0970 _1,386.25 Italian lire, down from 1,380.50 _1.2375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23725 In Europe, the &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; made solid gains against the British pound. One pound cost $1.6855, &lt;b&gt; compared &lt;/b&gt; with $1.7025 in London &lt;b&gt; late &lt;/b&gt; Friday. The London bullion markets were closed for the holiday, but in Zurich the &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; price &lt;/b&gt; for &lt;b&gt; gold &lt;/b&gt; was $432.35, up slightly from $432.00 &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; late &lt;/b&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  dukakis campaign jackson democratic convention presidential republican george bentsen michael vice bush primary told massachusetts support delegates state running democrats &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.553036649286314  \\n   Former President Carter described Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis as ``highly competent\\'\\' on Tuesday and said Dukakis would fare well against Republican George Bush in the Nov. 8 general election. ``I know him well. He and I were governors together,\\'\\' said Carter, who was governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and won the presidency in 1976. Carter said the Massachusetts governor ``is highly competent. I think among all the governors, he would be voted one of the top ones in administrative ability, in vision and competence and sound judgment.\\'\\' Carter said Dukakis\\' nomination was ``the obvious likelihood now\\'\\' and predicted ``he will do well\\'\\' against Bush. As a former Democratic president, Carter is a delegate to the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; in Atlanta this summer. He said it is still his intention to go to the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; as an uncommitted delegate because he &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; the candidates earlier that he would not choose among them until the convention. &lt;/p&gt; 0.51658736644396  \\n   Illinois Republican Gov. James Thompson came to this &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; city to taunt the Democrats, but wound up hinting that he\\'d make a good &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate for GOP candidate George Bush. As the Democrats embraced the ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, who differ on a number of issues, Thompson stressed his compatibility with the &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. ``George Bush and I agree on a lot of things,\\'\\' said Thompson, a four-term governor who was an early Bush supporter. ``I\\'m too moderate for some people, but I\\'ve never been &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; I\\'m too moderate for George Bush,\\'\\' he said. Thompson was careful to avoid sounding overly eager as a job applicant. Vice &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; hopefuls traditionally refrain from tooting their own horns. ``There are a number of qualified candidates,\\'\\' Thompson said. ``There\\'s no lack of talent in our party.\\'\\' Thompson\\'s &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; gave Bush a boost in the Illinois primary, where he thrashed his GOP rivals after an impressive showing in the South. Since then, Thompson has been mentioned as a &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; prospect, and ``Thompson-Bush\\'\\' bumper stickers have appeared in Springfield, the Illinois capital. Thompson was in Atlanta on Wednesday to carry the GOP banner. He clearly relished the task, signaling what\\'s certain to be a Republican effort to focus attention on Jesse Jackson as part of the Democratic team. ``Gov. Dukakis has accepted Jesse Jackson as his partner in this campaign, elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps higher than his nominal &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate, Lloyd Bentsen,\\'\\' Thompson &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; reporters. Thompson said it was a clever strategy by Dukakis to offer Bentsen as ``the soothing, reassuring conservative.\\'\\' But he said, ``my guess is those two partners of the troika, Dukakis and Jackson, will soon leave Bentsen in the dust.\\'\\' Thompson added: ``With Bentsen whispering in one ear and Jackson whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen to? ... I think that\\'s the question the American people need to have answered.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.498473725482628  \\n   Talk of a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; is making some Democrats shudder, while former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip\\'\\' O\\'Neill says he thinks it would be a lot of fun and other party leaders say the scenario probably will be avoided one way or another. ``A brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; is nothing,\\'\\' said O\\'Neill on Wednesday evening. He recalled the brokered 1952 &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; that nominated Adlai Stevenson and said, ``It was enjoyable ... it makes it more fun.\\'\\' ``If I had my way _ they talk about the smoke-filled rooms _ we ought to open them up to the TV and the press,\\'\\' he said in an interview Wednesday night. Sen. Paul Simon\\'s favorite-son &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; victory in Illinois on Tuesday brought the brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; speculation to the fore, along with concerns that the Democrats could only be hurt by such a lack of unity. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who some hope would emerge the nominee if there were a deadlocked convention, condemned the possibility as ``the best way to give this election away to the Republicans.\\'\\' He joined Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk in calling for the Democratic leadership to unify behind the front-runner when the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; season ends in June, rather than wait until the July &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; in Atlanta. Simon, reviving his faltering campaign, took most of the &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; in Illinois, with the other home-state candidate, Jesse Jackson, coming in second and taking the rest of the delegates. Simon said no one will have enough &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to lock up the nomination before the convention, and added, ``We\\'re going to have to work out some kind of a compromise.\\'\\' Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who currently holds a slim lead in delegates, said the party should unite behind the front-runner at the end of the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; season, and that encouraging a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; ``would be a very dangerous thing.\\'\\' ``I think there is agreement on the part of most Democrats across the country that somebody will come out of this &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; process with, if not an absolute majority, a substantial plurality ... and that people will rally behind that person. Obviously, I hope I will be that person,\\'\\' the governor said in Boston. But other prominent Democrats, interviewed Wednesday at a congressional dinner, professed not to be worried about the deadlocked &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; prospect, mostly because they don\\'t think it will come to that. ``Nobody said the process had to end by March,\\'\\' said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But he said he thinks his candidate, Dukakis, will have enough &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to take the nomination by June, and that ``the process is going to work its way out.\\'\\' Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, who opted not to seek the &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; nomination this year, said he doubts anyone will have a winning cache of &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; in June. But he predicted that the party would unite behind a candidate before the convention. Nonetheless, he added, ``I don\\'t fear a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; ... I don\\'t think any harm comes from it.\\'\\' After Illinois, Dukakis had 464.5 delegate votes, Jackson 460.55 and Simon 171.5. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee had 354.8 and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri 145. Uncommitted &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; totaled 272.65 of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination. Boosted by his Illinois win, Simon plans to &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; vigorously for the upcoming Michigan caucuses March 26 and the Wisconsin &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; April 5. Gore, who fared poorly in Illinois, said he is ``almost prepared\\'\\' to agree that the race will still be fluid at the convention. ``I still think this process is likely to produce a winner before the first ballot is over,\\'\\' Gore said. ``The results (from Illinois) ... make it more likely we will go to a second ballot.\\'\\' Gephardt, who skipped Illinois to try to resuscitate his &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; in Michigan, said the Democratic battle could go all the way. ``The race is wide open,\\'\\' he said in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``I think if I can get a good result in Michigan, which I think I can, I\\'m going to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great chance to be the nominee.\\'\\' House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said Wednesday night he anticipated he would be involved in any discussions to unite behind a candidate before the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; if no one had the winning number of &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; in June. He said a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; wouldn\\'t be the worst thing, but added, ``All things considered, it would be desirable if it didn\\'t happen.\\'\\' Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey on Wednesday signaled the likelihood that he, too, would help in early selection of a nominee. First, he &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; party leaders in his home &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; that he would endorse a candidate before the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; there June 7, with Dukakis the favorite for his backing. And he said party leaders should halt an effort to put together an uncommitted delegate slate for the state. Victory for such a slate, he said, could cause problems for the front-running candidate when the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; is held. &lt;/p&gt; 0.479709693591917  \\n   Michael Dukakis, the clear Democratic front-runner after beating Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. in New York, said today the party\\'s runner-up after the primaries won\\'t necessarily be the &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; choice. Gore, conceding ``things didn\\'t turn out exactly as I planned,\\'\\' suspended his &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; but said he would hang on to the &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; he\\'s won so far. ``I want no part of a stop-Jackson or stop-Dukakis movement. The only man I want to stop is George Bush and we\\'re going to stop George Bush, Gore said, bringing applause from supporters at a news conference in a Senate office building. ``Technically, I shall remain a candidate for the nomination but only to enable my &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to go to the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; so they can represent our point of view in our party\\'s deliberations,\\'\\' he said. Gore, the youngest candidate in the race, joked that in the campaign, ``I was doing great until I turned 40.\\'\\' Jackson, in Pennsylvania, brushed aside surveys suggesting he faces an uphill fight in next week\\'s &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; in that state. ``I do not follow opinion polls, I mold opinion,\\'\\' Jackson &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; cheering supporters in Philadelphia. Gore\\'s decision to merely suspend his &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; followed a similar action by Sen. Paul Simon earlier. Both Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning today in Pennsylvania, where 178 Democratic &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; are at stake on Tuesday. Dukakis was going on to Ohio, which holds its &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; a week later. Dukakis, asked about a potential &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate during an interview with The Associated Press, said, ``I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks as if it\\'s pretty well in hand.\\'\\' Some Jackson backers were beginning to float the idea of Jackson as a possible &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate if Dukakis were the nominee. ``There would be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket,\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; chairman Willie Brown &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; The New York Times. But Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said such a ticket was unlikely. Kirk, in comments published in today\\'s Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said, ``Only once in 19 elections since the turn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placed second and asked him to run. It was 1960.\\'\\' Dukakis himself said, ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn\\'t entitle me to anything more than consideration, period.\\'\\' He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer questions about the &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; presidency away from Jackson. ``The nominee makes that decision _ as he (Jackson) himself said. And rightly so,\\'\\' Dukakis said. On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush continued his march to the nomination, with 1,052 of the 1,139 &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; needed to nominate. Bush was endorsed Wednesday by California Gov. George Deukmejian, who had initially pledged neutrality through the June 7 California primary. But Bush\\'s only remaining competitor is Pat Robertson, who has all but halted his campaign. Simon\\'s suspension of his Democratic &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; earlier this month drew fire from Jackson, who complained bitterly about the Illinois\\' senator\\'s decision to keep a lock on &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; that would otherwise have gone to him. Jackson &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; spokesman Bob Brosage brushed aside talk of Jackson as &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. ``We\\'re still &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; for president,\\'\\' he said. ``There are significant primaries to come.\\'\\' And Jackson himself gave no indication he\\'s giving up his drive for the nomination. ``We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,\\'\\' he &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; an enthusiastic crowd of 3,500 at a Philadelphia rally. Jackson was also picking up the endorsement today of the Philadelphia Daily News. A survey commissioned by the newspaper, in concert with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, suggested this week that Dukakis had a 3-1 lead in the state. Even so, ``Jesse Jackson can win,\\'\\' the Daily News said in an editorial. Financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission indicated Jackson had his best fund-raising month ever in March, raising $2.8 million. But Dukakis, whose &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; has been well bankrolled all along, raised $3.4 million during the same period. Jackson\\'s stops in Pennsylvania today ranged from a high school to a labor rally to a homeless shelter. Dukakis was heading for Pittsburgh tonight, after spending a day in Boston following the New York primary. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, at a Democratic dinner in Washington Wednesday night, was eager to move beyond the raucous contest in his home state. ``I expect the &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; will be converted to an intelligent, civilized exchange of opinions,\\'\\' he said. Dukakis is comfortably ahead of Jackson in the delegate count, getting a boost Wednesday from the selection of congressional ``super delegates.\\'\\' The latest Associated Press delegate count gives Dukakis 1,063.15; Jackson 841.1; Gore 421.55; and uncommitted 613.75, out of 2,081 needed to nominate. But Dukakis was doing his best to dampen any talk of inevitability. When he was introduced at a Statehouse reception in Massachusetts as ``the next president of the United States,\\'\\' he grinned but quickly cautioned: ``Steady as she goes.\\'\\' In one respect, however, Dukakis was behaving as if he were the nominee, focusing attacks on Bush, who is all but certain to carry the GOP banner in the fall. ``I\\'m a doer,\\'\\' Dukakis said Wednesday, saying that characteristic stands in ``sharp contrast to the Republican nominee.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.451467600268355  \\n   Democratic &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; contender Michael Dukakis said today at the White House that the Reagan administration\\'s anti-terrorist policy is worthless because of arms dealing with Iran. In the Midwest Republican Bob Dole taunted George Bush for refusing to compete in Minnesota and South Dakota. Dukakis, speaking to reporters after a National Governors\\' Association meeting with the president, said, ``I\\'d have a much tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy.\\'\\' The Massachusetts governor, referring to the sale of arms to Iran during secret negotiations to free American hostages, said, ``We\\'ll be living with the consequences of what happened in 1985 for a long time.\\'\\' ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless. And that\\'s what we did,\\'\\' said Dukakis. Asked about Dukakis\\' statement, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I think it\\'s very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you\\'re talking about specific episodes. Vice President Bush, who has said repeatedly he supported Reagan\\'s Iran initiative but was involved with few details, was campaigning in South Carolina today. But Dole, in Duluth, Minn., was suggesting Bush wasn\\'t where he should have been. Minnesota and South Dakota, the next two events on the long road to the 1988 &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; nominations, vote on Tuesday. ``We\\'re ready to do well here tomorrow. We\\'re here to play,\\'\\' Dole &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; supporters in Duluth today. ``I don\\'t know where George Bush is,\\'\\' Dole said. ``I didn\\'t find him yesterday in Wyoming. Couldn\\'t find him in South Dakota. Couldn\\'t find him in Minnesota. Must be somewhere. And these are very important states. Later today we\\'re going to send him a map of Minnesota so at least he gets a little idea where it is.\\'\\' Among the Democrats, Richard Gephardt, who also finished first in Iowa, is bidding for a strong showing in South Dakota\\'s Democratic straw poll to give him a boost as the &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; moves toward the Super Tuesday showdown on March 8. The 4,067 Minnesota caucuses are the first step toward choosing 78 &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to the Democratic National Convention, while on the Republican side caucus attendees will mark a non-binding straw ballot to express their &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; preference. In South Dakota\\'s primary, Republican voters will determine allocation of 18 &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; delegates, while the Democrats will hold a beauty contest ballot that will not have a binding effect on who gets the state\\'s national &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; delegates. Bush, faced with the potential of a repeat of the Iowa results in which Midwesterner Dole was a big winner, is concentrating on the South where he hopes to cripple the Kansas senator\\'s effort. Dole is a strong favorite in South Dakota, while Minnesota is shaping up as a three-way fight between Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former television evangelist Pat Robertson. Dukakis, winner of the New Hampshire Democratic &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; primary, is campaigning hard in both these upper Midwest states in an effort to prove he can win &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; outside his native New England. After an appearance at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, including a session with President Reagan, Dukakis was flying to Minnesota to campaign. On his way into the White House for a black-tie dinner Sunday night, Dukakis quipped, ``I\\'m just looking the place over, that\\'s all.\\'\\' Asked where he hoped to be next year, Dukakis replied, ``I hope right here.\\' Gephardt, who has made tough action to correct trade imbalances a cornerstone of his campaign, got a blow from his House colleagues when words came out they planned to scuttle his legislation that would impose sanctions on countries that maintain large trade surpluses with the United States through unfair practices. ``We\\'re going to dump it because it\\'s bad policy,\\'\\' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the Trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``I\\'m going to fight for my amendment,\\'\\' said Gephardt, when &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; of the plan. Much of the sniping between &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; rivals was being done by long distance. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who made little effort in Iowa and not much more in New Hampshire while pursuing a Southern strategy for the Democratic nomination, was interviewed on the NBC show ``Meet the Press\\'\\' on Sunday and got in jabs at both Dukakis and Gephardt. The senator attacked Gephardt for shifting positions. ``It\\'s not a case of just having one or two or three issues where he has changed 180 degrees,\\'\\' said Gore. ``There is a long, long list of issues.\\'\\' Turning to Dukakis, Gore said the governor has not had ``a single day\\'s experience in foreign policy.\\'\\' Dukakis\\' spokesman Leslie Dach quickly retorted that ``Al Gore\\'s never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building an economy.\\'\\' Gephardt was attacking Dukakis in ads &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; in South Dakota that criticize the Massachusetts governor for not supporting farm legislation sponsored by Gephardt and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. The ads also take a shot at Dukakis for once suggesting in Iowa that farmers ought to consider diversifying into such crops as Belgian endive. The ads drew retorts from Dukakis supporters in both Minnesota and South Dakota. ``A new low in South Dakota &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; politics,\\'\\' said State Sen. Roger McKellips, a co-chairman of Dukakis\\' South Dakota campaign. After his surprising second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Robertson was considered a strong contender in Minnesota where caucus organization is once again important. The former evangelist was in Spartanburg, S.C., on Sunday and &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; a crowd of about 4,000 at a church dedication that ``the problem facing America is not a government problem but a moral problem.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  immigration united cuba states cuban illegal aliens cubans czechoslovakia havel communist ins prague castro czechoslovak embassy diplomatic havana apply justice &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.392362370466602  \\n   Since the prison disturbances by Mariel Cuban detainees last fall, the government has released more than 1,000 of the detainees into halfway houses or with family sponsors in communities, the Justice Department announced Friday. One of the triggers to last year\\'s uprisings at federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was the fact that the government was taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were deemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for the detainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble finding halfway house space for the detainees. From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in November, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released 106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A total of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances. INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots. Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the denials have been decided since the uprisings. When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detainees in various facilities. The Justice Department also announced it plans to repatriate 14 Mariel Cubans, the first group of detainees designated for return to Cuba since the prison disturbances. The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences for crimes committed in the United States, have been notified that the INS intends to send them back, the Justice Department said. Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of crimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape. The repatriation process will include a review of their cases by a Justice Department review panel under an agreement which ended the rioting at Atlanta and Oakdale. Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to submit additional information on their behalf to the Justice Department review panels, which specifically exclude &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; officers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.376502286739609  \\n   A 101-year-old Mexican who was smuggled into the United States in the back seat of his son\\'s car 14 years ago became the oldest alien to gain legal status under the amnesty program, officials said Friday. ``Gracias, muchas gracias a todos (Thank you very much everyone),\\'\\' Carlos Romero-Gaitan said as he was presented a temporary residency permit, or green card, by Howard Ezell, western regional director the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In recent weeks, Ezell and other INS officials have taken pains to publicize the impending May 4 deadline to &lt;b&gt; apply &lt;/b&gt; for amnesty. Romero-Gaitan, who was born in San Pedro, worked on a hacienda and as a rodeo rider, and operated a Guadalajara tortilla shop until his retirement at age 82 in 1968. When his wife died in 1974, his son Carlos Jr. of Watsonville, Calif., flew to Guadalajara and took him by plane to Tijuana, where they got into a waiting car. With the father asleep in the back, Carlos Jr. drove to the border. ``They (the Border Patrol) asked everyone else in the car for identification, but they didn\\'t want to disturb the man who was asleep, so he got through clean,\\'\\' INS spokesman Joe Flanders said. Flanders said Romero-Gaitan has lived ever since in Watsonville, tending the family\\'s garden, watching cowbody shows and boxing matches on television and venturing out to an annual rodeo in the Salinas area. Romero-Gaitan said Friday that he decided to &lt;b&gt; apply &lt;/b&gt; for amnesty now ``so I can feel free to go out of my house and not be afraid of being picked up.\\'\\' Four of his five children are alive and live in the United States and Mexico.

CTK quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the grace period should permit Havana ``to cope with the new situation, without jeopardizing its interests in the U.S.A.\\'\\' The Czechoslovak Embassy has represented Cuban interests in Washington since 1977. Diplomatic and consular ties between Cuba and the United States were severed in January 1961. Interests sections enable countries to maintain &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; contact without having to have full-fledged embassies. A senior Cuban &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; official in Washington, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the Cuban government has no alternate plan in mind at present to replace the current arrangement with the Czechoslovak government. He said he assumes both the Cuban and U.S. governments wish to maintain a &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; presence in each other\\'s capital and that Cuba will seek a new arrangement. The official said he had seen news reports about Prague\\'s decision but had heard nothing officially. U.S. &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; activities in Havana have been carried out under the auspices of the Swiss embassy. One &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; source suggested that Cuba may ask the Swiss to perform that function for Cuba in Washington. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry source as saying that ``the different opinions of the two countries on the exercising of human rights\\'\\' and other fundamental differences prompted the Czechoslovak decision. Czechoslovakia has become a democracy following the revolution that toppled the Communist leadership one year ago; Cuba remains Communist-ruled. The ministry source suggested that deteriorating relations after Czechoslovakia embraced democracy contributed to Prague\\'s decision, CTK said. He singled out the storming of Czechoslovak &lt;b&gt; embassy &lt;/b&gt; premises in Havana in July by Cubans who claimed they were dissidents but who the Czechoslovaks believe were in the pay of the Cuban government. The invasion of the &lt;b&gt; embassy &lt;/b&gt; ``can be rightfully presumed to have been intended to discredit the new Czechoslovak regime in the eyes of the Cuban public,\\'\\' CTK quoted the source as saying. Efforts to contact the Czechoslovak &lt;b&gt; embassy &lt;/b&gt; in Washington by telephone were unavailing. &lt;/p&gt; 0.365187116447699  \\n   At least 12 Mariel prisoners have apparently exhausted their administrative appeals and could be deported within days, but plans are in the works by prisoner advocates to block any deportations, a newspaper reported Thursday. Gary Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed by the Justice Department that there would be an announcement Thursday on the prisoners. Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in Miami and Atlanta plan to ask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried out would mark the first time Cubans have been deported to their &lt;b&gt; communist &lt;/b&gt; homeland since May 1985, The Miami Herald reported. ``There is a chance if we all speak with one &lt;b&gt; united &lt;/b&gt; voice here and explain the merits of our case,\\'\\' said Rafael Penalver, chairman of the Task Force of Cuban American Citizen Organizations. Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in Oakdale, La., and at an Atlanta prison last November. ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He can block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the airport.\\'\\' A special three-member Justice Department panel was created in the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Mariel detainees in federal prison in Talladega, Ala. In the past two months, the panel has looked at prison records, &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; history, written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but there have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers. Deportations to Cuba were reinstated as part of a renewed &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; pact between the United States and Cuba that allows up to 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families to emigrate and, in return, the Cuban government will take back 2,500 prisoners. The Justice Department contends that these prisoners are criminals the Cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from the port of Mariel. Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of Mariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984 &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; pact. Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, acknowledges there is much division over the deporations, even in Dade County\\'s Cuban exile community. He said the foundation favors letting Cubans &lt;b&gt; apply &lt;/b&gt; for visas to immigrate to the United States but opposes the deportations to Cuba. ``I cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation in Cuba and then support sending them back,\\'\\' Mas said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.363299074150423  \\n   An attorney for 13 Cuban detainees argued Tuesday they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylum before being sent back to the homeland they fled in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Lee Ochoa of Miami, an attorney for 13 of 15 Cubans convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, told U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon that some of the Cubans were afraid to go home because they did not know how they would be treated by Fidel Castro\\'s government. Clemon said he will rule Monday on whether to allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to fly the 13 back to Cuba. Clemon said he wanted to give attorneys for the Cubans time to support their request for a preliminary order blocking the deportation. The INS on Nov. 17 notified 15 Cubans at at the Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega that they would be deported within 72 hours. However, the next day the government promised Clemon it would not send them home until their attorneys had a chance to study their files. Leo Ochoa of Miami, attorney for 13 of the 15, told Clemon that they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym and to due process. ``In this country we want to do things fairly and properly,\\'\\' Ochoa said. But Lauri Fillppu of the INS said that the Cubans\\' only claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in Cuba. He said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court in Atlanta already had rejected that argument. Fillppu questioned what he called ``a last-minute tactic\\'\\' by the Cubans, claiming there was no new evidence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  cents farmers cent lower prices higher futures corn agriculture tons grain wheat bushel market crop farm drought soybean agricultural production &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.77791170723425  \\n   Grain and &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; were mixed in volatile early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.

However, traders began to liquidate their positions for the weekend, and &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; were moving lower. Soybean &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; were steady to slightly &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; as soggy fields delay the planting of the &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; crop. But the potential for increased &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; acreage as &lt;b&gt; farmers &lt;/b&gt; switch from &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; is weighing on prices.

Reports that the Soviet Union had cut off oil shipments to the breakaway republic triggered speculation that the United States will back away from granting the Soviets most favored nation trade status. The designation would allow for freer trade between the superpowers. Forecasts for increasingly wet, warm weather in the Midwestern croplands prompted further selling this morning. Rain was expected in the region today and Friday, and the National Weather Service has predicted above-normal temperatures for the Midwest during the latter half of next week.

Grain &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; closed mixed to lower. Soybean &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; opened &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; on news that rain had eased dry conditions in the soybean-growing region of Brazil. Later in the morning, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimated the impending harvest would yield 19.4 million metric tons, significantly &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; than the U.S. Agriculture Department\\'s latest estimate of 18.5 million metric tons. ``This estimate was obviously negative for the U.S. market, and it took off any rallying attempt the beans might have had,\\'\\' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. Grain and &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; also retreated in reaction to generally &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; for other commodities, Spilka said. Losses in &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; were limited by expectations of new Soviet purchases, he said. At the close, &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; was 2 &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to 1 &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; with the contract for delivery in March at $3.18 a bushel; &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; was unchanged to { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; with March at $1.98{ a bushel; oats were { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to } &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; with March at $1.90} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; to 3\\\\ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; with March at $6.22 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt; 0.679714597098978  \\n   Futures &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; for grains and soybeans were mostly &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; at the close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. ``There was a pretty good rally in soy oil that gave soybeans a good boost,\\'\\' said Joel Karlin, analyst with Research Department Inc. ``India bought into the palm oil market. African countries have shown some interest in vegetable oils, too.\\'\\' Corn was supported by a rumor that the Soviet Union might be interested in as much as 1 million tons, he said. Export news sent &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; higher, said Susan Leighty, grains analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed rumors that China had bid for 300,000 &lt;b&gt; tons &lt;/b&gt; of the U.S. commodity, and rumors persisted that the Chinese would bid for 300,000 &lt;b&gt; tons &lt;/b&gt; more. The Soviet Union was also said to be in the &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; for 500,000 &lt;b&gt; tons &lt;/b&gt; of export bonus wheat, she said. Also firming &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; were weather reports calling for mild conditions in the next few days that might make the winter &lt;b&gt; crop &lt;/b&gt; more vulnerable to a cold snap later, Mrs. Leighty said. At the close, &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; was 1 &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; to 1{ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; higher, with the contract for March at $4.10} a bushel; &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; was \\\\ &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; higher, with March at $2.37} a bushel; oats were { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; to 2{ &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; lower, with March at $1.50}, and soybeans were 2 &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; to 6{ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; higher, with January at $5.67 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  mexico mexican taylor miss salinas cows pageant milk shark america mexico\\'s wynberg hormone carlos border positive burton bst castaneda rocky &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.476114516313481  \\n   It was ``an act of God\\'\\' that brought two love-struck bulls together with the &lt;b&gt; cows &lt;/b&gt; next door, says a man accused of negligence for failing to keep them apart. The bulls were unexpectedly freed from their pen when a tree limb felled by a storm crushed the fence enclosing them. They headed for Maggie and Blackbird, two pure-bred &lt;b&gt; cows &lt;/b&gt; awaiting artificial insemination by a $770,000, prize-winning Angus bull named Broadway. Since the bulls, aged 9 and 13 months, may have beaten Broadway\\'s time with the cows, the cows\\' owners were advised to wait 60 to 90 days before artificial insemination, to make sure Broadway was the father. Though this was done, the owners are suing Kirk Hardin, caretaker of the bulls and cows, for $39,000, accusing him of negligence in not keeping the guys and gals apart. Lonnie Pembrook, owner of Pembrook Cattle Co. near Fairview, and Tom Young, a New Jersey businessman, each owned a half-interest in Blackbird. Pembrook owns Maggie. Hardin, a specialist in artificial insemination and embryo transfer techniques, contends the fence mishap, in the fall of 1986, was an ``act of God\\'\\' that could not have been prevented or foreseen. The trial began Monday before a Payne County jury, and testimony ended Tuesday. Closing arguments are scheduled Friday. After the artificial insemination took place, the embryos were frozen, according to testimony. Pembrook picked up the frozen embryos in October, but there was no testimony on whether the embryos had since been placed in host cows. &lt;/p&gt; 0.394664977062178  \\n   Elizabeth Taylor ignored her ex-boyfriend in court Wednesday as their lawyers began selecting a jury to decide a multimillion-dollar dispute over the rights to her ``Passion\\'\\' perfume. Miss Taylor walked across the courtroom surrounded by her lawyers and made no acknowledgement of former beau Henry Wynberg, seated at the opposite end of a table. A panel of 50 prospective jurors sat with their eyes riveted on the actress, dressed in purple, as the judge explained what the trial was all about. Miss Taylor won permission earlier in the day to tell jurors about Wynberg\\'s criminal record after her lawyers said it would explain her decision to keep him out of her perfume business. Lawyers for Henry Wynberg sought to prevent jurors from hearing that Wynberg - who courted Miss Taylor between her two marriages to Richard Burton - once pleaded guilty to statutory rape, providing drugs to underage high school girls in return for sex and taking pornographic photos of young girls. They called the evidence ``irrelevant, inflammatory and prejudicial.\\'\\' But Miss Taylor\\'s lawyers argued that those issues were crucial to proving that she was justified in breaking off her business relationship with Wynberg ``because any reputable cosmetics company would refuse to deal with Wynberg.\\'\\' Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart declined to bar the evidence. Wynberg claims he conceived the actress\\' line of ``Passion\\'\\' perfume, and he\\'s seeking a hefty share of the profits. He says he created the fragrance under the Elizabeth Taylor Cosmetics Inc. banner. At stake: about $70 million a year in profits. Litigation has produced volumes of depositions and affidavits about Wynberg\\'s claim that he had a contract with Miss Taylor for exclusive rights to her name and likeness for promotion and sale of cosmetics. Wynberg sued in 1986 for 72 percent of ``Passion\\'\\' profits. Court documents show Wynberg\\'s two-year romance with the violet-eyed actress ended in August 1975, when Miss Taylor said, ``I\\'m going back to Richard, Henry. I\\'ll see you later.\\'\\' Burton and Miss Taylor remarried in Africa, and Wynberg returned to California. Court records show that a short time later, Miss Taylor and Wynberg signed the cosmetics agreement in Switzerland, with Burton as a witness. Wynberg said he spent years consulting with chemists and manufacturers, smelling perfumes and looking for the perfect bottle. ``I wanted sparkling little lights like stars in there, and I wanted it to look like money, feel like money,\\'\\' Wynberg said. According to Wynberg, Hen he presented the actress with the heart-shaped bottle and fragrance in November 1983, Miss Taylor said: ``Let\\'s let bygones be bygones, Henry. Let\\'s split 50-50 on the perfume deal.\\'\\' In a deposition, Miss Taylor denies Wynberg\\'s assertion. ``I didn\\'t want to do any business with him,\\'\\' she said. Miss Taylor contends that Wynberg\\'s failure to follow through on the project violated the contract and made it invalid. In 1986 she signed with the Chesebrough-Ponds Inc. cosmetics company to market ``Passion\\'\\' using her name and likeness. It went on to be a big seller. &lt;/p&gt; 0.346147855963656  \\n   A woman who dropped out of the 1988 Miss USA &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; after being charged with shoplifting pleaded guilty Wednesday. During her appearance in Hennepin County District Court, former Miss Minnesota-USA Sue Bolich, 24, of Mound admitted stealing several items from the Dayton\\'s store at the Southdale shopping mall. She was arrested Jan. 22. Police said she had taken $370 worth of items, including a swimsuit, silk scarves and hairpieces. In exchange for her guilty plea, she will be placed in a program while she receives counseling. ``It\\'s fair for a first-time alleged offender like Susie, and I think things will turn out fine for her,\\'\\' said Bolich\\'s attorney, Peter Timmons. Bolich\\'s successor to the Miss Minnesota-USA title also withdrew before the Miss USA pageant, after it was reported that she had pleaded guilty to shoplifting in 1986. &lt;/p&gt; 0.338342307362292  \\n   A teen-ager who required 110 stitches after a &lt;b&gt; shark &lt;/b&gt; attack in southeastern Australia said Friday that his surfing days are over. Murray Taylor, 15, said the ``huge shark\\'\\' dragged him from his surfboard and bit him repeatedly. Murray said he escaped by punching the &lt;b&gt; shark &lt;/b&gt; on the nose and trying to gouge its eyes. The attack occurred Thursday at Moana Beach, 30 miles south of Adelaide. ``When he reached the shore he actually walked up the beach on his own,\\'\\' said Murray\\'s mother, Wendy Richardson. ``Murray said he wasn\\'t sure how big the &lt;b&gt; shark &lt;/b&gt; was, but he said its head was at least a foot wide.\\'\\' The teen-ager was recuperating at Flinders Medical Center in Adelaide. &lt;/p&gt; 0.332970176259661  \\n   Three contestants in the Mrs. America &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; have complained about being given a survey to fill out on their love lives. According to Mrs. Alabama Diane Gamble, Mrs. Wisconsin Gale Coleman and Mrs. North Carolina Connie Hedrick, the survey included such questions as ``Can you be in love with two men at the same time?\\'\\' and ``Outside of the bedroom, where is the most unusual place you have had romance with your husband?\\'\\' Pageant president David Marmel said he had not seen the survey, adding that they were used in the past to find out types of products used by contestants for the product-marketing purposes of &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; sponsors. Marmel said the women were not obliged to answer the questions. The three contestants also complained Tuesday about the use of bikinis, saying the skimpy attire was degrading for a &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; featurng mothers and professional women. ``How is it going to look for my fellow workers to see me bumping and grinding in a bikini on national television? It\\'s demeaning, said Mrs. Gamble, a marketing director for an engineering firm. Only single-piece suits were used in state contests leading to the national pageant, she said. Jennifer Kline, 21, of Minnesota, won the &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; that ended Sunday and was televised Tuesday by ABC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  million year sales billion percent share total company quarter corp products industry earnings american operations reported largest estimated market profit &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.752168768863863  \\n   Hilton Hotels Corp. &lt;b&gt; reported &lt;/b&gt; its &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; rose 22 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in the third &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; partly because of improved results in its casino operations. Hilton said Wednesday it earned $27.2 million, or 57 cents a share, in the &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; ended Sept. 30, up from $22.3 million, or 44 cents a share, a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. Sales totaled $236.1 million, up 19 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; from $198.2 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; earlier. Gambling revenue nearly doubled, jumping to $33.1 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; from $18.5 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; in the 1987 third quarter. The gain was partly due to better results at Hilton\\'s Nevada casinos and to the company\\'s interest in the Conrad International hotel-casino in Queensland, Australia. Operating revenue in the hotel sector declined 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $21 million. The drop was largely due to a one-time credit that boosted revenue in the 1987 &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; and a charge for taxes that depressed the figure for the latest quarter, said Roy Judge, a vice president and assistant to the chairman. Hilton said hotel occupancy increased to 71 percent, from 70 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago, while Nevada gaming occupancy reached 90 percent, against 83 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in 1987. For the &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; to date, &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; rose 17 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $95.7 million, or $1.99 a share, from $81.5 million, or $1.62 a share. Revenue in the nine-month period totaled $699.2 million, up 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; from $623.4 million. &lt;/p&gt; 0.733807466553406  \\n   New European business and better &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; margins on North American &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; boosted Whirlpool Corp.\\'s fourth-quarter &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; nearly 21 percent, the appliance manufacturer said Tuesday. Whirlpool said earned $49.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $12 million, or 17 cents a share, in the fourth &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; of 1988. The year-earlier period included a $45 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; loss on the sale of Whirlpool\\'s kitchen cabinet business. The company\\'s 1989 fourth-quarter results include $9.2 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; in writedowns connection with Whirlpool\\'s plans to close its Mount Sterling, Ky., plant. Revenue totaled $1.57 billion, up from $1.02 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; in the fourth &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; of 1988, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said. For the year, Whirlpool said it earned $187.2 million, or $2.70 a share, on revenue of $6.29 billion, up from $94.1 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $4.42 billion, in in 1988. Whirlpool became the world\\'s &lt;b&gt; largest &lt;/b&gt; appliance concern with the January 1989 acquisition of a $470 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; stake in the appliance division of Dutch electronics giant NV Philips. In line with the agreement, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said 1989 results included all of the revenue of the joint venture, Whirlpool International BV, and 53 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of its net earnings. Whirlpool International\\'s performance and strong &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; in North America helped boost earnings, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said. However, these gains were offset by several factors, including higher interest expense and taxes, Whirlpool said. David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool chairman and chief executive officer, predicted flat &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; to come and said wage cuts accepted by Whirlpool workers in Evansville, Ind., would help keep costs competitive. Whitwam predicted appliance &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; would be down slightly in the first half of 1990, possibly rallying in the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt; 0.729792065674015  \\n   Avon Products Inc. said Wednesday its third &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; jumped 29 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; on slightly higher &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; of its beauty goods.

Earnings per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; came to 23.4 pence, or 38 cents, compared with 14.8 pence. Christies said its pre-tax &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; rose 57 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 66.9 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds, or $108 million, from 42.5 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds. Sales soared 71 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 1.33 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; pounds, or $2.1 billion, from 777 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds in 1988. Christies Chairman Lord Carrington said &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; in 1990 are ahead of a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. Growth in the breadth of interest in art, he said, allows the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; to ``look forward to the 1990s with optimism.\\'\\' Christies didn\\'t break out quarterly or six month results. It isn\\'t required to under British law. &lt;/p&gt; 0.683501740690939  \\n   General Motors Corp. and &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; analysts credit the automaker\\'s 29 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; increase in its second-quarter &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; to a return to profitability in its North American automaking business and continued strong results overseas. GM barely broke even building cars and trucks in North America in 1987, reaping $3.56 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; in 1987 &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; from accounting changes, tax benefits and record contributions from its streamlined overseas businesses and its subsidiaries. But second-quarter revenue for the nation\\'s biggest automaker rose 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $29.9 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $26.7 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago, breaking the previous quarterly record of $27.6 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; set in 1986 when the auto &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; set a 16.3 million-vehicle annual &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; record. GM &lt;b&gt; reported &lt;/b&gt; net &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; of $1.5 billion, or $4.52 a common share, up from $1.17 billion, or $3.39 a common share, in the second &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. ``It was a good quarter. The number of units produced per employee went up almost 17 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; versus second-quarter last year. That\\'s phenomenally good, showing the kind of &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; General Motors can have if &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; pick up,\\'\\' said Ronald Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco. Car and light truck &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; in 1988 have continued to surge well ahead of pessimistic predictions issued in the wake of the October 1987 stock &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; crisis. Expectations for the &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; have risen to a consensus of about 15.6 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; vehicles, and GM has benefited from the industry\\'s surprisingly strong performance. ``Last year, (sales) volume was so low that most of their gains came from accounting changes. This year, it seems based on volume. Sales were strong in the first half, particularly in the second quarter,\\'\\' said Kathleen Heaney, analyst with Nikko Securities International in New York. Second-quarter revenue rose 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; from a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago and broke the previous GM record for any &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; of $27.6 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; set in 1986, GM said. The &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; were the best for any &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; since second &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; 1984. GM also said that as of June 30, it had shaved $2.7 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; of the $4 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; it plans to trim from its costs during 1988. In the second quarter, operating income rose 64 percent, to $1.75 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $1.07 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; earlier. It rose 16 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in the first six months, to $2.4 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $2.08 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. GM said the improvement came both from a return to stronger profitability in North America and overseas performance stronger than last year\\'s record. However, GM said it does not provide income for different geographic areas on a quarterly basis. GM\\'s worldwide vehicle &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 9.3 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in the second quarter, to 2.25 million. At the end of the second quarter, GM\\'s North American-built cars and light trucks held 35.1 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the U.S. market, up slightly from 33.8 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; at the end of June 1987. In the first six months of 1988, GM &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; rose 13.3 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $2.6 billion, or $7.63 a share, on revenue of $56.34 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $2.29 billion, or $6.65 a share, on revenue of $52.8 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. On Wednesday, GM &lt;b&gt; reported &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; by its three subsidiaries _ General Motors Acceptance Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp., and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. GM blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings for an 18.9 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; drop in GMAC earnings. Second-quarter &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; for EDS and Hughes were up 33 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; and 16.4 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  health aids disease drug patients doctors treatment blood medical cancer research virus researchers study center fda immune university american system &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.673929140719054  \\n   The number of white &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cells infected by the AIDS &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; rises sharply in the year before virus-infected males actually develop the disease, says a &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; that may lead to speedier &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; for AIDS victims. While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is trying to develop a simpler test that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown AIDS, said the CDC\\'s Janet Nicholson. Such a test would help &lt;b&gt; doctors &lt;/b&gt; decide when the benefits of giving &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks, said Dr. Paul Volberding, associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and AIDS program director at San Francisco General Hospital. ``If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point, even if he hadn\\'t developed full-blown AIDS,\\'\\' he said. Nicholson, the CDC\\'s clinical immunology chief, presented her findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cells from 15 homosexual Atlanta men who were infected by the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didn\\'t suffer AIDS. Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, Nicholson said. She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected peripheral &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; mononuclear cells _ a class of white &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cells. If a simple test could show that someone infected with the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; soon will get AIDS, &lt;b&gt; doctors &lt;/b&gt; could better decide when to prescribe AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections that kill AIDS &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; once the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; has crippled their &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; systems, Volberding said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is believed to slow progression of AIDS. From a scientific standpoint, ``learning what a person\\'s risk of developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,\\'\\' he said. But Nicholson and Volberding acknowledged that some AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will develop &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; symptoms. Nicholson said &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; previously knew that people infected with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting white &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection progresses. Her &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; found that the number of helper cells decreases more quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in infected &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms. ``It\\'s not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will develop disease,\\'\\' she said, adding that her findings point the way toward determining which &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; are likely to do so. AIDS, or acquired &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; deficiency syndrome is caused by a &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; that damages the body\\'s &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. The CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991. &lt;/p&gt; 0.654384948653109  \\n   The Red Cross acknowledged Saturday it erred in distributing 24 pints of &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; that had failed AIDS procedures but said none of the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; was used and none carried the deadly virus. The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the questionable one-pint units were shipped last month to hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers in Washington and Nashville, Tenn., but were never used on any patients. The FDA did not identify the facilities that received the blood. ``While it should not have been shipped, it actually proved to be HIV (AIDS virus) free, and a number of units underwent processing that would inactivate the virus,\\'\\' said Gene Jeffers, American Red Cross spokesman. He said there was ``no known &lt;b&gt; health &lt;/b&gt; hazard associated with the 24 units of blood. We were very fortunate and lucked out in that there was no human risk at all involved here.\\'\\' Jeffers acknowledged, however, that five of the units tested positive for hepatitis B antigens and could have posed a &lt;b&gt; health &lt;/b&gt; risk had they been used in transfusions. However, they were not used, he said. Initial tests showed 10 of the questionable units contained HIV antibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those units underwent a process that breaks down the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; into components for specific uses and eliminates the virus, Jeffers said. The remaining nine units, he said, were from donors who were unacceptable because they previously tested ``false positive\\'\\' for AIDS, but all the actual units were tested as safe, he said. Federal officials estimate that the chances of getting AIDS, or acquired &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; deficiency syndrome, from a transfusion are one in 40,000. The chief victims have been homosexual men or intravenous &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; users. No one is known to have recovered from the &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; that attacks the body\\'s &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The Nashville Banner reported Saturday that two additional pints from disqualified donors were actually used in transfusions, but no patient was harmed. The newspaper gave no details of the transfusions but said follow-up tests of the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; donors showed they did not carry the AIDS virus. Jeffers said he knew of no actual transfusion of &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; that should have been rejected. The FDA report said none of the questionable &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; was used on patients. As a result of the errors, the FDA said it has increased its periodic audits of the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; supply and instituted new training procedures for &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; bank employees. The mistake in Washington was discovered in a routine audit. The Tennessee errors came to light in an FDA investigation that followed a lawsuit against local &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; bank officials by a woman who said she became infected with AIDS through a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; transfusion. Two senior officials of the Washington regional office of the American Red Cross _ John McGraw and Frederick Darr _ have been suspended with pay for 30 days pending an investigation of their actions, said Richard Schubert, president of the American Red Cross. Schubert said no officials in the Nashville &lt;b&gt; center &lt;/b&gt; had been disciplined, but that the investigation there was continuing. Six of the questionable units of &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; were from the Washington &lt;b&gt; center &lt;/b&gt; and the other 18 were from Nashville, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.644204546928449  \\n   The Centers for Disease Control disputes a &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; by the Hudson Institute that the number of Americans infected with the deadly AIDS &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; is actually twice the official estimate. In a &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; released Friday, the Hudson Institute said that up to 3 million Americans are infected by the AIDS virus, an estimate that is far above the calculation by CDC, the primary federal agency monitoring the spread of AIDS. Kevin R. Hopkins, a Hudson mathematician, said his &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; uses ``realistic\\'\\' assumptions not used by the CDC and, as a result, his estimate is closer to the true number of Americans infected by the human immunodeficiency &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; which causes AIDS. ``The actual number of people carrying the HIV &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; in the United States (at the end of 1987) was not the 900,000 to 1.4 million the official sources estimate, but probably more than twice that number,\\'\\' the Hudson report said. ``There were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the AIDS virus, with the most likely total of infections probably close to 2.4 million,\\'\\' the report said. Dr. Timothy Dondero, chief of a CDC branch studying the spread of AIDS, quickly disputed the claim, however. In a telephone interview from the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Dondero said he and his staff reviewed the Hudson &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; and the methods used and said, ``We do not feel a change in our data is appropriate.\\'\\' He said that for the Hudson model to be correct, about 2 percent of the young adult population in the United States would have to be infected with HIV. Yet, he said, ``their figures are inconsistently high within segments of populations for which there are test results.\\'\\' Dondero said tests from hospital patients, military recruits and prisoners show HIV infection rates of less than 1 percent _ 0.2 percent to 0.66 percent _ among young adults. Hopkins admitted, ``We\\'re all in a guessing game\\'\\' when it comes to estimating the number of people infected with the AIDS virus. Nonetheless, he said he believed the Hudson method is a more realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation. ``The CDC may be right and we may be wrong,\\'\\' Hopkins said. ``Until a national seroprevalence test is conducted, we will not know. ... The main conclusion is that we cannot be complacent about this disease.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; by Hudson, a privately financed public policy &lt;b&gt; research &lt;/b&gt; organization with headquarters in Indianapolis, used basic CDC data on the number of AIDS cases. But Hopkins said Hudson used different computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques to estimate the rate of HIV infections. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is caused by the HIV virus, is the end stage of the &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; and may not develop for years after a person is infected with the virus. But an infected person can spread the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; before developing AIDS. For this reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic. HIV infection is determined by a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; test which identifies antibodies in &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; serum. A person with such antibodies is known as seropositive. Hopkins said the Hudson &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; also estimated that the number of heterosexuals infected by the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; may be three times higher than CDC estimates. The CDC says the chief victims of AIDS, a contagious &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; that attacks the body\\'s &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system, have been homosexual men and intravenous &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; users. The Hudson &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; estimates that of the 850,000 to 1.4 million heterosexuals infected with the HIV virus, between 200,000 and 500,000 are those who do not use drugs. ``There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,\\'\\' said Hopkins. ``A breakout into the non-monogamous population is unavoidable.\\'\\' The CDC has estimated that the AIDS &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; has infected only 80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population. The Hudson report said about 118,000 of the heterosexuals infected are ``mainstream\\'\\' population members. ``They are not poor, and they are not IV &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; users,\\'\\' Hudson said. ``But they are nonetheless carriers of the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; and, through their sexual contacts, can proceed to spread the &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; to others of their same class.\\'\\' The CDC says that as of Aug. 15, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,702 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,898, have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. &lt;/p&gt; 0.621781836027599  \\n   Mice prone to developing a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; gained partial protection from a human gene that influences &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell development, suggesting that developmental genes may affect vulnerability to cancer, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; say. Such genes may make a difference in how long normal cells remain susceptible to turning malignant, they said. The work is reported in Thursday\\'s issue of the British journal Nature by Philip Leder, Michel Nussenzweig and Emmett Schmidt of Harvard Medical School with colleagues there and at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. They worked with mice that carried a human c-myc gene, which puts them at high risk for developing a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; called pre-B cell lymphoma. Pre-B cells are those that will develop as B cells, an important part of the body\\'s disease-fighting &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system. Those mice were bred with others that carried a different human gene, one that makes B cells skip an early stage in their development. Some progeny from these matings inherited both human genes, and their lymphoma rates were compared to those that carried only the cancer-causing gene. Results showed that the gene that speeds development caused both a delay and a reduction in the tumors, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; said. By 117 days of age, half the mice that carried only the cancer-causing gene had developed lymphoma, but none of the mice with both genes had developed it. After a year, more than 90 percent of the first group had developed tumors, compared to only 40 percent of the mice with both human genes. The developmental gene apparently hampered development of &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; by speeding up the maturation of pre-B cells, leaving fewer at stages most susceptible to the cancer-causing gene, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; suggested. In general, a diverse group of genes that produce either an acceleration or pause in cell development may influence the rates and time of onset for cancer, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.615171713382808  \\n   A panel of experts says removing a cancerous tumor in the early stages of breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; gives as good a survival chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast is removed. Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give ``excellent\\'\\' results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the panel said. The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the National Institutes of Health to consider &lt;b&gt; research &lt;/b&gt; on the survival of women with early stages of breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; and to develop a consensus on what therapy should be used to treat the disease. ``The therapies appear to be equivalent in survival,\\'\\' said Dr. William C. Wood, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and chairman of the committee. ``We believe it is preferable to preserve an organ.\\'\\' Mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early stage breast cancer, Wood said. A lumpectomy is followed with radiation therapy, and Wood said some &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; choose mastectomy because they ``prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of radiation therapy.\\'\\' In its report, the committee said surgery in which the breast is saved, or conserved, ``is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer, and is preferable\\'\\' because the breast is preserved and the survival chances are the same as for mastectomy. Wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the removal of nearby lymph nodes. If these nodes are cancer-free and the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter, both methods of &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; have about a 90 percent chance of cure. About 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; this year, the committee report said. Between 75 percent and 80 percent of this group will have Stage I or Stage II disease, and about two-thirds of these will have cancer-free lymph nodes. Stage I and II cancers have not spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes. But just how to treat this early-stage breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; long has been controversial. Traditionally, the preferred &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; has been a radical mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is removed. During the past two decades, there have been a number of studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast surgery, including lumpectomy. The committee found that, based on the studies, survival rates are virtually the same for the two types of therapy. The experts said the picture was less clear for follow-up &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; using chemotherapy or a &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; that blocks the hormone estrogen. The studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy, but the committee said the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patient\\'s quality of life. For &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; with very small primary tumors _ one centimeter or less _ adjuvant therapy is not required, the committee said. The committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full understanding by the patient of all the options. Lumpectomies are not appropriate for all Stage I or II &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; because of the size of the breast, or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps within the breast, the committee said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  black city mayor white barry community blacks council memorial city\\'s moore racial jackson whites koch rights robinson civil members rev &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.374482495957865  \\n   Marion Barry\\'s lawyer is portraying Rasheeda Moore as a vengeful ex-lover who trapped the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; in an FBI sting operation because he had abandoned her for another woman. Moore, a former model, denied the suggestion Friday at the mayor\\'s cocaine and perjury trial, insisting, ``I was not out to get Mr. Barry.\\'\\' But she acknowledged that she had repeatedly steered the conversation around to drugs during the secretly videotaped encounter with Barry in a Washington hotel room last Jan. 18. She conceded that Barry was primarily interested that evening in having sex with her. In her second day of cross-examination by Barry\\'s chief lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, Moore also acknowledged that she broke the FBI\\'s instructions and tried to persuade the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; to use drugs. Midway through the FBI videotape in which Barry ultimately smoked crack cocaine, Moore asked the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; if he wants to use drugs. ``No, not tonight,\\'\\' Barry replied in the tape, which was played in court Thursday. ``You felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade, influence, coerce or beguile\\'\\' Barry into using drugs, Mundy asked Moore. ``I did,\\'\\' she replied. ``Why did you do that?\\'\\' the lawyer asked. ``Just in the gist of the evening,\\'\\' said Moore, who said she got ``overcarried\\'\\' in performing her duties for the FBI. ``In your zeal to get Mr. Barry,\\'\\' Mundy said accusingly. ``For all you knew, he had been off drugs since May\\'\\' 1989 when Moore moved to California. ``Not in my zeal,\\'\\' the witness insisted. ``I was not out to get Mr. Barry.\\'\\' ``What was your intent?\\'\\' Mundy asked Moore. ``Working this operation\\'\\' with the FBI, she replied. The defense lawyer suggested that Moore had been badly treated by the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; and motivated by revenge. ``Were you mad at Mr. Barry because he didn\\'t return your calls\\'\\' throughout an eight-month span in 1989, Mundy asked. ``No, I wasn\\'t,\\'\\' Moore replied. She also denied that she was angry because the married &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; was involved with another woman, Maria McCarthy, or because he had slapped her when they broke up their romantic relationship. Had Moore been scorned? a reporter asked Mundy after the day\\'s court session. ``A woman scorned,\\'\\' Mundy agreed immediately. ``Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\\'\\' McCarthy was jailed for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury looking into the mayor\\'s alleged drug use. She later relented and is now listed as a possible witness at Barry\\'s trial. Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. One of the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation. Meanwhile Friday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, presiding in the Barry case, barred &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; activist clergyman George Augustus Stallings, a Barry supporter, from attending the trial. Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest, broke with the Vatican by starting his own African-American church. Mundy and the American Civil Liberties Union said they were asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn Jackson\\'s decision regarding Stallings as well as his order Thursday barring Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Jackson said Stallings\\' and Farrakhan\\'s presence in the courtroom would be potentially disruptive. Barry told reporters he could ``not understand why any citizen\\'\\' who wanted to use one of the four courtroom passes provided to the defense cannot do so. ``So I think that we are in a totalitarian situation where Bishop Stallings or Minister Farrakhan (cannot attend.),\\'\\' Barry said. ``It\\'s like in Nazi Germany.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.364913244447588  \\n   Beneath a naked bluff on a mile-long Boston Harbor island known chiefly for its antiquated jail lie the unmarked graves of about 4,100 early immigrants whose American dreams ended in death. Most were famine-weakened Irish who fled their starving country in the mid-1800s only to be deemed ``undesirable\\'\\' and detained on Deer Island, where they died and until now were largely forgotten. ``They symbolize all immigrants that have come to Boston and to America,\\'\\' Mayor Raymond Flynn said this week. ``They may have been poor, probably didn\\'t have any family and weren\\'t among the elite. ``But still every respect should be afforded to their memory.\\'\\' Residents of Boston, home to more Irish-Americans per capita than any other U.S. city, are resurrecting the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; missing chapter. Deer Island\\'s low-security jail is scheduled to close in 1991 and local business, labor and other groups plan to have the gravesite landscaped by 1995, the 150th anniversary year of the potato famine. The &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; has announced plans to erect a Celtic cross on the island and a statue near Fanueil Hall as part of the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; ``Great Hunger Memorial Project,\\'\\' the nation\\'s first &lt;b&gt; memorial &lt;/b&gt; to Irish famine victims _ and victims of hunger around the world. The graves on the island about four miles from Boston\\'s wharves came to Flynn\\'s attention several months ago, after construction workers turned up bones at a new sewage treatment plant site. ``You think of them getting this far, coming across the Atlantic and being able to look over and see the &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; ... only to end up in an anonymous pauper\\'s grave,\\'\\' said Francis J. Costello, the mayor\\'s adviser on Irish-American Affairs. ``We have to put a proper finish on this.\\'\\' Many of the thousands of immigrants held on Deer Island eventually made it to a new life on the mainland. But thousands more were buried in shallow, lime-lined trenches that held eight or 10 bodies each. Their anonymous graves tell the story of immigrants who saw but never reached America\\'s shores. Ireland\\'s population of 8 million was cut in half by fatal disease, starvation and emigration after a devastating plant disease hit the country\\'s staple potato crop in 1845. During the next 10 years, more than 152,000 Irish fled to Boston, many of them tenant farmers forced to move on when they no longer could afford to pay rent. The Yankees were unprepared for the influx of penniless, weak and diseased immigrants, many of whom were near death after a month or more aboard the crowded ``coffin ships\\'\\' they had taken across the Atlantic. ``As a precautionary measure to ward off a pestilence that would have been ruinous to the public health and business of the city,\\'\\' a quarantine hospital was established on Deer Island, according to a Massachusetts Senate document dated 1848. Paupers and inmates also were held on the island because officials deemed them, like the Irish and a fraction of immigrants from other countries, ``undesirable within the core urban area,\\'\\' according to &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; documents. ``It was really a human dump heap,\\'\\' said Dennis P. Ryan, author of ``Beyond The Ballot: A Social History of the Boston Irish.\\'\\' Several rough-hewn wooden crosses stood for years on the bluff near the graves, but by about 1970 they had disappeared or disintegrated. A lone &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; Celtic cross also was erected amid the yellow rapeseed, but that too is gone. ``It wasn\\'t a deep dark secret,\\'\\' said Deborah Cox, president of the Public Archaeology Laboratory Inc. in Pawtucket, R.I. ``I think it was just one of those things people don\\'t pay attention to and then eventually forget,\\'\\' said Cox, whose company surveyed Deer Island before construction began on the new sewage treatment plant in late 1988. Boston\\'s archivist, Edward Quill, has begun researching death records and handwritten weekly logs kept by physicians at Deer Island\\'s quarantine hospital. For years the records have gathered dust, now they\\'ll be available to genealogists and other researchers. Several Flynns have turned up among the 872 names Quill has traced. ``It could well have been any immigrant group that has come to our country,\\'\\' said Mayor Flynn. ``That\\'s why we need a symbol, a decent resting place ... so their history won\\'t be forgotten.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.352500052649356  \\n   The cocaine and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry has focused attention on race relations in the nation\\'s capital, a &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; with a 70 percent &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; population and little recent history of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; strife. ``I think that there is a perception with a substantial number of the population that he is being picked on unfairly,\\'\\' said Kenneth Robinson, a local attorney who consulted with Barry\\'s counsel. Robinson is white. ``I think the Barry trial is just another indication that people are very, very sensitive to race and how people are treated,\\'\\' said Ethelbert Miller, a poet who teaches at Howard University. Miller is black. A U.S. District Court jury began deliberating the Barry case Thursday afternoon. Two members, both men, are white. One of them has been chosen jury foreman. Barry admits that the trial has brought to the surface ``a simmering amount of polarization and racism that was already there.\\'\\' Some &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; agree with Barry\\'s claim that he was the target of overzealous &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; prosecutors. Others feel betrayed by the mayor, who had claimed repeatedly that he didn\\'t use drugs. ``The majority of &lt;b&gt; whites &lt;/b&gt; are just plain annoyed and angry and just want this guy to go,\\'\\' D.C. Councilman Jim Nathanson said before the trial began. Nathanson, who is white, represents a predominantly &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; district. For all the talk about &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; polarization, Barry is the one who was often credited with cooling the tempers that erupted after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Ten people died, 1,191 were reported injured and 7,650 were arrested in the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; worst riots. Washington was then 63 percent black. Some &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; leaders, Jesse L. Jackson among them, have suggested that the climate exists for a resurgence of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; violence in Washington if Barry is convicted. Barry himself said it will not. ``Those who would even talk about that don\\'t represent me, don\\'t represent what I stand for,\\'\\' he told reporters last week. ``You obviously don\\'t realize that we have grown as a people the last 20 years. We will not destroy that which we have worked so hard to build up.\\'\\' ``To equate this to the violence that would occur when a &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; man killed Martin Luther King is asinine,\\'\\' Robinson said. ``People will talk about it in bars and on the street, but I just don\\'t believe that it is going to happen.\\'\\' ``Some of the noise that you hear is sort of par for the course,\\'\\' said Sam Smith, the &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; publisher of the Progressive Review, a Washington opinion journal. ``It\\'s just that more people are paying attention to it now.\\'\\' The presiding judge in the trial, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is white. One of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin, is white. The other, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts, is black. Barry\\'s lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, is black. Barry has called the case ``a political lynching\\'\\' and a case of ``satanic, dirt-like tactics.\\'\\' Jackson called it part of an ``ugly pattern\\'\\' of ``white judicial leadership attacking &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; political leadership.\\'\\' NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks voiced a similar complaint. U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said he believes in trying cases ``regardless of who the person is or what the political priorities are.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; and his allies have also sharply criticized news media coverage of the case. Abdul Alim Muhammad, a Muslim who is running for Congress in suburban Prince George\\'s County, Md., said, ``What we are witnessing in D.C. is like an electronic lynching. In some respects, the media are no better than the red-necked tobacco chewing &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of the Ku Klux Klan.\\'\\' Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, has shown his support for Barry by attending the trial despite efforts by the judge to have him barred as ``potentially disruptive.\\'\\' Barry, who broke into politics as a street organizer in the &lt;b&gt; civil &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; movement, has been &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; for 12 years. He is not seeking re-election, and six candidates are running to succeed him. When one of them, City Council Chairman David Clarke, was introduced at a rally for &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; South African leader Nelson Mandela, he was booed by &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of the mostly &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; audience. Clarke is white. Although he still has a loyal following, especially among poor blacks, Barry is increasingly viewed as an embarrassment by &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of Washington\\'s large &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; middle class. Long-time &lt;b&gt; civil &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; advocate and educator Roger Wilkins, a past political supporter of the mayor, wrote recently in The Washington Post: ``Marion Barry used the elders and lied to the young. He has manipulated thousands of others with his cynical use of charges of racism to defend his malodorous personal failures.\\'\\' Robert Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, said Barry ``has certainly created a &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; situation out of something that I do not think was. He is exploiting tensions and in some cases creating tensions that otherwise would not have existed.\\'\\' Woodson, who is black, was a member of a White House &lt;b&gt; council &lt;/b&gt; on private sector initiatives in the Reagan administration. The Rev. James Bevel, a Barry supporter who conducted prayer meetings in a tent outside the courthouse through much of the trial, said; ``It is not affecting basic race relationships or hostilities in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; folks toward &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; people. I don\\'t see that in the people I\\'m around.\\'\\' The Rev. A. Knighton Stanley, the &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; pastor of People\\'s Congregational Church, said he avoids raising the issue of possible violence. ``Am I uneasy? My answer is yes,\\'\\' said Stanley. ``My judgment is we will not have it, and my prayer is that my judgment is right.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.325951367562285  \\n   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he stands by his criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson before New York\\'s Democratic primary, but says he regrets that his belligerent style and sharply worded attacks offended Jackson\\'s supporters. In a statement released hours after Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called on the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; to apologize for his ``divisive\\'\\' remarks, Koch said he had ``articulated my concerns in a way that, regrettably, offended a large number of people, both &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; and white.\\'\\' ``I would hope they will look beyond my style to the substance of what I said, which I believe was fair political criticism. ``The words I used were too sharp. These are words I have used for years. Because of the particular sensitivity of this situation, I should have been more careful in my choice of words.\\'\\' It was highly unusual for Ward _ the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; first &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; police commissioner and a Koch appointee _ to comment on political matters that did not directly involve the police department, but he said he felt the need to do so because he was being asked regularly about Koch\\'s anti-Jackson efforts. In a letter that appeared in today\\'s editions of The New York Times, Koch said, ``It was never my intent to draw political lines with &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; or religious borders.\\'\\' Ward said today he was ``absolutely\\'\\' satisfied that the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; never intended to insult the &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; community. Koch\\'s attacks on Jackson have brought a continued backlash and have prompted early efforts to form a coalition to defeat the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; next year, when it is expected he will seek a fourth term. When asked if Koch was apologizing to Jackson as well as his supporters, the mayor\\'s press secretary, George Arzt, responded: ``Whatever the letter says. We\\'re not going beyond it.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.319054610538338  \\n   Big Bird was there, and Fozzie Bear, and Oscar the Grouch, as more than 1,400 colleagues, family and fans paid tribute to Muppet creator Jim Henson in a verdant St. Paul\\'s Cathedral. England was a second home to Henson, who died in May at the age of 53. ``He loved England and the English; we claim him as ours,\\'\\' said Duncan Kenworthy, chief of Henson Productions in Britain. For the tribute, the cathedral was transformed to resemble a north London parkland Henson loved. The 17th-century building was festooned with greenery, its aisles full of Henson\\'s creatures and portraits of their creator. Friends and colleagues of Henson had worked into the night adorning the cathedral with garlands, plants and birches. A May 21 &lt;b&gt; memorial &lt;/b&gt; for Henson at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York included a Dixieland band and Muppets singing their way through the crowd. Henson died May 16 in New York of pneumonia. Henson\\'s family asked well-wishers not to wear black, saying the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for Henson\\'s life as a traditional &lt;b&gt; memorial &lt;/b&gt; service. ``He has left a heritage that will never be forgotten. Jim Henson will always be with us,\\'\\' said Lord Lew Grade. It was Grade who contracted Henson in 1976 to make 24 half-hour episodes of ``The Muppet Show\\'\\' after the Muppeteer failed to find American backing for the variety show. The show became one of the most widely seen television programs in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100 countries. Most of Henson\\'s films were made in Britain as well. Henson owned a home in north London\\'s leafy Hampstead district, across the street from the onetime Victorian post office housing the Creature Shop where his puppets are made. Muppet performer Richard Hunt led a quartet in a medley of Henson\\'s favorite songs. Henson\\'s wife Jane and four of his five children attended. ```When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who makes a difference in this world,\\'\\'\\' daughter Cheryl, 29, recited from an essay written by her father. ```My hope still is to leave this world a little bit better than it was when I got here.\\'\\'\\' ``We really feel he did leave the world a bit better,\\'\\' she told the congregation. ``So, thanks.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  attorney meese general justice reed sources edwin investigation thornburgh board wallach criminal wedtech meese\\'s pipeline warmus peres iii independent chinn &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.502293898442515  \\n   After 10 months, one of the many unanswered questions in the &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Attorney General Edwin Meese III is whether he benefited financially from his efforts on behalf of an Iraqi oil &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; project or scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; familiar with the probe say. Last May 11, &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel James McKay launched his inquiry of Meese\\'s assistance to Wedtech and the probe has spread to the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s involvement with the pipeline. In both instances, McKay\\'s investigators have been examining stock trades made on Meese\\'s behalf by his investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn. Chinn and Meese were brought together by Meese\\'s longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, a central figure in both the Wedtech scandal and the &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; project. It was disclosed earlier this month that: _In connection with the $1 billion proposed pipeline, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport paid $150,000 to his &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; Wallach, who directed the funds to an account owned by Chinn. Rappaport was a partner in the project with San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc., which was going to build the pipeline. Rappaport was brought into the deal in 1985 primarily because of his close ties to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. _The money from the Meese Partners account, Wallach\\'s $150,000 placed in the Chinn account and several hundred thousand dollars from Chinn\\'s biggest customer, Marymount College of Palos Verdes, Calif., were used as capital by Chinn to buy hard-to-get, brand-new stock issues, which Chinn sold later the same day. It would have been difficult for Chinn to obtain such stock with Meese\\'s money alone. ``Without using the holdings of the other accounts he controlled, ... Mr. Chinn may not have been able to conduct the number of trades he did ... on behalf of Meese Partners,\\'\\' a congressional subcommittee said in a report this month. _Once the stock was sold and the profit and loss determined, Chinn assigned profits and losses to his various customers. Overall, Meese invested $50,000 and came away 18 months later with $95,000, almost all of it gained through a total of 23 one-day stock trades. Eighteen of the trades were profitable. In seven of the trades, the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; didn\\'t have enough money in his account to generate the profits and losses that were assigned him. Chinn\\'s biggest customer, Marymount College, didn\\'t fare nearly as well as Meese. Was the stock trading actually a well-disguised payoff to Meese? That question is one that McKay\\'s office has been unable to resolve, say the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Central to the &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; is whether there was a plan to steer the proceeds of Chinn\\'s stock transactions to Meese and whether the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; knew about it. The &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; says he knew nothing about the transactions because he had set up a limited blind partnership with Chinn\\'s company under which details were to be kept secret from Meese as a way to protect the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; from violating rules against conflict of interest. The investigators face a wall of silence from the others involved in setting up the financial arrangements, Chinn and Wallach, who are both under indictment for racketeering in the Wedtech scandal. Wallach denied to McKay\\'s investigators that he gave anything of value to Meese, but Wallach refused to tell McKay anything about his dealings with Wedtech, his knowledge of the Meese-Chinn partnership and his dealings with Chinn. McKay said that after the Wedtech trial expected later this year of Wallach, Chinn and business associate R. Kent London, the &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel may seek their testimony again. The &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s good fortune in stock trading began months after he smoothed the way for Wallach to discuss the &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; with then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who met with Wallach and Rappaport in June 1985. Later in the year, Meese and Wallach met with Peres about the pipeline, which was never built. Also during the period the stock trading was taking place, Chinn sat on the &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors of Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor that allegedly paid out millions of dollars to lawyers and lobbyists in an attempt to influence various public officials, including Meese, in the awarding of federal contracts. One of those lawyers was Wallach, who was paid $1.3 million from 1981 through 1986 by Wedtech. The stock trades that made profits for the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; took place some four years after Meese, then White House counselor, arranged for his deputy, James Jenkins, to intervene on behalf of Wedtech in connection with a $32 million no-bid contract to build small engines for the Army. Despite the misgivings of Army officials over what they regarded as a high price, Wedtech was awarded the contract following a White House meeting called by Jenkins. Meese ended the financial arrangement with Chinn last year after the investment adviser came under &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; in the Wedtech scandal and after public disclosure that Chinn had sat on Wedtech\\'s &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors. &lt;/p&gt; 0.444618248789634  \\n   Attorney General Edwin Meese\\'s wife, Ursula, will undergo questioning shortly in the &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of her husband about her own $40,000-a-year job, say &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; familiar with the case. The office of &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel James McKay is trying to determine whether longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach in effect helped supplement the Meeses\\' income by recommending Mrs. Meese for jobs, said &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; familiar with the probe, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mrs. Meese has retained the same Washington law firm representing her husband, said James Rocap, one of Meese\\'s lawyers. She will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be questioned by investigators from McKay\\'s office. McKay said last week that his &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese, also encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Meese\\'s job, would continue at least until the end of April. McKay last month subpoenaed records relating to Mrs. Meese\\'s post with the Washington chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, said a lawyer for the chapter, James Bierbower. A lawyer for Wallach, George Walker, has told The Washington Post that Wallach had suggested Mrs. Meese for a job with a local radio station owned by the Bender family of Washington. Mrs. Meese took the position with the MS Society instead. However, Bierbower said the Bender Foundation of Washington, controlled by the same family that owns the radio station, is contributing the $40,000 a year that constitutes Mrs. Meese\\'s salary with the MS group. Calls to the Bender Foundation seeking its reasons for paying Mrs. Meese\\'s salary were not returned. Mrs. Meese has been a volunteer for the MS Society since 1981 and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called Operation Job Match, matching MS victims with employers. Mrs. Meese also was questioned in an earlier &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel\\'s &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese in 1984. In that investigation, &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel Jacob Stein probed Meese\\'s failure to include in his financial disclosure statements a $15,000 loan by Edwin Thomas to Mrs. Meese. Thomas later became Meese\\'s assistant counselor at the White House. The &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel found no connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by Thomas, his wife and his son. In another development Monday, Justice Department &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; said Meese will face an ethics &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; by his own department\\'s Office of Professional Responsibility if McKay doesn\\'t seek an indictment. Such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a recommendation to President Reagan that Meese be fired. Former Assistant Attorney General William Weld\\'s files on the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s dealings with Wallach were moved to OPR last Friday, the &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; said. Material collected by Weld\\'s &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; division last year led to McKay\\'s &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese. McKay said Friday he has insufficient evidence to date to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his involvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; touted by Wallach or his involvement with the regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he held $14,000 in Baby Bell stock. In December, McKay said he didn\\'t have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. McKay said that if he decides not to seek a &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; indictment of Meese, the &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel\\'s office ``will refer all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate administrative authorities,\\'\\' a reference to OPR. OPR\\'s chief, Michael Shaheen, denied assertions by Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, that his office had begun examining Meese\\'s ties to longtime friend Wallach last year. That review was halted when McKay launched his &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese last May 11, the &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.380476725806409  \\n   A top aide to Attorney General Edwin Meese III says a recent congressional report accusing his boss of violating White House ethics rules should top a ``list of sleaze.\\'\\' Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who last year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to Meese, said the bipartisan Senate report is harmful to ongoing inquiries into the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s actions. ``We\\'ve got a process that\\'s in place, people who are investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are,\\'\\' Reynolds said on CBS-TV\\'s ``Face the Nation\\'\\' program. ``If that is the best case that one comes up with against this &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; for ethical conduct, I would have to say that this man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect.\\'\\' Reynolds, the top enforcer of the Reagan administration\\'s civil rights policies, added: ``If I were making a list of sleaze, I\\'d put that (the report) at the top.\\'\\' The report, issued Wednesday by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management, concluded that Meese\\'s violation of the rules resulted in ``improper favoritism\\'\\' for the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. The report said E. Robert Wallach sent Meese, then counselor to President Reagan, 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing Wedtech\\'s efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the Army and government officials\\' opposition to those efforts. Meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of Wedtech, but says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair hearing. Wallach, a longtime friend of Meese, is now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal. He was paid $1.3 million by the Bronx, N.Y.-company, which subsequently won the no-bid, $32 million contract. ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House policy on contracts with procurement officials, which failure resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,\\'\\' the report said. The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981 says that ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or business associate has a financial interest.\\'\\' Reynolds said the report ``made reference to a policy or rule in the White House that wasn\\'t in existence at the time the Wedtech thing was referred over to the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general.\\'\\' Independent Counsel James McKay has been investigating Meese\\'s ties to Wedtech, a $1 billion Iraqi &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; project promoted by Wallach, and other matters. In addition, the Office of Government Ethics is conducting an inquiry into why Meese solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessman to pay more than $3,000 apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference. Reynolds maintained that despite the investigations, morale at the Justice Department remains good. ``Actually, it\\'s very good,\\'\\' he said. ``We have a lot of professionals. Everybody in the department is very professional. ``Most of the people in the department take the attitude that is much the same as George Bush\\'s attitude. These are investigations that are ongoing.

Aug. 8, 1984: Congress approves a Reagan administration plan to move some Justice Department workers from the Chester Arthur Building and to give up 37 percent of its space when the lease expires in March 1986. March 1, 1985: Howard Bender, a Washington real estate developer, heads a partnership which completes purchase of the Chester Arthur Building for $37.5 million, nearly twice the assessed value and three times its purchase price about five years earlier. June 6, 1985: The administration notifies Congress the Justice Department intends to stay in the Chester Arthur Building, instead of moving out some employees. June 1985: Officials of the Justice Department\\'s Immigration and Naturalization Service, the major tenant in the building, forward complaints to the General Services Administration _ the government\\'s housekeeper _ that the building\\'s air system is causing illness among workers. Fall 1985: Officials at WWDC, a rock-and-roll radio station owned by the Bender family, offer Attorney General Edwin Meese\\'s wife, Ursula, a position as a public affairs commentator. She declines the offer. Sept. 26, 1985: Assistant immigration commissioner James Kennedy formally requests an environmental inspection of the air system at Chester Arthur. October 1985: The Bender Foundation, a family-owned philanthropy, makes known that it is willing to donate money to pay Ursula Meese as a development director of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, where she has been a volunteer. Howard Bender\\'s wife, Sondra, is president of the foundation and serves on the MS society board. Jan. 1, 1986: Mrs. Meese begins a $40,000-a-year job, under the Bender Foundation\\'s three-year grant. July 2, 1986: Environmental inspectors report ``many offices in the Chester Arthur Building which exhibited high complaint rates and above-average sick leave occurences contained viable aero-allergens in concentrations which could easily produce these effects.\\'\\' May 14, 1987: The GSA signs a $50 million, 10-year lease for Justice Department workers to stay in the Chester Arthur Building after the Bender partnership promises to clean the air system. The rent jumps more than three-fold. May 27, 1987: The partnership headed by Howard Bender sells the Chester Arthur Building for $60.1 million cash _ a $22.7 million profit over two years _ to an Illinois-based partnership. &lt;/p&gt; 0.366105433666985  \\n   July 8 The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on the resignation of Attorney General Meese: The last crony is leaving. Months, even years after propriety demanded it, Ed Meese says he\\'ll resign _ sometime. Whatever conservative legacy he left the Justice Department and the courts is overshadowed by his cheapening of the office of &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; and the chaos now paralyzing Justice. ... Meese has managed to slip through the net in four investigations, because the evidence against him always was circumstantial. It just happened that cronies who did favors for Meese soon ended up with lucrative government contracts, or federal jobs or other special favors. The best Meese\\'s investigators could find was impropriety, not illegality. Yet the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; took the lack of charges as a ringing endorsement of his innocence. ... Meese is a deal-maker, a hustler. He never understood that the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; can\\'t use his office to create a personal pork barrel. ... Does Meese leave any legacy except sleaze? ... He tried to weaken the Miranda Rule and abortion rights before a Supreme Court that was prepared to do neither. He embarked on an anti-pornography crusade, an odd priority for someone whose mission also includes fighting organized crime. He botched the early stages of the Iran-Contra probe, perhaps deliberately. Yet, Meese has shown one thing. An &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s politics are not as important as his credibility, his honesty and his ability to lead. After three years with a laughingstock for a leader, Justice needs an &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; of high personal reputation. But the department must wait for the next administration to provide one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  british french france britain london paris mrs thatcher prime european minister union sweden margaret europe germany community britain\\'s australia major &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.507765602073666  \\n   Garri Kasparov of the Soviet Union moved into first place Sunday in the World Cup Chess Championship with a 10th round victory over Ulf Andersson of Sweden.

The decision by the 12 EC nations gives jobless nationals in the European Community the same rights as wage-earners. An elderly citizen who has dreamed of retiring in sunnier southern climates will be able to obtain a five-year, renewable residency permit in the EC country of his choice. The retiree must show only proof of health insurance and that he or she will not burden the adopted nation\\'s social security system. And a student who can show proof of registration at a university or college in another EC nation as well as sufficient income will receive a one-year renewable residency permit. Those who are unemployed by choice and do not classify as being either elderly or a student will have to prove they have sufficient income not to need assistance from the social security system in their new country. The 12 EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. In 1992, the nations will drop trade barriers among themselves to create a unified Euromarket. In Brussels Wednesday the 18 nations of Western Europe\\'s two trading blocs began talks to pave the way for the so-called European Economic Space. The move would bring the six nations of the European Free Trade Association _ Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland _ closer to the European Community. Frans Andriessen, an EC commissioner, said he hoped broad agreement would be reached near the end of this year and be fully implemented on Jan. 1, 1993, when the EC\\'s single market comes into force. &lt;/p&gt; 0.317949177023953  \\n   Luxembourg takes over the European Community\\'s presidency on Tuesday, with war looming in the Persian Gulf, world trade talks in disarray and Europe in full transformation. The Grand Duchy, a tiny speck on the map with only about 0.1 percent of the population in the 12-nation community, has a good track record in handling the rotating six-month EC presidencies. Jacques Santer, &lt;b&gt; prime &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; minister &lt;/b&gt; of the 378,400 Luxembourgers, is convinced the mouse will roar again when his country takes over the community\\'s presidency from Italy as 1991 begins. ``During all of our presidencies we always came up with results,\\'\\' Santer said in a recent interview. Five years ago, the Luxembourg presidency paved the way for the Single European Act, an updated constitution that pushes the trade bloc toward creating a truly unified market after 1992. This time around, new initiatives to create economic, monetary and political &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; by the turn of the century have been thrust into Santer\\'s lap. The Christian Democrat plans to act as a mediator between the EC\\'s powerhouses - Germany, France and Britain - to finalize the blueprint for European unity. ``Because we are so small, the others do not suspect us of having ulterior self-serving motives,\\'\\' he said. Shoehorned between Germany, France and Belgium, Luxembourg occupies a key crossroads on the continent, straddling Europe\\'s main cultures - the Romanic and Germanic. It is also well-connected with both the rich north and poor south in the community. The Persian Gulf crisis might prove the first test of Luxembourg\\'s mettle. The EC has said it would not hold talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz unless the United States first reaches agreement with Iraq on exchanging foreign ministers\\' visits. If the EC agrees to talk with Iraq, that task would fall to Luxembourg\\'s Foreign Minister Jacques Poos. During Luxembourg\\'s six months, a lot of energy will be spent on two conferences - one on economic and monetary union, the other on political &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; -to pave the way for a more unified Europe. Disarray reigns on how fast monetary &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; should be achieved, Santer said. He said calls for an independent EC defense organization are not realistic and it remains ``essential that we keep a partnership with the United States\\'\\' within NATO - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The partnership with Washington has been strained in global trade, where the EC has resisted U.S. proposals that it reduce price supports and subsidies for farmers. The agricultural dispute blocked an agreement in world trade talks held in Brussels, Belgium earlier this month. The talks are to resume in Geneva next month. Santer, stressing the progress that has been made in the other 14 sectors covered by the trade talks, said farming should not block an overall accord. He argued in favor of a final deal that, if need be, excludes agriculture. &lt;/p&gt; 0.312941082165462  \\n   Britain\\'s beleaguered trade secretary, Nicholas Ridley, came home Friday night from a trade visit to Hungary and expectations were he will resign after his charge that West Germany wanted to take over a united Europe. His comments in a magazine interview, which he later retracted, provoked cross-party calls for his resignation and were denounced in Germany, France and other European countries. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused Friday to answer questions about Ridley\\'s political future, reportedly leaving the first move up to him. But even rank-and-file members of her Conservative Party, who applaud his warning of German supremacy over a united Europe, said he will have to go. Sir Marcus Fox, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory lawmakers, told BBC Radio 4 that Ridley\\'s position was now ``very bad.\\'\\' Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons on Thursday that Ridley was not reflecting government policy, nor her own views, but she rejected demands for his dismissal. Ridley, 61, the outspoken and controversial son of Viscount Ridley, is considered Mrs. Thatcher\\'s closest ideological ally in the Cabinet. Political commentators said his departure would be a blow to her. In the interview with the conservative weekly, the Spectator, Ridley said the West German government\\'s support for European monetary &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; ``is all a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to be thwarted. ``This rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely intolerable.\\'\\' Ridley said he opposed yielding sovereignty to the 12-nation European Community, which he said was run by ``17 unelected reject politicians.\\'\\' He said: ``You might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly.\\'\\' Earlier Friday night, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made the government\\'s first move to repair the damage to Anglo-European relations. Speaking at the Anglo-American conference center near Oxford, Hurd said: ``Our alliance, our partnership and our friendship with France and Germany lie at the heart of modern British foreign policy. ``Lingering memories from the past do not prevent us from strengthening, month by month, the practical proofs of that friendship. ``Irreversible also is the steadily increasing cooperation with the fellow members and institutions of the European Community of which the &lt;b&gt; prime &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; minister &lt;/b&gt; spoke after the Dublin (EEC) summit (last month). ``Nothing will now put these processes in doubt.\\'\\' Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Liberal Democratic Party, said: ``The issue has now become not Mr. Ridley\\'s folly but Mrs. Thatcher\\'s judgment. By refusing to sack him, she is multiplying the insult of his outrageous views.\\'\\' Gordon Brown, the opposition Labor Party\\'s trade spokesman, said she was guilty of a ``dismal failure of leadership\\'\\' for leaving the decision about Ridley\\'s future in his hands. ``With this indecision following on top of the Ridley insults, her inaction today signifies an astonishing abdication of responsibility that will make Britain the subject of, at best, ridicule, and at worst, hostility throughout Europe,\\'\\' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  club animals species members animal endangered wild hunter metropolitan quayle habitat wildlife elephants golf natural skins thailand order membership club\\'s &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.480141393583948  \\n   The owner of two Indian &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; says he\\'ll agree to sell the 3{-ton &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; if their former owner, who apparently has been hiding the pachyderms for four years, will return them. Richard Drake, owner of a now-closed Tehachapi, Calif., &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; farm, said Sunday he wants to get fair market value for the 27-year-old female elephants, appraised at $70,000 apiece. Drake said he has spent ``thousands and thousands of dollars\\'\\' crisscrossing the country searching for Arlan Seidon, the man who fled with the elephants, Tory and Duchess. Seidon, who raised the elphants from infancy, contacted The Star Ledger of Newark several weeks ago from an undisclosed location and said he would return to face charges of third-degree theft if the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; were not given to Drake. Seidon sold the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; to the Drakes for $80,000 in 1981 but said he repossessed the &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; for non-payment. The Drakes successfully fought the action and in May 1984 Superior Court Judge Peter Thomas awarded them $107,000 in damages. Seidon also charged that Drake, 50, and his son, Edward, 30, abused the animals. The Drakes deny that charge. Seidon, 58, fled with the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; from a farm in Colts Neck Township while the &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; were with a circus in New Jersey. He has been on the lam ever since. ``It\\'s been at a standstill for four years,\\'\\' Drake said from his sister\\'s Far Hills home. ``We have to do something.\\'\\' Drake said Sunday he had contacted Seidon\\'s attorney, Isabelle Strauss of East Orange, and was awaiting an answer to his proposal. Ms. Strauss, an &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; activist, was not in her office today for additional comment, a secretary said. She told The Star Ledger on Saturday that Seidon, who phones her periodically, would not allow the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; to go to &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; brokers who would sell them to other people. Ms. Strauss said a Vermont businessman is interested in the &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; and that she is trying to work out a deal. Ms. Strauss has said she does not know where or how Seidon has been concealing the elephants. Seidon has said he left his farm at Fordland, Mo., and his career preparing &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; for circus and television appearances to care for the elephants, which eat about 200 pounds off hay a day. He said he hasn\\'t seen his four children or met his only grandson since he took off with the animals. &lt;/p&gt; 0.443985526522564  \\n   The discovery of two &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; of the daddy-longlegs insect family in Edgewood County Park may block a proposed 18-hole &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course. Both &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; are called the Edgewood Park harvestman, of Sitalcina minor. They live only in serpentine rock formations in the park\\'s hills, and several conservationists want the habitate to be preserved. ``Constructing a &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course would wipe out the whole harvestmen populations,\\'\\' said Thomas F. Briggs, a science teacher at San Francisco Lowell High School. ``These are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world,\\'\\' he added. Briggs discovered one of the &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; in 1983 and the other in 1985. Both have eight legs, and bright orange-red bodies that measure about 1 millimeter. Unlike spiders, daddy-longlegs do not spin webs. Along with Darrell Ubick, an entomologist, Briggs has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected creature, which could halt any development of their only known habitat. San Mateo County purchased the 468-acre site in 1980 from the state and has been attempting to build a &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course there for several years. ``This little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course,\\'\\' said Barbara Kootz of nearby San Carlos, a golfer and leader of pro-development interests in the area. &lt;/p&gt; 0.437763169939778  \\n   Endangered &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; pop up in the strangest places. Like flowerbeds. Plant-protection activists say some &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; of bulbs bought to decorate American and European gardens are being collected by the millions in the wild, threatening to wipe out those flowers in their home turf. ``The world would lose an irreplaceable treasure,\\'\\' said Marjorie Arundel of Warrenton, Va., an adviser to the Garden Club of America\\'s horticulture committee. ``They\\'re the ancestors of all of our spring bulbs today.\\'\\' Mrs. Arundel and other activists are urging American gardeners to buy only commercially propagated plants, which experts say make up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway. ``Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade, but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants,\\'\\' said Faith Campbell, director of the plant conservation program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of America, the NRDC has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to avoid most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or snowdrops, which they say are collected in the &lt;b&gt; wild &lt;/b&gt; in Turkey. Those three &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; are listed as &lt;b&gt; endangered &lt;/b&gt; in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. But this treaty _ effective in fighting trade in some &lt;b&gt; endangered &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; skins, horns and tusks _ has had little effect on the flower trade, Ms. Campbell said. Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey\\'s Mediterranean regions, forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions. The popular ``Angel\\'s Tears\\'\\' narcissus are being collected in the wild, but experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or somewhere else. Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from the &lt;b&gt; wild &lt;/b&gt; in the United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and the Soviet Union appear to be the sources for still other rare flowers. Some &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; of these plants may be produced by growers in the United States or Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check the origins as carefully as they can. This may become easier, as a result of the decision last May by the Dutch Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to require exporters to use a ``Bulbs from Wild Sources\\'\\' label to identify wild-collected plants. Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label their cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; and in 1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths. Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower trade, the action by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major impact, Ms. Campbell said. It is not binding, though, on dealers in the United States or other countries. Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall\\'s catalogs. So even if American gardeners &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; from Dutch dealers covered by the rules, they might not know they were buying wild-collected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail, labeled ``wild sources.\\'\\' ``We can just hope they won\\'t &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; those again,\\'\\' Ms. Campbell said. ``It is a messy phasing-in.\\'\\' The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in Turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting &lt;b&gt; wild &lt;/b&gt; flowers to start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat, she said. Gardeners shouldn\\'t think they\\'re aiding nature by keeping alive a &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; that might be disappearing in its native habitat. ``We don\\'t consider that a contribution to conservation in any way,\\'\\' Ms. Campbell said. ``It\\'s not playing its role in the ecosystem in which it evolved.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.421592774982234  \\n   Entomologists say they want &lt;b&gt; endangered &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; protection for a recently rediscovered butterfly that experts believed had been extinct for more than 50 years. Paul Hammond, an Oregon State University entomologist and butterfly expert, said he rediscovered the butterflies by accident. ``In the spring of 1989 I hiked out onto a south-facing slope of a hill that had native prairie on it, and here was this very unusual kind of lupine plant with all these little blue butterflies swimming around on it. ``I knew immediately what it was,\\'\\' he said. It was Fender\\'s blue butterfly, a relic of the ice ages found only in Oregon\\'s Willamette Valley. The butterfly was last seen near the small town of Wren, west of Corvallis, in 1937. Since that find last year, several pockets of the &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; have been found in western Oregon. A petition is being prepared to ask the U.S. Fish and Wildlife to declare the butterfly a threatened &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; under the federal Endangered Species Act. Hammond said the butterfly has a wingspan of only about 1 inch. The male is a ``brilliant, iridescent blue,\\'\\' he said. ``They really stand out. The female is a drab brown.\\'\\' The butterfly dates back more than 10,000 years, Hammond said. Surrounded by glaciers to the north and mountains to the south, east and west, the butterfly\\'s &lt;b&gt; habitat &lt;/b&gt; was limited to a small area of the Willamette Valley. &lt;/p&gt; 0.376721114005934  \\n   A zoo advocacy group is calling for an investigation into the cause of a half-dozen puncture wounds on the head and face of an elephant that injured a veterinarian who was trying to treat the wounds. ``What we\\'re talking about here is abuse,\\'\\' Sandra Keller, spokeswoman for Citizens for a Better Zoo, said Sunday. ``We have been receiving complaints about the way these &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; are being mistreated for several months.\\'\\' Veterinarian Gail Hedberg was treating an abscess on the head of a 3{-ton Asian elephant named Tinkerbelle when the &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; attacked her Saturday, fracturing her pelvis. Zookeepers said Tinkerbelle did a ``handstand\\'\\' on the woman. Hedberg was listed in stable condition today at San Francisco General Hospital. Some officials defended practices at the San Francisco Zoo. ``We have to use elephant hooks and other methods that may appear abusive because we\\'re not talking about puppy dogs and pussy cats here,\\'\\' said zoo director Saul Kitchener. ``How do you get a 10,000-pound elephant\\'s attention?\\'\\' Elephant keeper Michele Radovsky said beating an elephant is no different from ``people taking rolled newspapers and hitting their dog.\\'\\' But Paul Hunter, a keeper at the zoo for nine years, said the abscess on Tinkerbell\\'s head was caused by someone hitting her too hard with a hooked instrument called an ankuf or elephant hook. ``The &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; get beaten up real bad, and I\\'m getting tired of it,\\'\\' said Hunter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  environmental plant waste nuclear pollution water epa energy chemical plants power industry environment garbage air area site creek company tank &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.504413804597327  \\n   Researchers have discovered small quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from Savannah Harbor about 100 miles downstream from the Savannah River Plant. Cesium 137, a radioactive isotope, was found in material taken from the harbor and dumped on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River, which forms the border with Georgia. Tests found tiny amounts of the material, insufficient to create a health hazard, The Charleston News &amp; Courier reported today. The tests were done for the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department by researchers at the University of Georgia. The wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants because of &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; quality problems believed to be caused by industrial discharges into the river, agency officials said. Cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; fission, and is generally associated with radioactive waste. It emits beta and gamma radiation, both of which can produce a variety of ill effects, depending on the dosage. Lou Gordell, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; division at the &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; plant, said he had not been informed of the study results, but acknowledged Monday that the material probably originated at the Savannah &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; plant. The complex near Aiken produces the radioactive materials plutonium and tritium for &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons. The government-owned &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed that a series of accidents at the &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; over the past 30 years went unreported to the public. Gordell said sediment tests in Savannah Harbor for a 1984 study showed traces of Cesium 137, and that recent monitoring upstream found similar traces both in the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; and river sediment. Much of the material leaked from SRP apparatus in the 1950s, but some is the result of continued discharge into the river, Gordell said. The level of contamination is far below EPA\\'s maximum allowable level for drinking water, he said. Savannah and Beaufort-Jasper counties pump &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; from the Savannah River for drinking water. Traces of tritium also are found in the river, but also are below the maximum allowable levels, Gordell said. Cesium 137, with a half-life of 30 years, persists in the &lt;b&gt; environment &lt;/b&gt; longer than tritium, with a half-life of 12 years. A half-life is the time it takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate. The Savannah Harbor is periodically dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain its depth for the port of Savannah. &lt;/p&gt; 0.435779215217155  \\n   A Massachusetts &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; is making money out of &lt;b&gt; garbage &lt;/b&gt; through new recycling methods for cities swimming in the refuse of a throwaway society. Public landfills are clogged with paper, glass, aluminum and plastic, and less than 10 percent of 160 million tons of &lt;b&gt; garbage &lt;/b&gt; produced yearly in the United States is recycled, according to David Spencer, president and founder of wTe Corp. in Bedford. His &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; develops methods for processing &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; to recover ferrous metal and other substances. The &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; also runs trash-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; under contract with cities, and joined with such companies as Dow Chemical Co. to develop plastics recycling technology. At a research station at the University of California at Berkeley, wTe hauls in barrels of trash to experiment with ways to separate components for recycling and &lt;b&gt; energy &lt;/b&gt; conversion. Spencer, 44, believes recycling and recovery, which is the process of extracting certain components of trash, will become increasingly important as cities run out of land to bury refuse, long the cheapest and easiest disposal method. ``Everything we manufacture in this country finds its way into the &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; stream. ... It all winds up on a trash truck,\\'\\' Spencer said in a recent interview. ``To look at the increase in garbage, just look at the GNP.\\'\\' Spencer acknowledged that recovery and recycling operations are costly for cash-strapped municipalities, which must weigh such expenses as housing for the elderly against recycling programs. It often may be less expensive in the short run to bury &lt;b&gt; garbage &lt;/b&gt; in a landfill, but in the long run ``yesterday\\'s landfill is today\\'s superfund site,\\'\\' he said. Spencer, who has degrees in metallurgy and materials science, is a Philadelphia native who, after attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, founded Waste Energy Technology Corp. in 1981. The name was changed to wTe in 1987. Now a $20 million, privately held &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; with 220 employees, wTe\\'s operations include a waste-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; and recycling facility in Akron, Ohio, waste-recovery projects in Dade County, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio, and, through a subsidiary, a polystyrene recycling project in Brooklyn, N.Y. In Bedford, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; runs the city\\'s curbside recycling program. Columbus has wTe under contract to use a magnetic process to extract ferrous metal from the city\\'s &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; stream before &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; is burned in the city\\'s incinerator. That makes the burning process less abrasive and wearing on city equipment. It also reduces the toxic level in and the amount of ash left over, said Tim Barr, deputy director of Columbus public utilities. Ray Kapper, Akron director of public services, said wTe was brought in to run the city\\'s waste-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; after problems with hazardous &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; and an explosion in which three people died. Such &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; burn &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; to produce steam and other forms of energy. Under contract with Amoco Corp., wTe developed a process for the McDonald\\'s Corp. chain to recycle polystyrene containers tossed away with half-eaten hamburgers and paper. The extracted material is turned into trays and other products for Rubbermaid Inc. Recycling methods can be environmentally benign. For example, discarded tires, long an urban eyesore, can be burned safely to create energy, Spencer says. The 300,000 to 500,000 tires discarded in Akron annually are shredded and fed into the waste-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; during winter, when people traditionally throw out less trash but &lt;b&gt; energy &lt;/b&gt; needs are greater, he said. Spencer said his interest in recycling comes from a lifelong hatred of seeing anything go to waste. ``My mother used to get the squeak out of the pig, as they say,\\'\\' he said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.419788158052852  \\n   Radioactive gas leaked from the Connecticut Yankee &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; for 10 minutes Monday morning, but no one was injured and there was no danger to the public or employees, a spokeswoman said. The release of xenon-krypton occurred while technicians were taking a test sample, Northeast Utilities spokeswoman Barbara Luce. She said the accident did not affect operations at the plant. The spokeswoman said the release was measured as two-hundredths of a millirem, a unit used to measure radiation exposure. By comparison, she said, a diagnostic chest x-ray involves between 20 and 30 millirems of radiation. Luce also said that there are daily, planned releases of the gas of less than a millirem. The gas is produced during fission. The utility notifed state and government officials of the accident and were investigating, Luce said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.395006873442712  \\n   At least two companies hired by the Energy Department as independent investigators of &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; and safety conditions at &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; are on the payroll at facilities they investigated, government records show. Others participating in the audits had bid for Energy Department contracts at sites they investigated, although they were not yet working there. Still others, while not associated with the &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; they audited, are the Energy Department\\'s prime contractors at other &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; bomb factories. Written department guidelines for carrying out the ``independent tiger team\\'\\' investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding organizational conflicts of interest. It defines such a conflict as a situation in which a contractor ``has past, present or currently planned interests that either directly or indirectly ... may relate to the work to be performed\\'\\' and which may bias its judgment. The tiger teams were assembled by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins last summer to give an independent view of the plants\\' compliance with state and federal environmental, safety and health standards. The auditing work is meant to lay the groundwork for actions to correct unsafe and illegal practices at the plants. Virtually all 17 major weapons facilities have severe &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; problems; estimates of the cost of cleaning up production wastes are as high as $100 billion. Watkins publicly stressed the independence of the tiger teams but did not explain that many of the experts would be tied to the weapons business. The Energy Department, which owns the plants, declined to comment on whether the contractors\\' connections to the weapons &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; amount to a conflict of interest that undermines the independence of the investigations or taints the findings. Department spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said the department would prefer to use its own employees for this work, ``but we don\\'t have the people to do it.\\'\\' Each team is headed by a small number of department officials, but most of the scientific work is done by contract employees. Most have extensive backgrounds in &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; and safety matters. A review of department records as well as interviews with government and &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; officials show that of the eight weapons &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; investigations done last year, at least three involved companies that held other Energy Department contracts at the same sites or were bidding for contract work at those facilities. _The engineering and &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; consulting firm NUS Corp. of Gaithersburg, Md., was on the tiger team that investigated the Y-12 uranium processing &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; at Oak Ridge, Tenn., last fall. According to department records, NUS at the same time was working for the Oak Ridge reservation on an &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; study of its &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; and hazardous &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; management. The Y-12 &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; is one of several operations at the Oak Ridge reservation. NUS\\'s Oak Ridge contract was awarded Nov. 8, 1988, and was valued at $1.4 million. The firm also holds contracts at weapons facilities in South Carolina and Idaho. NUS spokesman Don Couchman declined to discuss any aspect of the firm\\'s work for the Energy Department. _Science Applications International Corp. of La Jolla, Calif., helped evaluate the Nevada Test Site, which conducts underground &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons tests. The &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; at the same time was working at the &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; under two Energy Department contracts with a combined value of $100 million. Most of its work is at a proposed high-level &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; dump at the &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; that was not part of the tiger team audit. _ICF Kaiser Engineers, an engineering and construction &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; based in Oakland, Calif., participated in tiger team audits at the Nevada Test Site. ICF held no Energy Department contracts at the test &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; at the time of the investigation last November, but it was bidding for a $5 million job to help the facility\\'s prime contractor, Reynolds Electrical &amp; Engineering Co., Inc., develop and carry out an &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; cleanup program there. ICF Kaiser announced it won the contract 10 days after the on-site tiger team work ended Dec. 1. Similarly, records show the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; participated in tiger team investigations at the Fernald uranium processing &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; in Ohio and the Y-12 Oak Ridge &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; while it was a bidder for major Energy Department contracts at both sites. The contract at Oak Ridge is valued at $505 million over five years, according to Bob Lynch, deputy director of the department\\'s field office there. Marc Tipermas, executive vice president of ICF, said in a telephone interview that he saw no conflict of interest in his company\\'s involvement in the tiger team work. He said he was not sure whether, in choosing ICF for the work, the department knew or cared about the company\\'s other work at the weapons plants. ``In order to get this job done well and quickly, contractors had to be used,\\'\\' Tipermas said. ``Like many other companies, we were drafted. We were helter-skelter pulled onto these teams.\\'\\' The Energy Department has used private contractors to run the &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; since they were built as part of the World War II Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. The contracting system has left the department with little internal expertise in this &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; and a tendency to rely on the weapons makers to police themselves. Watkins strongly advocates hiring more federal employees with environmental, safety and health expertise to lessen the dependence on private contractors. Although the department insists that the tiger team members\\' links to the weapons &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; do not compromise their objectivity as judges of &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; and safety conditions at the plants, some outside experts disagree. ``It\\'s inevitably a potential conflict when a contractor is reviewing another contractor, and the reason is that any possible criticism of one contractor might lead to future business for another contractor,\\'\\' said Donald F. Kettl, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University and author of a book on government use of contractors. Other tiger team members included companies in charge of running &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons plants, though not the ones they investigated. These include EG&amp;G Inc., which is the prime contractor at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; near Denver, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory at Idaho Falls, which processes naval &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; fuels, and the Mound Laboratory near Dayton, Ohio, which makes detonators for &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; arms. Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs the Oak Ridge facilities, participated in some other audits, as did subsidiaries of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which runs several weapons sites, and Mason and Hangar Silas Mason Co., operator of the Pantex final weapons assembly &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; near Amarillo, Texas. &lt;/p&gt; 0.386319810983077  \\n   Initial tests by a Washington apple grower have identified an organic &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; that may serve as a substitute for Alar, which was banned as a probable carcinogen last year after a national scare. But a scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday it was too early to tell if the grower\\'s initial results will hold up, and that the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; would require at least two more years of study. Eric Curry of the USDA in Wenatchee said such testing generally requires three orchards in three locations around the state for three years. Spray-N-Grow, a Houston-based company, said initial results on an orchard owned by a Yakima-area grower found trees treated with the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; produced apples with a significant increase in uniformity of color, sweetness, firmness and harvest time over untreated apples. Bill Muskopf, president of Spray-N-Grow, said the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; ``provides the same benefits (as Alar) while remaining completely organic and totally non-toxic.\\'\\' Alar was a synthetic &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; growers used for two decades before a private consumer group issued a report last year saying consumption of apples treated with the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; increased cancer risk in children. The Environmental Protection Agency banned the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; later in the year. Unlike Alar, Spray-N-Grow is an organic chemical, a micronutrient that has been proven non-toxic in private tests, &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; officials said. It has been used by commercial vegetable growers and home gardeners for several years, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said. The Alar scare pushed prices for organic apples far above those for chemically treated apples. Organically grown red apples were selling for $1.29 at a Seattle market Thursday, compared to 39 cents per pound for other red apples. Alar\\'s most significant benefit was retaining the internal firmness of apples during months of cold storage. That will be tested with the new &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; this year, Spray-N-Grow said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  abortion women humphrey souter state rights abortions anti-abortion hampshire gilbert adkins issues pregnant pregnancy woman smith birth souter\\'s control legal &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.417174672343128  \\n   Feminist leaders said Friday the clock would be turned back 25 years on women\\'s &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; if David Souter is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. ``If we lose this one, we\\'ll never get it back,\\'\\' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, who is lobbying the Senate to reject the nominee. Smeal said she had read all 200 of Souter\\'s &lt;b&gt; legal &lt;/b&gt; opinions and believes he would work to cut off women\\'s access to &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; and abortion. Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Souter revealed his opposition to &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; by calling it the ``killing of unborn children.\\'\\' ``That\\'s the language of the right wing,\\'\\' Yard said. Souter did not use the words during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings this week, but while New Hampshire attorney general he signed a brief that contained the language. However, during the hearings Friday, Souter said he has not made up his mind on the &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; issue and would consider both sides if he is confirmed. ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs. Wade,\\'\\' Souter in reference to the case that legalized abortion. ``I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up my mind and I would not go on the court saying I must go one way or I must go the other way.\\'\\' But Yard said that Souter\\'s repeated reference to the &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; position as ``the other side,\\'\\' was evidence of where he stood. Smeal and Yard, who have attended most of the hearings, said Souter\\'s answers to questions on constitutionally protected privacy &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; concerning &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; indicated he believed in the concept for married couples, but left open whether single people had the same right. Smeal said the addition of Souter to the court would create the majority needed to whittle away at a woman\\'s right to &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; until access no longer existed. ``It would take about 10 years,\\'\\' she said. ``First would be a requirement that teen-agers get parental consent for an abortion, then spousal consent.\\'\\' She predicted the court then would restrict the time period in which an &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; could be performed and then limit the kind of facility that could do the operation. Those decisions would be followed by requirements that teen-agers get parental consent for &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; requiring a physician\\'s prescription and later that &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; get their husbands\\' consent, Smeal said. ``The last step would be outlawing the sale of &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; to single people,\\'\\' she said. ``That would take us back to 1965.\\'\\' That year, in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a case involving the sale of contraceptives, the court for the first time recognized a constitutional right of privacy. The decision led to widespread availability of &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; for married and unmarried people. Smeal said women\\'s ability to get out from under the burden of unwanted pregnancies have been the key to the many advances they have been able to achieve outside the home. Smeal and Yard spoke to a rally organized by NOW across the street from the Capitol. About 150 people opposing the Souter nomination attended. &lt;/p&gt; 0.378563889866307  \\n   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a steadfast foe of legalized abortion, said Friday he has softened his stand for the tactical reason of finally getting an updated &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; law passed in New Hampshire. The conservative Republican, who is running for a &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Senate seat even though he retires in January from the U.S. Senate after two terms, said he has long supported &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; only to save the woman\\'s life, but now would support exceptions for rape and incest victims. In a telephone interview from his Chichester home, Humphrey said he\\'s easing his stance ``because that\\'s probably the only way that we can get a bill passed and signed into law that would address the 95 percent of &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; that have nothing to do with rape, incest or the life of the mother.\\'\\' Earlier this year, Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a bill that would have made &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; legal &lt;/b&gt; until the fetus could live outside the womb. Last year, Gregg vetoed a bill to repeal the state\\'s existing &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; laws, which date from the mid-1800s. Humphrey faces &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Rep. Jack Sherburne in the Sept. 11 Republican primary. Sherburne favors &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; rights, as does the incumbent, Republican William Johnson, who is running for Congress. Humphrey said his beliefs haven\\'t changed and that he hopes the public eventually will agree with him that ``each &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; kills a human being, and a human being is a human being irrespective of his circumstances of conception.\\'\\' Asked if he would revert to opposing exceptions for rape and incest if the political climate were favorable, Humphrey said, ``That would be my preference. But I don\\'t expect to see that day.\\'\\' He said he had not discussed his new position with &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; supporters, but expects some criticism. Warren Aldrich, legislative director for New Hampshire For L.I.F.E., would not comment directly on Humphrey\\'s change, but said his group ``would not take part in sponsoring or originating a bill that permits the taking of an unborn human life because of the circumstances of its conception.\\'\\' ``Rape and incest are tragic assaults on a woman\\'s life, but we do not believe that &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; is in any way therapeutic for the woman,\\'\\' he said. Peg Dobbie, &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, was surprised by Humphrey\\'s new stance. ``He seems like the guy who\\'s above it, the maverick who stands up for his convictions no matter what,\\'\\' she said. Even with the modifications, Humphrey\\'s stance ``is a very extreme &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; position,\\'\\' Dobbie said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.332828481610135  \\n   Radio dispatcher Jani Kochever received a very special early morning call from Clark County Sheriff\\'s Deputy Greg Chaney, known on the air as code number 140. ``Control 2, 140,\\'\\' Chaney said Tuesday. ``Personal request.\\'\\' ``Go ahead,\\'\\' replied Ms. Kochever, known on the radio as Control 2. ``Jani, will you marry me?\\'\\' Chaney asked. ``She sat there with her mouth open,\\'\\' said fellow dispatcher Pam Shurtliff. ``I almost answered for her. I was going to say, `Yeah, she\\'ll marry you.\\'\\'\\' When Ms. Kochever recovered, she replied, ``140, Control 2, absolutely I\\'ll marry you. ``And then another deputy said, `You can\\'t back out now, because we\\'re all witnesses,\\'\\'\\' the bride-to-be recalled. Ms. Kochever said she and Chaney had been dating about 10 months, but she had no hint he would make his graveyard-shift proposal. No wedding date has been set, but stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt; 0.323243998011928  \\n   The Idaho House voted Thursday to repeal the state\\'s &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; ``trigger law,\\'\\' which sets criminal penalties of up to five years in prison both for physicians who perform and &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; who get abortions. In developments elsewhere, Cincinnati\\'s archbishop asked &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinic operators to voluntarily refrain from Holy Communion, and Planned Parenthood said it would appeal a ruling upholding the federal government\\'s right to bar family planning aid to foreign organizations that perform abortions. And in Alabama, a bill that would require pre-abortion counseling and an overnight wait prior to any &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; passed the House of Representatives 79-18 on Thursday. But the measure faces tough election-year opposition in the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Senate. With little debate, Idaho House members voted 54-28 to erase the so-called trigger law, which wouldn\\'t take effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to outlaw abortion. The repeal measure was forwarded to the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Senate, where it was expected to pass. ``I don\\'t think anyone in this House would like the &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; of Idaho to be subject to criminal penalties for having an abortion,\\'\\' said Rep. Gary Robbins, a Democrat who introduced the repeal measure. ``I think the &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; of Idaho are able to make their own choices, and if they do so I don\\'t think they ought to be penalized.\\'\\' The law was adopted by the Legislature in 1973, shortly after the Supreme Court\\'s Roe vs. Wade decision essentially legalizing &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; on demand through the first two trimesters of pregnancy. If it were to go into effect, the Idaho law would mandate prison terms of two to five years for physicians who perform &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; and one to five years for &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; undergoing them. The law couldn\\'t take effect under provisions of Roe vs. Wade, hence the ``trigger\\'\\' desingation. If the high court were to overturn that landmark ruling, and allow states to once again ban abortion, the Idaho law would take effect on a proclamation by the governor. In the Idaho House debate Thursday, &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; lawmakers argued that lifting the threat of criminal penalties ignores the &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; of the unborn. ``Some of us are here to speak for those who can\\'t speak for themselves. Do they not count for something?\\'\\' asked Rep. Elizabeth Allan-Hodge, a Republican. ``For those of us who believe it is murder to kill the unborn, we cannot possibly believe we should slap them on the hand and tell them it\\'s wrong.\\'\\' In Cincinnati, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk said Wednesday that Roman Catholics who operate &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics or promote &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; shouldn\\'t receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. The head of the Cincinnati Archdiocese stopped short of excommunicating or forbidding Holy Communion to pro-choice activists. ``Catholics who obstinately persist in these activities, while perhaps not formally excommunicated, should not consider themselves properly disposed to participate in receiving Holy Communion,\\'\\' Pilarczyk said. Pilarcayk\\'s statement was released after a meeting with &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; opponents who complained that Barbara Rinto, a Catholic who is the new director of Planned Parenthood of Cncinnati, violates church law by operating a clinic that performs abortions. Ms. Rinto has said that her feelings on &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; are ``between me and my God,\\'\\' and that her beliefs about &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; and reproduction are private. In New York, Planned Parenthood announced Thursday it would appeal a ruling by a federal judge there that upheld a federal policy _ instituted under the Reagan administration and continued under President Bush _ barring family planning aid to private foreign organizations that perform abortions. The policy, adopted by the Agency for International Development 1984, requires that foreign private health agencies, in return for American grants, certify that they didn\\'t perform or actively promote &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; as a method of family planning. Planned Parenthood, which assists private foreign agencies, had charged that the policy was a violation of their First Amendment right to advocate &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; and interfered with the &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; of privacy of people seeking family planning information. &lt;/p&gt; 0.321669305819114  \\n   A federal judge approved a settlement Thursday that keeps the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; from restricting &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; less than 18 weeks pregnant. U.S. District Judge John Nordberg agreed to the settlement between Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The court finds the proposed consent decree lawful, fair, reasonable and adequate,\\'\\' the judge wrote in the 13-page opinion. Anti-abortion groups opposed the settlement, calling it ``unconscionable and unconstitutional.\\'\\' Ragsdale vs. Turnock was settled Nov. 24, just days before the U.S. Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the case. It was one of several that &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; groups had hoped would be used as a test case for the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The settlement permits the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; to regulate &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics without removing the availability of &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; who are less than 18 weeks pregnant. Under the agreement, access to &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; cannot be restricted by substantially increasing the cost of the procedure or reducing the number of clinics. The lawsuit was brought by Rockford physician Richard Ragsdale, who objected to regulations requiring &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics to be equipped and staffed like small hospitals. He said the regulation was a veiled attempt to restrict access to abortions. One of the requirements deleted from the settlement mandated that patients receive counseling about &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; and adoption and that counselors be people who wouldn\\'t profit from abortions. The settlement also eliminated a requirement that all &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a ``certificate of need\\'\\' from the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; verifying that they do not duplicate similar services in their areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  united states trade japan countries foreign world japanese international american economic nations agreement european imports canada europe talks farm america &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.546147065172188  \\n   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and European Economic Community officials agreed Tuesday to step up &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; contacts. Takeshita responded favorably to a suggestion by EEC Commission President Jacques Delors to create a panel of experts to discuss technical aspects of the EEC\\'s rocky &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relations with Japan, officials said. Takeshita also stressed the need for Japan and the 12-nation EEC to widen their relations beyond &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; to cultural and scientific sectors. ``The relationship between Europe and Japan is not very strong or as well developed\\'\\' as that between the United States with Europe and Japan, an aide to Takeshita told reporters. Senior EEC and Japanese officials meet annually. An EEC official said Delors believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in defusing &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; tensions. The EEC is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of dumping by Japanese exporters. The EEC official, who asked not to be named, said EEC Foreign Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq noted a ``remarkable improvement in &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relations\\'\\' between the 12-nation &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; bloc and Japan, even though the EEC continues to register a large &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; deficit with Japan. The gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987, but was still $25 billion. For his part, Takeshita said the EEC\\'s plans to turn the 12 EEC &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; into a single, borderless market by the end of 1992 was good for Japan. But his aide quoted him as saying, ``The ... single market after 1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world\\'\\' and that the EEC should remove restrictions on Japanese exports. But he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade, an issue the EEC has given high priority in order to gain greater access for European goods to the Japanese market. ``We fully understand what (the EEC) Commission people are saying on reciprocity but Japan cannot agree to reciprocity on a sectoral basis,\\'\\' Takeshita was quoted as saying. Among specific &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; issues discussed were Japan\\'s high taxes on imported liquor and cars, the difficulties of &lt;b&gt; foreign &lt;/b&gt; companies\\' bidding on Japanese public works projects and better access for EEC exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors. The EEC side also urged Japan to liberalize its banking sector. Officials said Delors stressed European banks must be able to establish themselves in Japan to make it easier to finance European exports and investments. De Clercq also called on Japan to quickly comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruling to amend an accord with the United States on &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; in semiconductors. The &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; body has ruled the deal discriminates against the EEC. Takeshita also asked Delors\\' advice as to the best way to distribute $500 million Japan has earmarked as special &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; assistance to Africa. ``We are aware that European &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; have a long relationship with African countries,\\'\\' the aide quoted Takeshita as saying. &lt;/p&gt; 0.522992875103849  \\n   The United States and Japan reached a &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; Monday that could double U.S. exports of beef and oranges to more than $1 billion a year, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. ``My judgment is that this will turn out to be a landmark &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; in U.S.-Japan &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; relations,\\'\\' Yeutter said following marathon &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; with Japanese leaders. The &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; calls on Japan to nearly double its &lt;b&gt; imports &lt;/b&gt; of beef by 1991, and phase out involvement by Livestock Industry Promotion Corp., which currently controls most beef imports. Japan would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 1991, 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to allow Japanese farmers time to adjust. Japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22,000 tons annually, to 192,000 tons in 1990. After that, fresh oranges from the United States would be permitted in unlimited quantities, at the current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 percent off season. Quotas on orange juice will also be phased out. The United States also demanded and got compensation on tariffs for other &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; products in return for concessions on allowing Japan to slowly phase out its tariffs. Included were liberalized restrictions on &lt;b&gt; imports &lt;/b&gt; of grapefruit, lemons, frozen peaches and pears, pistachios, macadamias, pecans, walnuts, pet food, beef jerky, sausage and pork and beans. As part of the agreement, the United States agreed to withdraw a complaint filed with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; body that oversees &lt;b&gt; international &lt;/b&gt; trade. The two sides agreed to further discuss Japan\\'s emergency import curbs during the current round of &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; under GATT. The temporary &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; was signed by Yeutter and Takashi Sato, Japan\\'s agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. Yeutter said the official documents would be signed in Washington, hopefully in the next few weeks, after the United States gathers the documents it needs. Cabinet Secretary Minister Keizo Obuchi welcomed the agreement, telling a regular news conference Monday that ``it reconfirms that the United States and Japan are able to solve their problems through joint efforts.\\'\\' He said the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; can be fully implemented without hurting Japanese farmers. Yeutter said the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; ``will require some creative and innovative thinking\\'\\' on the part of Japanese officials in helping Japanese farmers adjust. However, he said Japanese consumers will benefit through an increased standard of living and cheaper prices, while Japan\\'s economy will benefit through increased competition. He said the United States will be closely watching Japan to make sure the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; is put into effect. A similar pact on computer chips came under attack last year after the United States accused Japan of circumventing the spirit of the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; by selling computer chips at unfairly low prices through third countries. That battle is still being fought through GATT. Yeutter said that ``it would be unfortunate if government agencies were to attempt to circumvent the spirit of this agreement.\\'\\' Yeutter also said the United States has no plans at this time to expand its demands to include the liberalization of rice, another thorny issue in Japan-U.S. relations. However, he said he could not rule out that possibility in the future if the United States is provoked. While agreeing to eliminate the beef import restrictions, Japan retained the right to raise the tariffs temporarily by 25 percent if beef &lt;b&gt; imports &lt;/b&gt; exceed the previous year\\'s level by 20 percent. After the transitional period ending in 1993, Japan\\'s beef tariffs will be subject to discussions in the GATT. Sato, the agriculture minister, said the Japanese government will soon begin negotiations with Australia, another major beef exporter, on the Japanese import restrictions. Associations of Japanese orange growers and cattle farmers criticized the agreement. ``As producers who had been closely following the course of negotiations, we can\\'t help but keenly feel regret and anger,\\'\\' Mitsugu Horiuchi, president of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; 0.519057517264268  \\n   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga says a free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; between his country and the United States is being considered more seriously because recent successes in resolving &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; disputes have improved relations between the two nations. It is time to ``build our partnership on the basis of our interlocking strengths instead of constantly warring over our separate weaknesses,\\'\\' Matsunaga told the Washington Council on International Trade last week. The ambassador said that the much-discussed U.S. &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; deficit and the corresponding Japanese &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; surplus ``simply do not comprehend\\'\\' the scope and complexity of the &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; and political relationships between the two countries. ``It is quite understandable, therefore, that thoughtful people on both sides of the Pacific are now considering the possible benefits of some form of free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; arrangement between the United States and Japan, the two largest and most dynamic economies in the world, whose two-way &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; is exceeded in value only by America\\'s &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; with Canada...\\'\\' Matsunaga said in his Thursday address. A U.S.-Japan free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; _ which essentially would remove &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers between the two &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; _ was proposed first in 1981 by Mike Mansfield, U.S. ambassador to Japan. The initial reaction was widespread skepticism that two &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; with such different cultures and legal systems could fashion a workable agreement. But earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd raised the issue with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. And Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and now Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to prepare a report listing the pros and cons of such an agreement. The interest is driven not only by the increasingly complex &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relationship between the two countries, but by concerns by both about their &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relations with other nations. Japan has concerns about how the U.S.-Canada free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; may affect its own &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; with the United States and Canada. And both &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; are concerned that the lowering of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers among European Community nations, scheduled for 1992, could lead to increased difficulty in gaining access to that market. David Rohr, a member of the federal International Trade Commission who recently visited Japan to gather opinions for the study requested by Bentsen, said the Japanese are ``really scared\\'\\' of the sweeping U.S. &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; bill _ signed into law last week and criticized by Matsunaga as ``disproportionately protectionist\\'\\' _ because of its sanctions for unfair &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; practices. &lt;/p&gt; 0.4786823304804  \\n   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today opened the most ambitious &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; negotiations ever undertaken, urging officials of 90 &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; to compromise to resolve &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; differences. In an apparent reference to a clash between the United States and its allies on &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; subsidies, Mulroney exhorted the delegates to ``be motivated by a spirit of honorable compromise.\\'\\' Mulroney said farmers around the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; ``are looking for results in Montreal. They can no longer survive on a diet of promises.\\'\\' The round of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; negotiations is designed to liberalize and broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an &lt;b&gt; international &lt;/b&gt; trade-policing treaty signed in 1947. GATT now has 96 members, and 90 &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; ministers were at today\\'s meeting. The U.S. delegation has come under strong criticism from Japan, Australia and the European Community over its demand to completely eliminate government supports for farmers. The 12-nation European Community is only willing to reduce them, terming the U.S. position unrealistic. Mulroney urged the negotiators to ``be animated by a spirit of realism,\\'\\' echoing similar weekend calls to the United States in preparatory consultations for the mid-term review of the four-year Uruguay Round of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; talks. The United States was further isolated by a tentative accord reached between the Europeans and developing &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; that would remove or reduce tariffs on the export of tropical products to the industrialized world. An EC spokeswoman said the United States did not yet support the agreement, which would affect $70 billion in internaional &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; of such products as jute, bananas and coffee. Michael Duffy, Australia\\'s Minister of Trade Negotiations, told reporters Sunday that blame for U.S.-European impasse over &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers should be shared by the two parties. But he and other officials looked to the Americans to make the first move. Duffy warned that if neither side compromises during the three-day talks, ``it will sour the rest of the round,\\'\\' which ends in 1990. The dispute over agricultural subsidies has clouded prospects for progress on other urgent &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; problems, such as the inclusion of the booming services &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; in the 40-year-old GATT pact and the adoption of safeguards for copyrights and patents. ``It\\'s hard to see how there can be progress in other areas without progress in agriculture,\\'\\' said John Crosbie, Canada\\'s Minister for International Trade. The United States took a conciliatory stand but insisted it would stick to its main objective. Chief agriculture negotiator Dan Amstutz noted the United States had moved away from setting a 2000 deadline for elimination of subsidies and agreed to emergency government food stockpiles as long as they are bought on the open market. ``We\\'re flexible,\\'\\' he said, but ``we\\'d rather not have any &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; than a bad one.\\'\\' The U.S. delegation also appeared to hold out the possibility it would relent on its rejection of a proposal lifting barriers on the export of tropical products, such as bananas and coconuts, by developing nations. U.S. &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; negotiator Alan Holmer warned that failure by the GATT round could create ``uncertainties\\'\\' in Congress and within the incoming administration of George Bush. He did not elaborate. But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said failure on the &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; support issue would result in an ``export-oriented\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; bill. Congress is scheduled to draft a &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; bill next year and Leahy indicated it would include supports for farmers so they can compete effectively against farmers whose governments also subsidize exports. The United States projects that its 1989 &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; supports will amount to $13 billion _ down from the $27 million of 1987 but still a heavy burden on the deficit-ridden budget. U.S. officials say Europeans could save about $200 billion every year if they stopped their &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; supports. But the EC, under the influence of powerful &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; lobbies, says eliminating supports is not a viable option. &lt;/p&gt; 0.461372217496813  \\n   The United States would be happy to consider negotiating a free-trade &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; with Japan along the lines of the treaty reached with Canada, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said Friday. While there are no current discussion about such a treaty, it would fit into this country\\'s overall strategy to break down &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers wherever they exist, he said. ``We have a major trading relationship with Japan,\\'\\' Baker said. ``It (a free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; agreement) would be something that the United States would be pleased to consider if it were something that the government of Japan wanted to consider.\\'\\' Baker\\'s comments came in a television interview with &lt;b&gt; foreign &lt;/b&gt; journalists for broadcast outside the United States by the U.S. Information Agency. The session was a preview of the seven-nation &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; summit opening Sunday in Toronto. President Reagan, addressing the annual conference of the USIA International Council, meantime, reiterated his belief in free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; while saying &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers of other &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; are generating protectionist pressures in America. ``It damages the entire &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; economy when &lt;b&gt; foreign &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; fail to offer the same opportunity to American exports that America offers to their products,\\'\\' Reagan said. ``It is this basic sense of fairness that has helped generate protectionist pressures in America. Let me repeat protectionism, the closing of America\\'s markets, is the wrong response; opening markets, that, I firmly believe, is the answer.\\'\\' Meanwhile, there appeared to be movement on another contentious &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; dispute between Japan and the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Friday that he was leaving immediately for Japan, saying a deal may be near on ending that nation\\'s restrictions on beef imports. ``We certainly have not yet reached an agreement, but I\\'m persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a trip,\\'\\' Yeutter said. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We remain hopeful,\\'\\' but added, ``Until there\\'s a deal, there\\'s no deal.\\'\\' The Agriculture Department has placed the overall value of the Japanese beef market at $2 billion. A U.S.-Japan free-trade &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; would presumably be of substantial benefit to this country because U.S. officials for years have pressured the Japanese to open their markets to American products as a way of reducing the huge &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; imbalance between the two nations. The Japanese ran up a &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; surplus with the United States last year of $59.8 billion, more than one-third of this country\\'s America\\'s overall &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; deficit of $170.3 billion. The U.S.-Canada pact now being considered by Congress and the Canadian Parliament would end all &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers within 10 years. Some critics have charged that specific &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; pacts such as the U.S.-Canada &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; or the plan to eliminate all barriers between the 12-nation European Economic Community by 1992 pose risks of returning the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; to the &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; cartels of the 1930s, which worked to shrink &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; rather than expanding it. But Baker disputed this, saying the United States saw any &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; liberalization agreements as beneficial. He said America preferred to pursue reduction of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers through the discussions being held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But he hinted that if those &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; did not reach a successful conclusion, the United States would look to &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; pacts with smaller groups of countries. Baker said the summit between President Reagan and other Western leaders would include a full-fledged discussion of Reagan\\'s proposal to eliminate all &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; subsidies by the year 2000. These subsidies are costing the major industrial &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; $150 billion annually in higher government support payments and increased food costs to consumers. He acknowledged that the U.S. proposal to eliminate subsidies was facing intense opposition, with Washington hoping basically for a reiteration in Toronto of a pledge the industrialized &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; made last month in Paris to press forward in negotiations on the issue. The U.S. delegation, led by Baker, had pressed for more specific language to adopt Reagan\\'s call for a subsidy-free &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; in agricultural &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; by a specific date. But Baker contended Friday that progress had been made in Paris. ``The fact that we are even discussing this very difficult problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress,\\'\\' he said. ``It is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all able to go to our farmers and say the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; is going to do this.\\'\\' European &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; have argued that it is politically impossible to eliminate all &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; subsidies and a proper compromise would be to reduce them, perhaps by cutting them in half. The United States is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a Montreal &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; meeting in December. The Montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current round of global &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; which were launched in 1986 in Uruguay and scheduled to end in 1990. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  south africa black african mandela apartheid government anc national klerk white blacks congress sanctions release anti-apartheid end leaders question racial &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.506518336418872  \\n   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha apologized on behalf of the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday for a police search of the West German consul\\'s home, but also criticized West Germany\\'s policies. Police searched the home of Erhard Loeser, West Germany\\'s acting consul-general, on Monday. They were looking for Heinrich Grosskopf, a 24-year-old &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; South African accused of a car-bombing last week that killed three people. Officials claim Grosskopf carried out that bombing and at least one other on orders from the outlawed African National Congress, the predominantly &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; guerrilla group fighting to &lt;b&gt; end &lt;/b&gt; domination by South Africa\\'s &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; minority. Botha gave no reason why police decided to search Loeser\\'s home and coupled his apology with an attack on Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany for suggesting a boycott of South African products as a means of protesting the &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; policy. He said the suggestion was ``callously irresponsible\\'\\' and a boycott would ``deprive people of their livelihood.\\'\\' The foreign minister also criticized Genscher for questioning the fairness of legal proceedings for the ``Sharpeville Six,\\'\\' a group of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; granted a one-month stay of execution last week. They were convicted of complicity in the mob killing of a &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; official. By law and custom, &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; establishes a racially segregated society in which South Africa\\'s 26 million &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; have no vote in &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. &lt;/p&gt; 0.489276487407147  \\n   The African National Congress recommended Monday that Nelson Mandela meet rival &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a breakthrough that could help ease the violence in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; townships. The ANC proposed a meeting between itself and Buthelezi\\'s conservative Inkatha Freedom Party ``in the near future,\\'\\' but did not specify a date. The ANC statement said both Mandela and Buthelezi should attend. Buthelezi said he welcomed the offer and was ready to consider a suitable time and place for the talks. Mandela is in Australia and will be traveling throughout Asia until early November. Since his &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; from prison in February, Mandela has turned down invitations from his old friend Buthelezi despite the ongoing violence between their supporters in the eastern province of Natal and in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; areas outside Johannesburg. ANC &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; have harshly briticized Buthelezi and accused him of orchestrating the violence to obtain a meeting with Mandela and enhance his stature. Buthelezi has denied the charge and accused the ANC of trying to destroy all rivals. The ANC was conciliatory in its statement Monday. The group said ``it welcomed the steps being taken jointly by the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party\\'\\' to stop the violence. The two sides have been holding periodic peace talks, but neither Mandela nor Buthelezi has attended. About 5,000 &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; have died in the ANC-Inkatha power struggle since 1986 in Natal Province. The fighting spread to the Johannesburg area in August and has claimed 800 lives. The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; opposition movements, both oppose &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; but differ over tactics and a future South Africa. The socialist-oriented ANC has employed boycotts, strikes, protests and waged an armed struggle, recently suspended, in its battle against the government. Inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors capitalism. The ANC draws support across tribal lines, while virtually all Inkatha members are Zulus. The ANC also has opposed Buthelezi\\'s role as leader of the KwaZulu homeland in Natal Province. The ANC considers the 10 &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; homelands part of the &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; system. Buthelezi, meanwhile, sees the limited self-government in the homelands as an interim step on the road to &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; majority rule. &lt;/p&gt; 0.465480196432289  \\n   Alan Paton, the country\\'s best known author, was recovering today from surgery for an undisclosed ailment, a press report said. Paton, whose 1948 novel ``Cry, The Beloved Country\\'\\' drew a compelling picture of South Africa\\'s &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; system of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; segregation, was in ``fairly serious condition\\'\\' after Tuesday\\'s operation, according to an unidentified heart surgeon quoted by the South African Press Association. A spokeswoman at St. Augustine\\'s Hospital in Durban said today that Paton was in stable condition. The 85-year-old novelist underwent surgery after being admitted to the Durban hospital Monday, the news agency said. Paton\\'s ``Cry, The Beloved Country\\'\\' is the second best-selling book ever in South Africa after the Bible. Paton worked in &lt;b&gt; anti-apartheid &lt;/b&gt; politics for many years with the United Party and still contributes political commentary to South African newspapers.

Botha, who represented President F. W. de Klerk, addressed the heads of state as ``my African brothers\\'\\' during the informal meeting, which was punctuated by joking and laughter. The breakfast host was Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, head of the seven-nation Frontline States, a regional bloc that once led efforts to &lt;b&gt; end &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; in South Africa. The other two &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; were President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who maintains close contacts with South Africa, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, the current chairman of the 51-member Organization of African unity. President Bush sent a congratulatory message, saying the meeting ``marks a new era in Africa.\\'\\' The get-together over eggs, bacon and croissants signaled a further easing of tensions between white-led South Africa and its &lt;b&gt; anti-apartheid &lt;/b&gt; neighbors. Zambian officials said it was made possible by de Klerk\\'s recent steps toward dismantling apartheid, including legalizing the African National Congress, freeing political prisoners including the ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and lifting the state of emergency in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; townships. The ANC, outlawed for 30 years in South Africa, had its headquarters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka until early this year. Kaunda, once one of the most vocal African critics of apartheid, said the theme of the meeting was ``peace, unity and reconciliation.\\'\\' Botha told the &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; African &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; that South Africa could help economic development in the largely impoverished region, adding: ``We in Africa must join hands and move closer together.\\'\\' ``South Africa must play its rightful role in southern Africa and we are ready to play that role,\\'\\' Botha said. Ugandan President Museveni said he got the idea for such a meeting from a prayer breakfast he attended with U.S. congressmen two years ago. He wanted to organize something similar, he said, but as he was not a good Christian he asked Kaunda to be host. Three other African heads of state, Quett Masire of Botswana, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and Metsing Lekhanya of Lesotho, were invited but did not attend. &lt;/p&gt; 0.443119008127283  \\n   Zulus fired assault rifles at Xhosas sleeping in a workers barracks early Monday, leaving 22 people dead and pushing the death toll to 364 in a week of tribal clashes, police said. Zulus and Xhosas, the country\\'s two largest &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; tribes and longtime rivals, have been waging vicious battles since Aug. 12 in the townships surrounding Johannesburg. Police and eyewitnesses said Zulus armed with AK-47 rifles raided a Xhosa workers hostel early Monday in KwaThema township east of Johannesburg. At least 22 people were killed, many of them Xhosas shot in their beds, they said. Police in armored vehicles moved in after dawn to restore order. Enraged Xhosas set fire to a hostel used by Zulus before being driven off. Fighting also flared in nearby townships, resulting in several deaths. Looters continued to pillage hostels abandoned by Zulu migrant workers. People carted away refrigerators, stoves and anything else they could find. Johannesburg newspapers Monday reported five killings Sunday in the Soweto township by the ``necklace\\'\\' method, whereby youths put gasoline-soaked tires around the necks of victims and set them alight. Police on Monday raised the death toll for the fighting from the past week to 364 and said hundreds were injured. ``We just keep finding bodies. They\\'re everywhere,\\'\\' said a police spokesman. The fighting appears to be mostly a tribal conflict with a long history, but it also has political overtones. Nelson Mandela and many other &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; of the African National Congress, the largest opposition movement, are Xhosas. The ANC\\'s rival, Inkatha, is a Zulu-based organization headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, the system of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and economic control over 30 million blacks. But the two groups differ over tactics and plans for a future South Africa. ANC leader Walter Sisulu ruled out peace talks between Mandela and Buthelezi, saying it would be a capitulation. ``That means Inkatha launches a war in order to bring us to our knees. For that type of thing we are not prepared,\\'\\' he said in a weekend television interview. Mandela\\'s wife, Winnie, warned the ANC may be forced to resume its armed struggle to protect is supporters. The ANC agreed Aug. 6 to suspend it largely ineffective guerrilla campaign. Mrs. Mandela accused the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; of ``working hand-in-hand\\'\\' with the relatively conservative Inkatha movement in the fighting against Xhosas, the independent South African Press Association reported. Also, the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; has revoked immunity from prosecution for three ANC leaders, including the head of the group\\'s military wing, Chris Hani. The three men, Hani, Ronnie Kasrils and Mac Maharaj, also are members of the South African Communist Party, a close ANC ally. The &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; gave no reason for the decision. But it was seen as a signal that authorities are upset with militant statements made recently by some ANC leaders. The trio are among more than 40 ANC &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; granted temporary immunity three months ago so they could participate in peace talks. All but Hani, Kasrils and Maharaj have had their immunity extended until the &lt;b&gt; end &lt;/b&gt; of the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  bill house senate committee sen rep congress legislation chairman measure vote year lawmakers congressional members subcommittee republican proposal leader approved &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.48489727105023  \\n   The House on Thursday rejected a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from desecration, heeding opponents who said it would risk damage to the Bill of Rights. The 254-177 tally left the amendment, which was supported by President Bush, 34 votes short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Republicans voted 159-17 for it, Democrats 160-95 against. The &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; followed a sometimes impassioned day of debate featuring more than 100 speeches, including a rare address by the speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``We should not amend the Constitution of the United States to reach the sparse and scattered and despicable conduct of a few who would dishonor the flag and defile it,\\'\\' said Foley, who also cast a rare speaker\\'s &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; to register his opposition to the amendment. By tradition, the speaker does not normally engage in debate or vote. Countered Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``Let us take the flag out of the gutter where the counterculture has dragged it and is smearing it. We have 10 amendments that guarantee us all sorts of rights. How about one amendment that gives us a duty?\\'\\' Foley told reporters that Thursday\\'s &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; would be the last one on the amendment this &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; in the House, but Republicans promised to keep the issue alive. ``I am confident this debate is going to go on for a long time,\\'\\' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told the chamber. Asked about the Bush\\'s efforts on behalf of the amendment, Gingrich said ``it was very hard for the president in two days to override the speaker.\\'\\' Supporters of the amendment, backed by veterans\\' groups seeking more time to lobby, had tried to delay Thursday\\'s &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; until next week but were defeated 231-192. Rep. Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., the &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the House Veterans Committee and the amendment\\'s prime Democratic sponsor, said of the proposal, ``I think we owe it to the brave Americans who have died for this country.\\'\\' But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., decried the attempt to modify the First Amendment. ``When I look around the politicians today, I see more people who remind me of Daffy Duck than Thomas Jefferson,\\'\\' he said. The strength of the opposition was larger than expected and was aided by the unexpected support of some conservatives. ``Up until 24 hours ago, I was a sponsor of this amendment,\\'\\' said Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C. ``But over the rhetoric of the past few days, I finally heard the voice of my own conscience.\\'\\' The amendment read, ``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\\'\\' It was first proposed in 1989 after the Supreme Court ruled that flag burning was a form of protected free speech. The issue was revived last week when the court rejected last year\\'s attempt to pass an anti-flag-burning law that the court could accept. After the &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; on the amendment, the House also rejected a new statute _ not a constitutional amendment _ to ban flag burning. The bill, narrowly drawn in hopes of avoiding court rejection, would impose fines and jail terms for people who burn flags to promote violence or who burn flags on federal property or belonging to the federal government. Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after their leadership called it a ``fig leaf\\'\\' to protect Democrats who opposed the constitutional amendment, and it lost 236-179. The Senate is expected to &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; next week on the amendment, which would require a two-thirds &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; in both chambers, and approval by 38 of the 50 states, for ratification. Foley said the House would not &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; again this year. Regardless of the outcome on Capitol Hill, Republicans promise to raise the issue in this fall\\'s campaign. The House majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., acknowledged the political tightrope &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; were walking. Several &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; decorated their speeches with flags and other props. Rep. Gary Ackerman, trying to highlight the difficulty of enforcing &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; to protect the flag, held aloft a wide variety of household items and gags decorated with the stars and stripes. ``How about American flag napkins,\\'\\' he said, holding one. ``What if you blow your nose in one. Have you broken the law?\\'\\' Although Ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the debate, Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he was offended. Most Republican speakers supported the amendment; the bulk of opposition came from Democrats. There also was a noticeable generational tilt in the debate. House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., a decorated World War II veteran, co-sponsored the amendment and called it ``a measured, prudent, limited thoughtful approach to the problem.\\'\\' ``Surely this is something different from the `assault on the Bill of Rights\\' some critics say it is,\\'\\' he said. Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., another World War II vet, used photographs of the famed Iwo Jima flag raising and of a flag-burning protest in New York\\'s Central Park to dramatize his support for the amendment. But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a Vietnam veteran who said he would ``never forget the sacrifices that have been made so that our flag can fly proudly and freely,\\'\\' was a &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; of the opposition. ``In 200 years of our history, these basic freedoms have never been amended, never. And if we start now, who knows what freedoms will be next? ... Where will it end?\\'\\' he asked. &lt;/p&gt; 0.457894118691134  \\n   In an election-year bow to an agency that serves one-third of all Americans, the Senate voted Tuesday to give the Veterans Administration a seat in the president\\'s Cabinet. The &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; was passed by an 84-11 vote. The House &lt;b&gt; approved &lt;/b&gt; similar &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; last November, a week after the idea was advanced by President Reagan. Negotiators from the the Senate and House will work out minor differences between the two bills. The Department of Veterans\\' Affairs would become the 14th in the Cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 1989. Sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard in the highest councils of government. Opponents called the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; another example of &lt;b&gt; congressional &lt;/b&gt; pandering to special interests. ``In recent years the VA has frequently been relegated to a relatively insignificant role within the executive branch, with the administrator having little or no access to the president or other top officials in the White House,\\'\\' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the Senate Veterans\\' Affairs Committee. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who has been promoting a veterans\\' department since 1975, said his support is not aimed at getting more money for veterans. ``Given the nature and scope of the VA, it is appropriate that we make it an executive department ... (to) ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively administered.\\'\\' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., a former Veterans Committee chairman, opposed creation of the Cabinet seat. He bitterly criticized some veterans\\' service organizations for supporting the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; while they fought another measure, passed Monday by the Senate, that would allow courts to overturn some VA decisions on veterans\\' benefits. ``If anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice ... than they already have, then I\\'ve missed something in the nine years I\\'ve been year,\\'\\' Simpson said. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; ``absurd... silly... goofy... illogical ... irresponsible. This is rubbish. This is unprincipled (prostitution) after special-interest groups.\\'\\' According to the Veterans\\' Affairs Committee, VA serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of $30 billion, making it the largest independent federal agency. It will dispense $14 billion in income maintenance and $626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that converting the VA into a Cabinet department would cost $33 million over five years. The biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on VA buildings. The &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; would reorganize VA operations and allow the secretary of veterans\\' affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and 15 deputy assistants. The &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; requires that the top operating officers _ the chief medical director and chief benefits director _ be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard to politics. Voting against elevating VA to the Cabinet were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Humphrey; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; James McClure, R-Idaho; William Proxmire, D-Wis.; Dan Quayle, R-Ind.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Simpson, and Steven Symms, R-Idaho. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Paul Trible, R-Va., and John Warner, R-Va. &lt;/p&gt; 0.404044827963029  \\n   Special interests paid nearly $600,000 last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; for speeches by a half-dozen top leaders in the House. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the tax-writing committee, took in the most with $285,000, according to financial disclosure reports made public Tuesday. Rank-and-file &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; shared in the speechmaking windfall to supplement their $89,500 salaries. All told, House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; accepted millions of dollars for speaking and writing, and many got more for talking than the average family earns in a year. The flow of speaking fees, mostly from special interests that ranged from colleges to banks, was hardly slowed by the allegations of financial improprieties that led last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; to the resignations of Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the majority whip. Wright\\'s successor, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported he received $32,000 in honoraria. Coelho\\'s successor, Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., claimed $164,098. Foley\\'s successor as majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., reported $34,500. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., was the top talk-for-pay lawmaker outside the leadership, with $160,517. House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; are allowed to keep honoraria equivalent to 30 percent of their salaries and most give what is left to charity. Rostenkowski traditionally spreads the excess among churches and schools in his hometown of Chicago. Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia handed over $29,304 of his $67,491 in fees to the Atlanta zoo. The disclosure statements of most House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; were made public Tuesday, although some &lt;b&gt; lawmakers &lt;/b&gt; were granted extensions. Senators\\' reports will be released Wednesday. Speaking and writing fees were not the only source of outside income for &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of the House, which has dozens of millionaires. One of the wealthiest, Rep. Amory Houghton, R-N.Y., an heir to the Corning Glass Works fortune, received $127,000 last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; for managing family trusts. Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., listed dividends of $5,000 to $15,000 from his stake in a popular barbecue restaurant, Red, Hot `n Blue, in Arlington, Va. Rep. Ronald Machtley, R-R.I., earned interest by lending money to his own campaign committee. Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, pocketed a $24,000 salary from his law firm, $11,913 in Social Security benefits and as much as $15,000 from his stake in a thoroughbred horse breeding operation. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is under investigation by the House ethics &lt;b&gt; committee &lt;/b&gt; because of his association with a male prostitute, was paid between $15,000 and $50,000 as an advance on a book he is writing. Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., an actor who played on the old ``Dukes of Hazzard\\'\\' show, received a $10,625 advance for his autobiography. Another ex-actor, Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, earned $26,219 in royalties from his tour on the ``Love Boat\\'\\' series. Rep. J. Howard Coble, R-N.C., won $600 in a &lt;b&gt; congressional &lt;/b&gt; pinball tournament and donated it to charities in his district. Rep. Curtis Weldon, R-Pa., who once helped extinguish a fire in a House office building, was reimbursed for expenses of 19 speaking trips to fire-fighting organizations in 16 states last year. He received no fees for those speeches. Weldon is a founder of the &lt;b&gt; congressional &lt;/b&gt; fire-prevention caucus. Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., earned $17,307 as &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the Massachusetts State Democratic Committee. Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., sold a 1948 Chrysler roadster for something between $15,000 and $50,000. Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., earned nearly $14,000 designing Indian jewelry. Rep. Herbert Callahan, D-Ala., was paid $12,000 in director\\'s fees from the Finch Companies. Although Democrats, who control the House, were paid the most for their speechmaking, Republicans shared in the wealth. Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois reported $49,300. Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, who heads the House Republican Conference, was paid $31,000. As part of a &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; raising their government salaries, House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; agreed that 1990 will be the last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; they will receive honoraria. Senators will allow themselves lower government salaries than House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; after this &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; but will keep their speaking fees. In addition to their speaking fees and other honoraria, &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of Congress and most other federal officials are required to disclose their assets, not including their homes; their investments, most liabilities and gifts. The forms require that values be listed only by broad category. For example, a multimillion-dollar holding is reported only as worth more than $250,000. Some &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; are more precise. Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., whose seniority and Appropriations Committee position make him one of the most powerful House members, listed no speaking fees, no gifts, no liabilities, no investment transactions and no membership in any organization. He listed nine properties valued at $144,978 from which he collected $4,200 in rent, and the $4,131 savings account that earned $212 interest. Not all are so lucky in their finances. Rep. Tommy F. Robinson, R-Ark., who switched parties last year, listed among his liabilities more than $250,000 he owes Jerral W. Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Jones\\' daughter left a $60,000-a-year job on Robinson\\'s staff last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; after the congressman and Jones had a falling out over Robinson\\'s plans to run for governor. Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., reported assets of between zero and $5,000 with no liabilities. On the other hand, Gephardt, who sold rental homes in Missouri last year, had no liabilities but assets of as much as $915,000. Rep. William Green, R-N.Y., an heir to the Grand Union food stores, reported one of the highest 1989 incomes among House members, at least $507,857 and perhaps as much as $1.26 million. His campaign &lt;b&gt; committee &lt;/b&gt; returned to him between $100,000 and $250,000 of personal funds he had invested in his 1984 re-election effort. &lt;/p&gt; 0.385928898412753  \\n   The Senate passed &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; today that would permit the death penalty for drug dealers convicted of murder, rejecting pleas that the &lt;b&gt; measure &lt;/b&gt; would be a move toward ``reducing the civility\\'\\' of society. The election-year &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; was sent to the House on a 65-29 vote. The bill\\'s fate is less certain in that chamber, where the House Judiciary Committee _ which will consider it _ has been hostile to capital punishment &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; in the past. ``Murder is murder, whether legal or illegal,\\'\\' said Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash. ``We are reducing the civility and the compassion of our society.\\'\\' But Sen. Alfonse D\\'Amato, R-N.Y., the bill\\'s sponsor, said, ``I believe society has a right to say we are outraged at certain acts, and the death penalty is the appropriate penalty in these cases.\\'\\' Before final passage, &lt;b&gt; lawmakers &lt;/b&gt; voted 66-28 to set aside a provision by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., that would have limited the bill\\'s capital punishment provisions to drug dealers who are convicted of killing law enforcement officers. On voice votes, they accepted a provision that would allow prison employees to refuse to participate in executions, and rejected language that would have required prisoners to be killed in public. Both measures were sponsored by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore. On Thursday, the Senate voted 69-27 to shut off debate, ending a filibuster by opponents who had stalled a vote. ``I\\'m not saying the death penalty will eliminate the drug problem, but I do think it will serve as a deterrent,\\'\\' said D\\'Amato. But opponents decried the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; as election-year politics, saying it would do nothing to deter drug dealing and represented a cynical response to public demands to do something about illegal drugs. Evans referred to a similar &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; proposed in 1986 and said: ``Once again, we\\'re going for an election-year slam dunk on drugs. ... We\\'re taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political vanity.\\'\\' The D\\'Amato &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; provides that the death penalty can be imposed on people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring and who are then separately convicted of killing law enforcement officers or private citizens. Many states, including those with severe drug problems, already have the death penalty and it hasn\\'t had much deterrent effect, opponents of the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; said. Before invoking cloture, the Senate voted 65-31 against an amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment without parole, instead of the death penalty, for people convicted under the terms of D\\'Amato\\'s bill. D\\'Amato\\'s &lt;b&gt; proposal &lt;/b&gt; was originally attached as an amendment to the Pentagon budget bill, but opponents filibustered and D\\'Amato withdrew his &lt;b&gt; proposal &lt;/b&gt; in return for a promise by Senate leaders to give him a &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; on a separate bill. Supporters said the death penalty would deter drug kingpins. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said, ``To go on talking about a war on drugs and not commit ourselves to a death penalty for those who kill our law enforcement officers in that war is to make a mockery of saying we have a war on drugs.\\'\\' But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said, ``The evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent is just not there at all.\\'\\' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., added that the death penalty provision could lead to the execution of innocent people. He cited a Stanford University study which said 350 people have been convicted of capital offenses in this century and then later found to be innocent. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, responded that there are enough safeguards in the legal system to protect innocent persons. ``Nobody should be able to kill our policemen without paying the ultimate price,\\'\\' he said. Also Thursday, the House Banking Committee &lt;b&gt; approved &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; to make it more difficult for drug dealers and other criminals to hide their profits. The &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; would require banks to file transaction reports with the government for all cashiers\\' checks, money orders and travelers\\' checks of $3,000 or more. Now, banks need to file such reports on transactions of $10,000 or more. New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, meanwhile, was proposing the creation of ``tent jails\\'\\' in Nevada to incarcerate convicted drug offenders and relieve prison overcrowding elsewhere. In an appearance before two House Armed Services subcommittees, Koch conceded that Nevada probably wouldn\\'t think much of his idea. &lt;/p&gt; 0.371477202794283  \\n   The &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says presidents should be sworn in earlier because the 2{ months between Election Day and Inauguration Day creates an unnecessary ``period of vulnerability.\\'\\' ``The incumbent president no longer has real political authority and the incoming president lacks constitutional authority, and the whole world knows it,\\'\\' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Friday. ``It is a period of vulnerability which can and should be eliminated.\\'\\' In a Senate floor speech introducing a resolution for a constitutional amendment, Pell said the change would eliminate ``10 weeks of crippled leadership\\'\\' and avoid an ``unhealthy and unnecessary situation.\\'\\' The senator wants to move up Inauguration Day for the president and vice president from Jan. 20 to Nov. 20. The constitutional amendment also would move the swearing-in day for Congress from Jan. 3 to Nov. 15. Pell has introduced similar measures in the past. With time quickly running out in this session of Congress, action this &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; appears unlikely. From 1793 to 1933, the swearing in of new presidents took place March 4. The 20th Amendment pushed it back to Jan. 20 beginning in 1937. Pell, who introduced the resolution along with Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., said the move also would avoid `@lame duck\\'\\' administrations in which officials might be ``tempted to expend funds, make contracts and grants and promulgate regulations that may be either politically motivated or inspired by sheer self-interest.\\'\\' Pell said the development of voting machines and instant election result tabulations eliminates the justification for the long lag time between elections and inaugurations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  stores store sales food market customers nordstrom goods consumers christmas shopping retail clothing chain bread prices video employees buying department &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.409647116339293  \\n   America\\'s No. 1 &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; is swallowing No. 3 in a $40 million deal that gives Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. a total of more than 1,700 stores. Blockbuster agreed to acquire Erol\\'s Inc. of Springfield, Va., a &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; of 208 outlets that pioneered the &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; rental business in 1980 but has struggled amid management shuffles and stiff competition. The deal ``provides an outstanding opportunity for Blockbuster and its franchise owners to broaden the base of ourstores,\\'\\' Blockbuster chairman and chief executive officer H. Wayne Huizenga said Monday. Erol\\'s, the nation\\'s third-largest &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; behind West Coast-National of Philadelphia, has &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland and Chicago as well as 112 &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in the Washington, D.C., area, where Blockbuster has only 48 outlets and was looking to expand. Blockbuster, based in Fort Lauderdale, opened its 1,500th &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; Monday, in Vancouver, British Columbia. In all, the &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; has &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Canada and England. Erol\\'s founder and principal stockholder, Erol Onaran, said the buyout was in the best interest of his 2,600 employees. ``It was going to be a fight,\\'\\' said analyst Drew Beja at Advest Securities. ``And Blockbuster had the resources to win the fight.\\'\\' Onaron founded Erol\\'s as a stereo repair shop in Washington in 1963. It was an early pioneer in the &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; industry, opening &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; exclusively devoted to rentals in 1980, and led all other &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; chains in revenue until Blockbuster surpassed it in 1988. But Erol\\'s has been stagnating since then, and didn\\'t begin to sell franchises until last August, said Frank Molstad, editor of Video Store magazine. In contrast, Blockbuster has been expanding by 400 to 500 &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; a year since Huizenga bought the company in 1987 for $19 million, and Huizenga has said &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; this year could top $1 billion. Erol\\'s had revenue of $100 million last year, said Jerry Falkner, an analyst at Southwest Research Partners in Boca Raton. While more than 1,700 &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; by the end of the year, Blockbuster will still have only about 10 percent of the home &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; market, said Fran Blechman Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt; 0.400430825039905  \\n   Hopes for a successful Christmas &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; season all but vanished after the nation\\'s biggest retailers said their business continued to deteriorate in October. Several companies including Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported Thursday that their &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped from levels of a year earlier as consumers, preoccupied with concerns about the economy and the Middle East, avoided &lt;b&gt; buying &lt;/b&gt; anything they didn\\'t need. The disappointing October &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; followed poor showings in August and September, and with Christmas less than seven weeks away, retailers and the industry analysts who track their performance expect &lt;b&gt; consumers &lt;/b&gt; to remain frugal during the holiday season. ``They\\'ll probaby be going in and &lt;b&gt; buying &lt;/b&gt; the same number of items, but they\\'re not going to pay as much ...\\'\\' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. ``They\\'re not going to buy $100 electronic toys for their kids, not this year.\\'\\' Analysts said shoppers will be looking harder for bargains and waiting longer for price reductions than in past years. ``They\\'re going to be busy spending fewer dollars,\\'\\' said Daniel Barry, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. Consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait raised the specter of war, inflating &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; of gasoline and home heating oil. The first items crossed off &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; lists were so-called discretionary items - clothing, furniture, home appliances and other extras that are the &lt;b&gt; bread &lt;/b&gt; and butter of many big stores. If retailers have a difficult Christmas, it could contribute to a further deterioration of the economy, since two-thirds of the nation\\'s economic growth is generated by consumer spending. Unsold &lt;b&gt; goods &lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; shelves could also affect manufacturing - if &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; don\\'t place new orders, factories don\\'t need to provide as many products and could lay off workers. And a poor Christmas season could be devastating for the retailers themselves, as they depend on holiday &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; for about half their annual &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; and profits. Christmas 1989 was a disappointment for many storeowners after they were forced to slash &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; to attract customers. Sears, the country\\'s largest retailer, said October results from &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; open at least one year fell 0.4 percent from a year earlier, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 1.2 percent. Analysts believe &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; open at least a year - also known as same-store or comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; - provide a more accurate assessment of a retailer\\'s performance than overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; do. New &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; tend to have extraordinarily strong &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; that can skew a retailer\\'s results. One of the hardest hit last month was Penney, which said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; fell 6.3 percent from October 1989, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 4.9 percent. Limited Inc., the nation\\'s largest specialty apparel retailer, reported comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 1 percent as overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 13 percent. Apparel &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; were also affected by continuing warm weather in some parts of the country. May Department Stores Co., parent of big &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; chains including Lord &amp; Taylor, Hecht\\'s, Filene\\'s and Foley\\'s, said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 4.4 percent, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; edged up 1.1 percent. But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the biggest discount retailers, continued to outperform the rest of the &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; industry, reporting comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 10 percent while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 25 percent. Analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores, especially those going into the Christmas season with high inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales. These retailers are expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise - and see their profits evaporate. Markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers, having seen one round of price reductions, wait for more merchandise to be marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts. When one retailer lowers prices, it pressures others to follow. Among other reports from retailers Thursday: -Dayton Hudson Corp. said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 4.1 percent, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; picked up 16.7 percent. -Kmart Corp. reported a 1.3 percent &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; gain at comparable stores, and an 11.2 percent rise overall. -Woolworth Corp. said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; increased 1 percent, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 4.2 percent. The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; report from the government. The Commerce Department\\'s figures includes &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.381226494643611  \\n   The signs say ``Always Open,\\'\\' but for the first time in 35 years, most of the 1,200 Denny\\'s restaurants across the United States will close their doors for Christmas Day. Locking those doors is a different story. Some buildings have been without locks for decades because of the always-open policy. At others, the locks have never been used and the keys can\\'t be found. The company is having to install locks at about 700 restaurants, said Joe Herrera, director of marketing at the company\\'s southern California headquarters. The company decided to close this year so &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; could have the day off. ``It will cost us about $5 million in sales,\\'\\' Herrera said. The chain\\'s 60,000 &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; were so grateful for the holiday that many sent cards and letters of appreciation to the offices, Herrera said. Employees received normal pay for Christmas Day. ``We just feel we spend 364 days a year taking care of other people\\'s families; for one day a year we want to take care of our own,\\'\\' he said. Nobody wants to work on Christmas, he said, and it has been the top turnover day of the year, with some managers losing four or five employees. In Hollywood, the companywide closing solved manager Almaz Legesse\\'s problem of choosing which &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; of a Sunset Boulevard restaurant to give the day off. ``I had a big list. ... I was having a hard time,\\'\\' she said. The restaurant, which serves more than 1,700 Christmas customers, was awaiting a visit from a locksmith. ``We never had locks,\\'\\' Ms. Legesse said. ``After so many years of working Christmas every year it\\'s real nice,\\'\\' said Lee Sevene, a manager at a Denny\\'s near a turnpike in Portland, Me. ``People have always thanked us a lot for staying open,\\'\\' said Frances Bushman, manager of a Pismo Beach, Calif., Denny\\'s. ``On the other hand they always felt sorry for our waitresses and cooks,\\'\\' she said. Ms. Bushman\\'s Denny\\'s has locks but she had to check to see if the keys fit. Christmases in the past have been about twice as busy as average days at Denny\\'s, Herrera said. ``We have up to an hour wait sometimes on Christmas, and that\\'s all day _ not just at midday,\\'\\' Herrera said. ``It actually starts on Christmas Eve, and just keeps going.\\'\\' The Christmas closing applied to 1,221 restaurants. The operators of 174 franchise restaurants were allowed to make their own decisions. Winifred Gibson, a manager at two Denny\\'s franchise restaurants in Fresno, Calif., said they would remain open for the biggest day of the year. But she sympathized with the trouble of locking up a Denny\\'s. ``Once I needed to lock the doors on my store. It was a major fiasco. It took us a day to find the keys,\\'\\' Ms. Gibson said. Christmas Day used to bring in mostly single people, couples with no children or elderly people with no family, she said. ``But not anymore. You have so many one-parent families.\\'\\' The three franchise Denny\\'s in Anchorage, Alaska, and one in Fairbanks will be open, said Donna Flanagan, manager of an Anchorage restaurant. Ms. Flanagan expects to serve about 1,500 people on Christmas, which is second only to Mother\\'s Day in bringing in customers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.363127625659827  \\n   Travelers on France\\'s superhighways will soon be able to dine on hamburgers at roadside fast-food restaurants. Burger King, in cooperation with the French restaurant and hotel company Elitair, announced plans Wednesday to open the first two fast-food restaurants at rest stops along the national highway network. One will be near Evry, southeast of Paris, on the A-6 highway. The other, a drive-through restaurant, will be near Bordeaux on the A-10 highway. Burger King also said the first fast-food hamburger restaurant at a French airport will open next month in a &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; area at Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris. &lt;/p&gt; 0.362468661632794  \\n   As the trademark piano received a final tuning, &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; help scurried around the new Nordstrom Inc. &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; unpacking the remaining boxes, rearranging clothes racks and getting to know the inventory. The opening of the Nordstrom &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; at the Garden State Plaza &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; mall in Paramus, N.J., marks the retailer\\'s first foray into the fiercely competitive Northeast. The official debut occurs Friday when the 245,000-square-foot &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; opens for business. Members of the media were given a preview tour of the &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday. Operating in this area might pose the biggest challenge yet for the West Coast &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; that has been migrating eastward as part of an ambitious expansion. A struggling regional economy has shaken consumer confidence and crimped spending. Crisis in the Middle East could further curb &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; spending as the critical holiday season approaches. Nonetheless, Nordstrom executives seem optimistic about entering the &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; and private analysts say the retailer stands a good chance to thrive here. Its service-oriented brand of retailing, combined with broad assortments of reliable quality merchandise, will give it an edge over rivals with less favorable reputations, analysts say. ``I think it\\'s probably one of the best _ if not the best _ &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in the country,\\'\\' said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Management Horizons, the &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; management and &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; research division of the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. ``The fact that the competition is in such a state of disarray might make it a good time to go into the Northeast.\\'\\' Richard Pyle, a &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; analyst at Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc., said Nordstrom, which focuses on women\\'s, men\\'s and children\\'s fashions, shoes and accessories, is in far better financial shape than its competitors. Some &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; stores, such as Macy\\'s _ which is a Nordstrom neighbor at the Garden State Plaza _ are courting &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; aggressively to boost business and pay off debts. Others, such as Saks Fith Avenue, are adjusting to life under new owners who are closely monitoring bottom lines. The 61-store Nordstrom &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; dates back to 1901 when Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom founded a Seattle shoe shop with money made mining gold in Alaska. Nordstrom still emphasizes shoes; the Paramus &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; boasts an inventory of some 70,000 ladies\\' shoes and 30,000 men\\'s. The &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; has historically prided itself on top-notch service and stories abound about its &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; associates going to unusual lengths to please people. ``Nordies\\'\\' have been known to personally deliver merchandise to customers\\' homes and to write thank-you notes to &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; _ typically on their own time. The legendary service has been a key to landing &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; in new markets. As elsewhere, the Paramus &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; employs personal shoppers who will help &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; select apparel, assemble outfits and accessorize. A concierge stationed near the entrance will steer &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; in the right direction and handle special requests. Shoppers have three restaurants to choose from on the store\\'s three levels and a spa offering massages, facials, manicures, pedicures and waxing. James F. Nordstrom, one of three descendents of the founder who currently bear the title co-chairman, said shoppers appreciate being treated well no matter what part of the country they live in. Apart from minor adjustments in merchandise mix, he said there have been no special adaptations made in bringing the Seattle-based retailer east. The &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; already operates two &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in the Virginia suburbs of Washington and intends to open two more in New Jersey over the next two years, plus one in New York in 1993. Its growth strategy calls for about four openings a year. ``We just think &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; like a lot of selection, good quality and to be treated nicely,\\'\\' he said in a telephone interview from the company\\'s headquarters. One blot on the Nordstrom name appeared earlier this year when the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries, acting after a union complaint, ruled that the company has failed to pay &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; for some of the extras they provide. The agency ordered Nordstrom to properly compensate &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; for work and to pay back wages. Industry analysts say Nordstrom has weathered the bad publicity without much damage to its reputation. A $15 million reserve the company set aside to pay back wage claims should be adequate. James Nordstrom said the labor problems, which have been confined mostly to the Seattle area, haven\\'t impaired the retailer\\'s results. Many &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; have proven their commitment to the company, he said, by paying their own way to transfer to new stores. The Paramus &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; will have about 100 &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; associates who have previously worked elsewhere for Nordstrom. An additional 100 managers were transferred by the company, which has a policy of promoting from within. About 900 &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; overall will work at the Garden State Plaza store. Nordstrom\\'s &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; and profits haven\\'t been as impressive lately as they had been in the recent past. Earnings slid 20 percent in the first half of this year to $49 million on &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; of $1.36 billion. That deterioration came after a 7 percent income drop last year to $115 million despite a 14.7 percent &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; gain to $2.7 billion. Nordstrom also has felt the pinch of the currently sluggish &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; climate. Co-chairman Nordstrom said, ``It\\'s fair to say that our planned increase in &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; is greater than the increase we\\'re experiencing.\\'\\' He said the retailer is taking a conservative approach to the coming season and will tighten inventory slightly. If business doesn\\'t measure up chainwide for a prolonged period, Nordstrom may scale back its expansion plans. ``We\\'re not going to leverage ourselves and grow for growth sake,\\'\\' Nordstrom said, noting that some openings may be delayed if necessary. At the Paramus store, &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; analysts say the company is hoping &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; will exceed $100 million in the first year. Nordstrom executives declined to disclose projections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  chrysler thompson ford auto motor corp motors assembly general uaw car cars industry domestic vehicles lee trucks truck vehicle sales &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.47906131784782  \\n   Chrysler Motors Corp. on Tuesday named Thomas Stallkamp chairman and Forest Farmer president of its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary. Stallkamp assumes the title previously held by Bob Lutz, chairman of Acustar and of Chrysler Motors, the automaking arm of Chrysler Corp. Lutz remains chairman of Chrysler Motors and a member of the corporation\\'s board. Stallkamp joined Chrysler Motors in 1980 as a &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; purchasing agent and moved to Acustar last June as vice president for marketing and procurement. Farmer succeeds Lee H. Runk, who resigned Monday to become president of the St. Louis-based Harvard Industries, an &lt;b&gt; auto &lt;/b&gt; parts supplier. Farmer has been with Chrysler for 20 years and has held a number of managerial positions. He most recently was &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; plants manager for &lt;b&gt; car &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; truck &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; assembly &lt;/b&gt; operations.

Jim Martin has ordered that Confederate flag bumper plates no longer be sold through privately run businesses that also sell North Carolina license plates and validation stickers. The rebel flag plates had been sold at many of the 125 offices. Martin decided to limit &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; of the plates after being questioned about them last week by a group of black business leaders in Winston-Salem, Division of Motor Vehicles Commissioner William Hiatt said Wednesday. Asked whether the plates being sold at the license plate agencies were in good taste, Martin said, ``Probably not.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; motor &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; vehicles &lt;/b&gt; commissioner can cancel a contract with a private license-plate agency with 60 days\\' notice and without reason, Hiatt said.

Industry analysts said &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; were higher in early June 1987 because a new round of buyer incentives had just been launched. They noted that 1988 spring &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; have held steady and consumer confidence remains strong. Car &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; were down during the period for all &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; makers except Toyota Motor Corp., which was just beginning U.S. production last year, and Mazda Motor Corp., which began U.S. production last September. ``The last 10 days of May were very strong and may have borrowed some &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; that normally would have occurred in the first 10 days of June,\\'\\' said Michael Luckey, president of Luckey Consulting Group in Cresskill, N.J. Luckey predicted &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; will be higher during the rest of the month. ``The consumer remains in a buying mood,\\'\\' he said.

Mike Venezia, the rider of more than 2,000 winners in more than 21,000 races since 1964, died in the fifth race on Thursday\\'s card, officials said. Robbie Davis, the rider of the other horse, was taken to a hospital for treatment of shock. Venezia\\'s mount, a 3-year-old gelding named Mr. Walter K., was humanely killed. Venezia, 43, was the first jockey killed at a New York Racing Association track since March 29, 1982, when Amado Credidio died after he was thrown over the top of a horse onto the ground and into the path of several other horses in a race at Aqueduct. Venezia\\'s mount broke his right foreleg going down the backstretch of a 1 1-16 mile allowance race. Venezia attempted to pull up the gelding, then went off the horse to his left and fell crosswise on the track, directly in the path of the other horse, Drums in the Night. ``I think he was dead when the (ambulance) technician got to him,\\'\\' Dr. Leo Skolnik, the examining NYRA physician, said. ``He was apparently kicked in the face. He had no pulse, no respiration and his pupils were dilated and fixed. ``I don\\'t see how a fall to the ground could have sustained this kind of injury.\\'\\' The last four races of Thursday\\'s card were canceled.

The &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are tuned to that program. The first two nights of the 1984 games were a Tuesday and a Wednesday, and had a combined &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 13.8 compared to 15.5 for this year, said ABC. ABC\\'s highest rated &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; wasn\\'t the Olympics, but the conclusion of the two-part miniseries ``Elvis and Me,\\'\\' the highest-rated miniseries so far this season. But NBC handily won the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; ending Feb. 14, with an average prime-time &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 16.2. ABC was second with 14.9. CBS was third with 14.2. After winning 19 of the 21 weeks so far in the season, NBC has an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 16.4, and CBS and ABC are tied with 13.6. The 10 top-rated shows of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``The Cosby Show\\'\\' NBC, ``A Different World\\'\\' NBC, ``Elvis and Me, Part 2\\'\\' ABC, ``Cheers\\'\\' NBC, ``Golden Girls\\'\\' NBC, ``Growing Pains\\'\\' ABC, ``Night Court\\'\\' NBC, ``Who\\'s the Boss?\\'\\' ABC, ``L.A. Law\\'\\' NBC and the Winter Olympics Sunday &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; on ABC. NBC\\'s new ``Sonny Spoon,\\'\\' starring Mario Van Peebles as a chameleon private eye, premiered last Friday with so-so numbers, ranking 49th. The lowest rated shows of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``Our House,\\'\\' Winter Olympics Saturday coverage, ``West 57th,\\'\\' ``The Law and Harry McGraw,\\'\\' ``Decision \\'88 _ The Iowa Caucus,\\'\\' ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\\'\\' ``The Thorns,\\'\\' ``48 Hours in Israel,\\'\\' ``Sledge Hammer!\\'\\' and ``The Charmings.\\'\\' For the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; ending Feb. 12, ABC\\'s ``World News Tonight\\'\\' had an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 11.8 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News\\'\\' had an 11.1 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News\\'\\' had a 10.9 and 19. Network analysts had no immediate explanation for ABC\\'s showing. However, last week\\'s &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; could have been affected by &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; of the Iowa caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential race. ``We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; of Chernobyl, and with live programming like the Iran hearings and political coverage,\\'\\' said ABC News spokeswoman Elise Adde. ABC\\'s prime-time special on Iowa ranked a respectable 44 out of 68. It followed the conclusion of ``Elvis and Me.\\'\\' NBC\\'s Iowa &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; ranked 63rd. CBS delayed its &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; of Iowa until 11:30 p.m. EST, after prime time. The last &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; ABC was first in &lt;b&gt; news &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; was the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; of Aug. 10, 1987. &lt;/p&gt; 0.673209979481173  \\n   It\\'s too early to tell how NBC\\'s 179 hours of prime-time Summer Olympics &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; will score in the ratings, but the first three nights started far off the &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; record set by the 1984 games on ABC. Nevertheless, the first three nights of &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; did land in the top 10 in the Nielsens last week, the final &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; year. Sunday night\\'s Olympics &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; was No. 2 among all prime-time shows, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., with a &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 17.7 and a 30 share. Saturday\\'s &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; came in ninth, with a &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 16.1 and a 31 share. The opening ceremonies Friday ranked 10th, with a 15.2 and 29. The &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; is a percentage of the nation\\'s estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The 1984 games averaged a 23.5 rating. People meters, the new viewer-measuring devices that have shown overall lower numbers for &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; shows, combined with a decline in &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; viewing may contribute to a depression in Olympics &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; this year. The first three nights of the Olympics averaged about a 30 share, somewhat lower than the third of the viewing audience NBC had predicted. NBC analyst Jeff Boehme said it was too early to tell if there\\'s a trend in the Olympics ratings. Monday night\\'s Olympics &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; continued to score disappointingly in the ratings, though it won the night for NBC. The &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; during prime &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; rated 18.0 with a 28 share. CBS had a 14.5 for the night, and ABC a 12.9. CBS effectively programmed against the Olympics on Sunday night with a repeat of the Valerie Bertinelli movie ``Rockabye\\'\\' that ranked fourth in the Nielsens. CBS also scored with its timely ``48 Hours\\'\\' on the approach of Hurricane Gilbert, getting the highest &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; yet for the weekly &lt;b&gt; news &lt;/b&gt; program. It ranked 12th with a 14.1 &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; and 24 share. NBC won the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; ending Sept. 18 with an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 14.0. CBS and ABC tied with 11.5 each. The &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; marked the 52nd since the 1987-88 fall &lt;b&gt; season &lt;/b&gt; began, so NBC claimed its fourth broadcast-year win in a row with an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 14.5. Although CBS finished third for the regular &lt;b&gt; season &lt;/b&gt; that ended in April, based on yearlong figures, CBS edged ABC for the &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; year with an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 12.2 to ABC\\'s 12.1. The top 10 shows last &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``A Different World\\'\\' NBC, ``Summer Olympics _ Sunday\\'\\' NBC, ``The Cosby Show\\'\\' NBC, ``Rockabye\\'\\' CBS, ``Monday Night Football\\'\\' ABC, ``60 Minutes\\'\\' CBS, ``Barbara Walters\\'\\' ABC, ``Murder, She Wrote\\'\\' CBS, ``Summer Olympics _ Saturday\\'\\' and ``Summer Olympics _ Opening\\'\\' NBC. The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``Live! Dick Clark Presents,\\'\\' ``The Flintstones _ Just Say No,\\'\\' ``The `Slap\\' Maxwell Story,\\'\\' ``Cowboy Joe,\\'\\' ``California Girls Special,\\'\\' ``Lily Tomlin _ Sold Out,\\'\\' ``West 57th,\\'\\' ``Live from the Hard Rock Cafe,\\'\\' ``Space _ Beyond the Shuttle\\'\\' and ``Decision \\'88 Countdown.\\'\\' Despite a move to a half-hour earlier in New York, where its &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; dropped, the ``CBS Evening News\\'\\' rebounded into first place in the national &lt;b&gt; news &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; after tying with ABC\\'s ``World News Tonight\\'\\' the previous week. The &lt;b&gt; news &lt;/b&gt; race last &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; continued to be a virtual dead heat, with less than a point separating the three &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; newscasts. CBS had a 10.8 &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; and 22 share, ABC had 10.3 and 21, and ``NBC Nightly News\\'\\' had a &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 10.1 and a 20 share. &lt;/p&gt; 0.621504460950423  \\n   ABC\\'s ``Roseanne\\'\\' edged NBC\\'s ``The Cosby Show\\'\\' as prime-time &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; champ in the just-concluded 1989-1980 season, NBC announced Monday. ABC\\'s Tuesday comedy starring Roseanne Barr averaged a 23.3 rating, two-tenths of a &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; point more than the Bill Cosby family comedy which has been first in the Nielson &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; for the last four seasons. ``The Cosby Show,\\'\\' wound up in second place for the season. Cosby\\'s &lt;b&gt; series &lt;/b&gt; has been on the air for six seasons, and Barr\\'s &lt;b&gt; series &lt;/b&gt; for two. Each &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; point represents 921,000 homes. Final figures for the 30-week season, which ended Sunday, won\\'t be available until Tuesday. But &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; research analysts say that NBC will easily win its fifth consecutive season, with ABC coming in second, and once-dominant CBS in third place for the third straight season. Still awaiting final figures for the last three days of the season, Preston Beckman, NBC vice-president for research, said that NBC thus far had a 14.6 &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; average, ABC a 12.9 and CBS a 12.2 during the season. NBC\\'s &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; are down by nine percent, ABC\\'s are flat, and those of CBS are down by three percent, he said. He cited competition from cable, the fledgling Fox network, and independent stations as factors in the overall &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; drop. However, he attributed 25 percent of NBC\\'s decline to the absence of three &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; events it had in prime &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; during the previous &lt;b&gt; season &lt;/b&gt; _ the Summer Olypmics, the World Series and pro football\\'s Superbowl. &lt;/p&gt; 0.598854649155634  \\n   Two new situation comedies starring Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, respectively, are gone from CBS\\' schedule, the &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; announced Tuesday in a schedule shakeup that dumps two of the three CBS shows produced by Grant Tinker\\'s GTG Entertainment. The network, which has ranked last in the &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; so far this season, said ``Annie McGuire,\\'\\' starring Miss Moore, would have its last &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; in its Wednesday &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; period on Dec. 28, suggesting it might be brought back in the future. But the &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; said ``The Van Dyke Show\\'\\' and ``Raising Miranda,\\'\\' the GTG shows, would have their final broadcasts this month. ``Dirty Dancing,\\'\\' a half-hour &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; based on the hit movie of the same name will go ``on hiatus\\'\\' in January. ``Simon &amp; Simon,\\'\\' the long-running, on-again, off-again detective series, has its last &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; in its Saturday &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; period on Dec. 31. CBS left the door open to reviving it yet again. GTG Entertainment was established by former NBC chairman and MTM Productions head Grant Tinker in partnership with Gannett. Tinker founded MTM Productions with his then-wife, Mary Tyler Moore. The third GTG &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; for CBS, the critically praised ``TV101,\\'\\' an hourlong, teen-appeal drama, is being moved next month from its low-rated Tuesday &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; slot to Wednesday in place of the Moore and Van Dyke shows. GTG has also not fared well with its only other current TV enterprise, the syndicated newsmagazine &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; ``USA Today: The Television Show,\\'\\' though the company insists it is sticking by that &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; for the long haul. In the most recent &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; from the A.C. Nielsen Co., ``Annie McGuire\\'\\' and ``The Van Dyke Show\\'\\' were the lowest-rated &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; shows of the week. ``Raising Miranda\\'\\' was the third lowest-rated &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; last week. Both ``Annie McGuire\\'\\' and ``The Van Dyke Show\\'\\' had problems from the start. Both pilots were re-shot and the Moore &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; was partially recast. They then emerged to almost universally negative reviews, even though their stars are two of the most popular sitcom performers ever. Moore and Van Dyke co-starred in ``The Dick Van Dyke Show\\'\\' in the 1960s, and Moore starred as Mary Richards in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\'\\' in the 1970s. CBS announced that ``Tour of Duty,\\'\\' a Vietnam series, will return to the schedule Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST. ``Dolphin Cove,\\'\\' starring Frank Converse as a dolphin researcher in Australia, will join the schedule in January in place of ``Dirty Dancing\\'\\' and ``Raising Miranda\\'\\' on Saturday night. The Smothers Brothers will also return to the schedule for four shows in January and February. &lt;/p&gt; 0.467084372161384  \\n   President Bush\\'s State of the Union message will be aired live tonight on the major networks. Bush\\'s address will be &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; at 9 p.m. EST on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and C-Span, followed by a Democratic response from House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. Some local affiliates of PBS and Univision, a Spanish international network, also will carry the address and response, either live or as a tape-delayed broadcast.

Security Council Resolution 678, passed 12-2 Thursday, which gives Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait or face possible military action by member states: The Security Council, Recalling and reaffirming its resolutions 660 (1990), 661 (1990), 662 (1990), 664 (1990), 665 (1990), 666 (1990), 667 (1990), 669 (1990), 670 (1990), 674 (1990), and 677 (1990). Noting that, despite all efforts by the United Nations, Iraq refuses to comply with its obligation to implement Resolution 660 (1990) and the above subsequent relevant resolutions, in flagrant contempt of the Council, Mindful of its duties and responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security, Determined to secure full compliance with its decisions, Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 1. Demands that Iraq comply fully with Resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and decides, while maintaining all its decisions, to allow Iraq one final opportunity, as a pause of goodwill, to do so; 2. Authorizes member &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; cooperating with the government of Kuwait, unless Iraq on or before 15 January 1991 fully implements, as set forth in paragraph 1 above, the foregoing resolutions, to use all necessary means to uphold and implement Security Council Resolution 660 and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area; 3. Requests all &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; to provide appropriate support for the actions undertaken in pursuance of paragraph 2 of this resolution; 4. Requests the &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; concerned to keep the Council regularly informed on the progress of actions undertaken pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this resolution; 5. Decides to remain seized of the matter (keep the matter under active consideration). &lt;/p&gt; 0.432122878464304  \\n   Iraq said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; it had moved Western detainees to vital military targets, making good on its threat to use them as human shields against a potential American attack. The message came after Iraq warned its own people not to hide foreigners or they would face the ``severest punishment.\\'\\' Iraq had threatened earlier to use the trapped foreigners as shields, and today\\'s statement by the official Iraqi News Agency said some had already been scattered at the target sites. The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a spokesman for the Iraqi National Council as saying: ``Iraq\\'s foreign guests have been in fact moved to all vital and military installations. They have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in good physical condition.\\'\\' The three-line dispatch provided no further details, such as how many foreigners had been moved or to what installations. Earlier, President Bush demanded that Iraq release all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, and for the first time he referred to them as hostages. ``There can be little doubt that whatever these innocent citizens are called, they are in fact hostages,\\'\\' he said in a speech to &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; veterans in Baltimore. Also today, two senior U.N. officials headed for Baghdad to urge Iraq to free foreigners held captive in Kuwait and Iraq. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein requested the envoys be sent. In his speech, Bush repeated U.S. demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. He also likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler. An Iraqi official also referred to World War II today, reminding the United States that it had once interned members of its own ethnic Japanese population. ``In response to the official American and Western declarations regarding Iraq\\'s hosting of foreigners ... We would like to recall that America, during World War II, held about 100,000 of its own citizens of Japanese origin in detention camps to avert a potential Japanese attack on its western coast,\\'\\' said the statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. It was attributed to the Speaker of the Iraqi National Council, or parliament, Sadi Mehdi Saleh. The United States, meanwhile, picked up another ally in its military thrust against Iraq with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney\\'s announcement &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that U.S. C-130 cargo transports have begun operating from the United Arab Emirates. Cheney\\'s statement in Abu Dhabi marked an important show of cooperation from a &lt;b&gt; gulf &lt;/b&gt; nation with international efforts to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Also today, OPEC said there was not enough support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider Saudi Arabia\\'s request to boost oil production. A brief statement said OPEC\\'s president would meet with some other oil ministers before the end of the month. Saudi Arabia said Saturday it would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels a day. Iraq said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that diplomats who fail to close their missions in Kuwait by Friday will be treated as any other foreign citizen. But in London, the Foreign office said Britain will attempt to keep an embassy in Kuwait. Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and West Germany said they had no plans to close their missions in Kuwait. The Iraqi radio message, monitored in Nicosia, warned Iraqi citizens against secretly sheltering foreigners to protect them. ``Hosting a foreigner in an Iraqi\\'s place of residence is considered a flagrant violation of the law, for which the severest punishments will be given,\\'\\' it said. It said the law applied ``with (Iraq\\'s) entire administrative border\\'\\' _ apparently including annexed Kuwait. On Sunday, Saddam offered to free foreigners if the United States withdraws its &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; from the Persian Gulf region and guarantees the economic embargo will be lifted. U.S. officials dismissed the offer. He later said he would free citizens of &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; that remain neutral in the conflict, including those of Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Portugal. They account for only about 600 of the 21,000 foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. There was growing international anxiety over the fate of the remaining foreign captives, including 3,000 Americans and 4,000 Britons, held for almost three weeks. Saddam said Sunday Westerners will be held at vital Iraqi installations to deter U.S. attacks on the facilities. ``Our people are seeking to avert a catastrophe,\\'\\' Saddam said, in comments read on Iraqi television. ``The presence of the foreigners with Iraqi families at vital targets might prevent an attack.\\'\\' Iraqi authorities also ordered Westerners in Kuwait to assemble at hotels or face the consequences. In other developments: _The White House said U.S. warships were still ``shadowing\\'\\' two Iraqi tankers, which ignored warning shots fired by the U.S. vessels on Saturday. _U.S. warships off the United Arab Emirates were challenging by radio practically every commercial ship coursing up and down the Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported today. _Iraq said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that Indonesian and some Argentine citizens may leave. _China\\'s official Xinhua News Agency said the first group of 97 Chinese would be evacuated from Iraq today, with Baghdad\\'s help. Also today, 122 Soviet citizens crossed into Jordan, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. _The British Foreign Office said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that 82 Britons were taken Sunday by Iraqi authorities from a hotel in Kuwait city. A day earlier, 41 British citizens were taken from the Kuwait International hotel. _Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal arrived in Damascus, Syria &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; to discuss the Gulf &lt;b&gt; crisis &lt;/b&gt; with the Syrian leadership. _Two Dutch Navy frigates were leaving &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; for the Persian Gulf to join the multinational force arrayed against Iraq. The air defense frigate Witte de With and the standard frigate Pieter Florisz were to take two weeks to reach the region. _ Greece also said it would send a frigate. _Iraqi soldiers &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; continued their withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing up thousands of battle-hardened &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; to face U.S. forces. Iraq and Iran were also repatriating prisoners from their eight-year war, which effectively ended with a cease-fire in August of 1988. _Iranian newspapers &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; attacked the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. The Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial the United States had virtually annexed Saudi Arabia, just as Iraq did Kuwait. But the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S. military presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. United Arab Emirates, an alliance comprising seven sheikdoms, &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; became the first of the moderate Arab governments in the southern &lt;b&gt; gulf &lt;/b&gt; region to publicly announce overt military cooperation with the United States. On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates announced it would allow the deployment of Arab and ``friendly\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; on its territory as part of multinational efforts to defend the Persian Gulf region. On Saturday night, the U.N. Security Council unanimously demanded that Iraq let all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait leave. CBS News said from Baghdad that 35 Americans, including four women and three children, took refuge at U.S. diplomatic ``quarters\\'\\' in the Iraqi capital Sunday. Asked about the report, a spokesman at the State Department said: ``We can\\'t make a comment on that at this time.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.431678616653974  \\n   Twenty-five Portuguese stone masons returned to their homeland Thursday after Iraqi authorities allowed them to leave Baghdad. The workers finished contracts last week to install marble in a palace for President Saddam Hussein on the banks of the River Tigris in the Iraqi capital. A spokesman for the group, Joao Cacador, said Baghdad authorities granted exit visas to the Portuguese after the Iraqi company supervising work on palace appealed to Saddam\\'s office on their behalf. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, on working visit to Spain, said he was overjoyed to hear the Portuguese men had left Iraq. Iraq has held thousands of foreigners in their country in the aftermath of the Aug. 2 &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; of Kuwait, including Westerners in strategic sites thought to be the targets of a possible U.S. attack. &lt;/p&gt; 0.420465917711322  \\n   The Foreign Ministry said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; Iraq\\'s failure to free 1,000 Soviets could lead to a ``tougher attitude\\'\\' toward Iraq\\'s &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; of Kuwait. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin demanded the immediate release of the Soviets. He also told reporters Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq for four hours &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; to reiterate the demand that Iraq withdraws its &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; from Kuwait. Churkin said Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia would meet with Shevardnadze on Tuesday to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis. He said Iraq agree to allow 1,000 Soviets, mostly contract workers, to leave during November but that only about 350 were permitted to do so. When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there were about 8,000 Soviets, including several hundred military advisers, in Iraq. About 3,000 Soviets, including women and children, were allowed to leave shortly after the &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; and about 1,000 left during September and October. Churkin said Iraq agreed to allow another 1,000 to leave in November, but is not living up to its promise. ``Iraq is not keeping its agreement that our citizens will not be prevented from leaving,\\'\\' he said. ``This is totally abnormal and unacceptable.\\'\\' He added, ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our citizens to leave, this will complicate the present situation even further and force us to take a tougher attitude.\\'\\' Churkin said that to his knowledge, no Soviets were being detained at potential military targets. ``All (Soviet) nationals are still where they were before the crisis,\\'\\' he said. Iraq has prevented hundreds of foreigners from leaving Iraq and Kuwait since Saddam Hussein\\'s &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; overran the emirate four months ago. It has been slowly releasing some foreigners. &lt;/p&gt; 0.411560921062179  \\n   Iraq said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; it will put President Bush on trial Oct. 15 for ``crimes against the peoples of the world.\\'\\' Iraq first announced its plan to put Bush on trial on Sept. 12, shortly after Western officials suggested Iraqi President Saddam Hussein be tried for crimes against humanity for the use of chemical weapons in 1988 against Iraq\\'s minority Kurdish population. Baghdad accuses Bush of planning a &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; against Iraq, attempting genocide by sponsoring U.N. sanctions on Iraq for its &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; of Kuwait, and committing aggression against Panama and Grenada, according to Hamid Al-Rawi, chairman of Iraq\\'s bar association and head of a panel preparing for the trial. ``Bush has committed many crimes since he took office as president of the United States and also before that when he was vice president,\\'\\' the English language Baghdad Observer quoted Al-Rawi as saying in today\\'s editions. He was quoted as saying the United States, which has sent more than 150,000 &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; to the Persian Gulf to counter Iraq, had committed ``a crime against peace, punishable by international law.\\'\\' Al-Rawi said the trial would be an ``international process\\'\\' with witnesses from other countries and Arab and non-Arab jurists. It would be conducted on the same basis as the Nuremberg trials of Nazi &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; criminals following World War II, he said. Other accusations against Bush include the enforcement by the United States ``of an economic blockade against the people of Iraq with the aim of starving children, women and elderly to death, and also preventing food, medicine and baby milk from reaching the country in violation of the the U.N. charter.\\'\\' ``This is a crime punishable by international conventions which consider this an act of genocide,\\'\\' Al-Rawi was quoted as saying. AlRawi did not say what the punishment might be if Bush is convicted during the three-day trial. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  film art movie arts works artists collection disney films entertainment american sotheby\\'s company stars pictures theaters actors grants auction stolen &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.562245781749375  \\n   Andy Warhol\\'s plastic wristwatches of Fred Flintstone, Judy Jetson and Gumby reached $2,640 in a ``wild\\'\\' bidding war _ $2,590 more than the timepieces cost the late artist in a department store, Sotheby\\'s said. Kitschy collectibles were only some of the objects on sale Wednesday during the fifth day of the 10-day &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; of Warhol\\'s possessions. There was also serious jewelry on the block. American Indian art, including ``no end of turquoise jewelry\\'\\' was to be sold at today\\'s auction, said Diana Brooks, president of Sotheby\\'s North America. So far, Warhol\\'s &lt;b&gt; collection &lt;/b&gt; has fetched $9,072,000, more than twice Sotheby\\'s high estimate of $3,951,000. Only 37 out of some 1,400 lots have not sold, she said. The highest bid Wednesday was $55,000 for a pair of surrealist ear clips by artist Salvador Dali, according to Ms. Brooks. The buyer, a private collector, was not identified. The ear clips, asymmetrical ruby-studded hearts with a honeycomb center set with round diamonds, had a pre-sale estimated value of $10,000 to $15,000. An 18-karat gold, garnet and diamond circular pendant, also by Dali, brought $47,300, Ms. Brooks said. The pendant, estimated at $7,500 to $10,000, depicted the profiles of Tristan and Isolde separated by a chalice. The brightly-colored cartoon watches, made by Lewco, were decorated with raised, full-length figures of Fred and Dino, his pet dinosaur; Judy Jetson standing with hands on hips; and a smiling Gumby. Warhol bought them in 1985 and 1986 at Bloomingdale\\'s, Ms. Brooks said. In their original plastic packaging, the watches bore the original price tags of $20 and $10, she said. ``People were so wild to have the three plastic watches in the sale. They sort of symbolize the sale of the whole &lt;b&gt; collection &lt;/b&gt; _ something people will remember,\\'\\' she said. The pre-sale estimate was $60 to $80 for all three. But in ``wild bidding\\'\\' that came down to a telephone contest between four people, the price climbed to $2,640, Ms. Brooks said. A private collector, who was not identified, won the bidding. Bloomingdale\\'s still sells the watches in some stores, said Miraed Smith, a store spokeswoman. Another wristwatch that did well at the &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; was a stainless steel piece, dated 1948, with a photo image of Gene Autry and signed ``always your pal Gene Autry.\\'\\' Sotheby\\'s estimated it would sell for $50 to $100 but it went for $1,870, Ms. Brooks said. Proceeds from the &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; will benefit the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which will award &lt;b&gt; grants &lt;/b&gt; to cultural institutions in the United States and abroad. Warhol died at age 58 last year. &lt;/p&gt; 0.520168825055959  \\n   Claude Monet\\'s Impressionist painting of his wife in a meadow became the third highest priced work at &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, going for $24.59 million to an anonymous telephone bidder, Sotheby\\'s said. The price for ``Dans La Prairie\\'\\' (``In the Meadow\\'\\') broke the record for a Monet set 24 hours earlier at Christie\\'s, which sold his painting of a blue house for $6.55 million, also to an anonymous telephone bidder. The two sales of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture by the rival firms totaled nearly $123.5 million. Sotheby\\'s also sold a Monet landscape for $2 million and set a record price for Pierre Bonnard, whose painting of a woman in her bath fetched $3.78 million. A picture of two women musicians by Henri Matisse sold for $2.83 million. Only one buyer of &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; realizing more than 1 million pounds ($1.72 million) was identified: Japan\\'s Fujii Gallery paid $2.17 million for Pierre-Auguste Renoir\\'s portrait of a young woman in a yellow hat. ``The picture of his wife was Monet\\'s most important work to appear on the market for 20 years,\\'\\' said Sotheby\\'s expert, Michel Strauss. ``There was ferocious bidding which lasted for five minutes between two people on the telephone and no one in the saleroom appeared to be bidding while it was going on,\\'\\' said Fiona Ford, Sotheby\\'s spokeswoman. Auctioneer Julian Barran opened the bidding at $6.8 million after Sotheby\\'s had estimated the picture to be worth around $10.3 million. The highest &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; prices have been paid for flower paintings by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. His ``Irises\\'\\' sold to an anonymous buyer at Sotheby\\'s in New York last November for $53.9 million. Van Gogh\\'s ``Sunflowers\\'\\' was bought by a Japanese insurance &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; at Christie\\'s in London in March 1987 for $39.85 million. Monet, a Frenchman known as the father of Impressionism and the greatest master of that style, painted his wife in 1876 when they were living at Argenteuil near Paris. The summery picture depicts Camille in a white dress and hat, with a parasol behind her, reading a book as she lies among tall grass and wild flowers. The picture was sold by trustees of the estate of the late David David-Weill, an &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; collector who bought it about 1938 in Paris from the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; dealers, Wildenstein. &lt;/p&gt; 0.479530940677886  \\n   Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday it will prohibit paid screen advertising in all &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; theaters &lt;/b&gt; showing the company\\'s films. The policy will begin in March with Disney\\'s release of the &lt;b&gt; film &lt;/b&gt; ``Pretty Woman.\\'\\' ``Our patrons don\\'t dislike screen advertising, they hate it,\\'\\' said Richard Cook, president of Disney\\'s Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Audiences, he said, ``do not come to experience the mundane. They come to escape it. We must not so insult our paying guests (with commercials) and we won\\'t.\\'\\' Disney plans to enforce the anti-ad policy by revoking a theater\\'s license to show Disney movies if it shows advertisements. Cook said the action was essential to the continued financial health of the exhibition of motion &lt;b&gt; pictures &lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; theaters. ``We have been told repeatedly by moviegoers that they do not want and will not tolerate commercial intrusions in &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; theaters,\\'\\' Cook said in remarks given at the 1990 convention of the National Association of Theater Owners. The Disney announcement was greeted by some groans. A number of theater owners depend on paid advertising to generate extra income. Terry Laughren, president of Screenvision Cinema Network, the nation\\'s leading cinema advertising company, said such advertisements bring theater owners millions of dollars annually. ``It\\'s real money. It\\'s not pocket change,\\'\\' said Laughren, whose &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; has placed ads in about 35 percent of the nation\\'s 17,500 first-run &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; theaters. Cook said Disney won\\'t demand that &lt;b&gt; theaters &lt;/b&gt; break existing contracts with advertisers, but the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; will encourage the theater owners to get out of such contracts. Disney defines screen advertisements as commercials for goods and services projected on the screen in the same theater where Disney &lt;b&gt; films &lt;/b&gt; are shown. Previews of upcoming attractions, slides projected for products during intermission and approved charitable advertisements are not affected by the ban, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.469867410541381  \\n   Occasionally, an &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; theft reads like the plot from an Ian Fleming thriller in which half-mad billionaires pay slick international thieves to steal famous paintings for their private pleasure. In reality, experts said Monday, most &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; is &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; to earn a quick buck in an international black market that is second in size only to the drug trade. The priceless &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; Sunday from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is too famous to be sold anywhere, raising the spectre that the pieces could be held hostage for ransom for a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; world says the paintings are worth. The true scale of the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; underworld is difficult to gauge, but investigators say &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; thievery is increasing as prices for &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; on the legal market soar. ``There\\'s a lot of it going on,\\'\\' said Robert W. Holmes Jr., a Boston attorney specializing in fine &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; transactions. ``Ninety percent of &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; is never recovered. There\\'s obviously a market there.\\'\\' Rarely, one end of the market is held up by someone who decides to commission the theft of a painting that cannot be legitimately acquired. One such theft occurred in 1983, when thieves stole Italian Renaissance masterpieces, including Raphael\\'s self portrait, from the Hungarian national museum in Budapest. Investigators found that a sophisticated band of Italian &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; thieves, armed with cutting tools and high-tech alarm-busting devices, executed a perfect break-in and vanished with the works. An extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home country before they could get the paintings to Greece where, it was later found, an olive oil baron had paid a handsome sum for the sake of having the &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; hang in his home. ``There aren\\'t many thieves with that sort of expertise,\\'\\' said Robert Volpe, a former New York City police detective who worked on the Hungarian case and is now a private consultant tracing &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; around the world. ``They were capable of stealing anything.\\'\\' But most of the black market in &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; is in lesser-known &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; usually ranging in value from $100,000 to $300,000. Priceless &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; such as the Vermeer taken from the Gardner Museum are simply too famous to be sold anywhere. ``It\\'s incredibly stupid to steal a Vermeer or a Rembrandt,\\'\\' said Steven Keller, a private security consultant who was brought in as security director at The Art Institute of Chicago after a major theft of three &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; there by Cezanne in 1979. ``He (the Gardner thief) has got some things that are too hot to handle,\\'\\' Keller said. Keller said lesser-known &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; and prints that could be sold more easily were more valuable to thieves than masterworks that couldn\\'t be fenced. ``You might be able to sell say, a lesser-known American artist\\'s painting in Europe,\\'\\' Keller said. ``It\\'s harder to spot them.\\'\\' Often, thieves who can\\'t sell &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; underground hold it ransom for insurance money, a scenario several investigators and curators said was likely in the Gardner theft. Last year, for instance, thieves stole three paintings by van Gogh, demanded a $2.2 million ransom and returned one of the works. The others were later recovered and four people suspected of the theft were arrested. ``It happens, and it happens frequently,\\'\\' Holmes said. ``But like any hostage situation, it\\'s got to be outside the public eye, so often these cases go unnoticed.\\'\\' Keller, noting the relative worth of the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; from the Gardner Museum, said, ``If I were the thief of the Gardner paintings, I\\'d ship the Vermeer and the Rembrandt back to the museum and go for a ransom on the smaller works.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.459234620845154  \\n   Woody Allen has added his next three &lt;b&gt; pictures &lt;/b&gt; to his exclusive agreement with Orion Pictures Corp. as writer, director and producer.

Also starring in ``Alice\\'\\' are Alec Baldwin, Blythe Danner, Judy Davis, William Hurt and Cybill Shepherd.

The &lt;b&gt; victims &lt;/b&gt; apparently were chosen at random during a four-hour spree of shootings and robberies Sunday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; throughout this central California &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; of 350,000 people, said Sgt. Mike Guthrie. ``There doesn\\'t seem to be any identifiable pattern,\\'\\' Guthrie said. ``I think it was more driving until they saw an opportunity and taking it.\\'\\' Police &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; four boys, ages 14, 15, 16 and 17, and confiscated five guns early Monday. All of those &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; are from Fresno, Guthrie said. Each was charged with one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of armed robbery. Their names were withheld because of their ages. One suspect remained at large and additional charges were pending against the four held, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. Besides the three shotguns, one rifle and a handgun, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; seized crack cocaine from one of the youths, Guthrie said. The rampage began after uniformed &lt;b&gt; officers &lt;/b&gt; patrolled a drug-infested west Fresno neighborhood called ``the U,\\'\\' said Guthrie. Five gang members intended to shoot rivals, but left the area because of the police, Guthrie said. After the fatal &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; downtown, one juvenile left the group, Guthrie said. The other four robbed and &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; people along an eight-mile stretch north to near Fresno State University, then headed back downtown, he said. ``This entire scenario was an afterthought,\\'\\' Guthrie said. The &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; spree was ``unprecedented in our city,\\'\\' he said. ``I can recall nothing of this magnitude ... There very easily could have been half a dozen or more murder victims.\\'\\' Police blamed the juveniles for the &lt;b&gt; killing &lt;/b&gt; of a 47-year-old &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; and shootings that left six other &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; wounded. Two remained hospitalized Monday in serious condition, said Sgt. Dwight Williamson. The others weren\\'t seriously wounded, he said. The victims\\' names were withheld released. Three other people were injured in shootings Sunday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; and investigators were trying to determine whether the same youths were to blame. &lt;/p&gt; 0.619373130670238  \\n   A motorist who was stopped early today on suspicion of drunken driving grabbed an officer\\'s gun, wounding the officer and a second policeman before &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; himself to death, &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; said. Pembina County Sheriff\\'s Deputy Miles Nelson stopped the suspect on a possible charge of driving under the influence shortly after 1 a.m., according to Deputy Cal Cluchie. An ``altercation\\'\\' occurred in which the &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; took Nelson\\'s service handgun and &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; him, Cluchie said. Nelson managed to call for assistance as the &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; fled. Cavalier Police Chief James Johnson, responding to the call, was also wounded as he attempted to stop the man, Cluchie said. The suspect was later &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; nearby with a fatal gunshot wound, apparently self-inflicted, he said. Nelson was listed in critical condition at the United Hospital in Grand Forks, and Johnson is listed in stable condition at Pembina County Memorial Hospital. No other details were immediately available. Cavalier is located about 15 miles south of the Canadian border in northeastern North Dakota. &lt;/p&gt; 0.591449050027766  \\n   Four people were fatally &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; and eight wounded in gang-style attacks across Southern California on Halloween and early today, and a 15-month-old boy &lt;b&gt; died &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; day &lt;/b&gt; after he was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; in the head outside a birthday party. An unidentified 20-year-old &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; early today while walking on a street in Monrovia, about 15 miles northeast of Los Angeles, sheriff\\'s Deputy Detta Roberts said. A gang connection was being investigated; no arrests were made. In southwest Los Angeles, a 19-year-old &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; reputed to be a gang member was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; late Monday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; when rival gang members ambushed a group of young people as they left a liquor store, officials said. Four people were wounded, one of them critically. The name of the &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; who was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; was not immediately released, and there were no arrests. In San Diego, two unidentified &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and three &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; wounded in three street shootings Monday night, &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; reported. Dalafayette Polk, the toddler injured in the birthday party &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; Sunday in the Watts section of Los Angeles, &lt;b&gt; died &lt;/b&gt; at 12:30 p.m. Monday, said Paitoon Wisuskeow, a nurse at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. Nine other people were wounded in the &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; Sunday night, one of the worst outbreaks of street violence by youth gangs. Police had made no arrests by early today. In downtown Los Angeles, a 15-year-old identified by &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; as a gang member was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; twice Monday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; by by gang members driving by, said &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; Officer J.R. Smith. The teen-ager was reported in satisfactory condition at California Medical Center today. &lt;/p&gt; 0.583347799642819  \\n   Gang members returning from a friend\\'s funeral allegedly used two rented limousines in a drive-by &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; that wounded one man, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. The unidentified &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; was treated for a gunshot wound to the foot at Brotman Medical Center in Culver City after the 2:30 p.m. Thursday shooting, Sgt. Bob James said. James said no arrests were made immediately, but the limousines were impounded and the drivers questioned and released. ``These drivers don\\'t know what these people are doing,\\'\\' James said. ``These people are in the back partying. The drivers don\\'t know what\\'s going on.\\'\\' On Tuesday, gang members opened fire from a limousine and &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; 19-year-old Robert Lewis Riley Jr., &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. Both shootings were under investigation. &lt;/p&gt; 0.571094354633758  \\n   At least 100 people, some armed with guns or baseball bats, converged on a low-income neighborhood Tuesday night, apparently to protest &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; handling of a teen-ager\\'s death, &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; said. Shots were fired, and bottles and bricks were thrown, but no serious injuries were reported in this &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; of nearly 40,000 people on Lake Michigan, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. ``We\\'ve had shots going off all night,\\'\\' said policeman Mike Elkins. `No shots have been fired by us. We\\'re in full riot gear.\\'\\' About 20 people had been &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; by 10:30 p.m., three hours after the disturbance by at least 100 people began in a four-block section of the neighborhood. State and county &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; and state prison &lt;b&gt; officers &lt;/b&gt; were dispatched to help &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; control the crowd, Elkins said. ``I know there were problems up there last night,\\'\\' said LaPorte County sheriff\\'s Sgt. Mark Ludlow. ``I don\\'t think its fair to call it a riot, maybe a civil disturbance.\\'\\' There were minor injuries, but it was not immediately known how many people had been hurt, Ludlow said. The disturbance was apparently a protest of the &lt;b&gt; death &lt;/b&gt; late Monday of Chris Crawford, 16, and the wounding of his cousin Michael Cain, 17. Cain, who was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; in the left side, said he and Crawford were standing near a video arcade when they were approached by an unknown &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; who fought with them. Cain said his cousin was forced into the street, then hit by a &lt;b&gt; car &lt;/b&gt; and killed. Cain said he was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; as the vehicle passed. He was taken to Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and released. Residents of the neighborhood, which is near a housing project, said &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; were less responsive to crimes in their area than in more affluent neighborhoods. Police took more than an hour to reach the scene of Monday night\\'s violence, said resident Vince Woodard. ``We called them on 911 and they didn\\'t come,\\'\\' Woodard said. Elkins disputed allegations that &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; were slow to respond Monday. ``I\\'m sure in a case like that we were there right away,\\'\\' he said. The officer said &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; dispatchers received the call at 11:39 p.m. and arrived at the scene within a minute. ``We\\'re only a couple of blocks away,\\'\\' Elkins said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt;\"'</span>",

Thursday\\'s ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis apparently affects only those who were in training when time the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; ended their walkout, said E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. Still, Breen said, ``It\\'s clearly a major victory.\\'\\' All but 200 of the 3,600 &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; walked off the job in sympathy with Machinists who struck the Miami-based &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; in March 1989. Pilots ended their sympathy walkout in November, but fewer than 50 have been called back to Eastern, &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; association officials say. The Machinists are still striking. At least 404 &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; were in training when the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; returned to work, the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; association says. The &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; estimates only 180 jobs are affected by the ruling, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. Further hearings likely will be determine the exact number of affected jobs, Breen said. Eastern said in a statement it would appeal the decision. The &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; predicted the ruling wouldn\\'t immediately affect current &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; or operations. Many &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; took jobs with other &lt;b&gt; airlines &lt;/b&gt; after the strike began March 4, 1989, but about 1,400 former Eastern &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; may still be interested in returning, pilots\\' association spokesman Lou Baldwin said. Davis\\' ruling stems from the association\\'s challenge of Eastern\\'s claim that the formerly striking &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; were not needed. Davis agreed that the federal Railway Labor Act guarantees returning strikers job rights ahead of newly hired trainees. Davis said Eastern violated the Railway Labor Act by hiring pilot trainees not already qualified to fly regular flights. The act was devised to provide ``uninterrupted transportation service,\\'\\' the ruling said. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike began. It presently operates about 800 flights, down from its pre-strike &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; of 1,040. Ms. Ceremsak said she does not believe Davis\\' ruling must receive bankruptcy court approval. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, all returning &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; would need to go through several weeks of recertification training under the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern officials said. Eastern currently has about 1,900 pilots, including those trained before the strike was settled, &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; hired from other &lt;b&gt; airlines &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; who later crossed picket lines. Baldwin said the Eastern &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; trainees\\' annual pay is about $27,000. The average pre-strike pay at Eastern for fully accredited &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; was about $65,000, he said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.429109398698947  \\n   The chairman of Texas Air Corp. Friday defended a decision by the company\\'s subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, to lay off 4,000 &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; and cut &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; as a way to ``stabilize the company\\'\\' by cutting losses. Frank Lorenzo, testifying at a federal court hearing on Eastern\\'s plans to eliminate &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; to 14 cities, said the layoffs and schedule changes were a necessary step to save the financially troubled carrier. ``If Eastern\\'s management is not permitted to take the actions to save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,\\'\\' Lorenzo said, rejecting suggestions by &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; attorneys that he was trying to bust organized &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; at Eastern by transferring the carrier\\'s assets to Continental Airlines, another Texas Air property. Three &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; unions &lt;/b&gt; that represent Eastern &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; have challenged the plans and obtained a temporary restraining order that bars the &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; from making layoffs. U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker is holding hearings on the union\\'s bid for a permanent injunction. Lorenzo defended the proposed cutbacks ``as an attempt to stabilize the company ... and decrease the losses.\\'\\' Eastern currently is in federally supervised contract negotiations with two of its unions, the Association of Air Line Pilots and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Lorenzo denied suggestions that Texas Air planned to merge Eastern\\'s operations into Continental. Union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that Lorenzo was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air had purchased Eastern. The draft said that the purchase of Eastern gave Texas Air leverage over the unions. ``Eastern\\'s airplanes can be repainted and moved over to Continental where they will be flown by non-union pilots,\\'\\' the speech draft said. But Lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking firm. It was unclear from the testimony if Lorenzo ever delivered that portion of the speech. &lt;/p&gt; 0.40322963681166  \\n   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it has canceled its contract with Orion Air Inc. to provide strike-replacement pilots, but pledged to remain flying in the event of &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; troubles. Eastern, preparing for tough negotiations with the Machinists &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; on its expiring &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; pact, had contracted with Orion in case its own &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; refused to cross picket lines, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. But U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington ruled in March that the deal with Orion violated the existing contract between Eastern and its &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; union. Replacements cannot be trained until a strike begins, the judge said. Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., is one of the largest U.S. operators of aircraft for the small package industry. Miami-based Eastern, the nation\\'s sixth-largest airline, is a subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp. The Transport Workers Union filed a similar suit in April, accusing Eastern of using its planes to train Orion &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants to break a strike. Ms. Ceremsak refused to attribute the cancellation of the Orion contract to Eastern\\'s legal setbacks, however. The contract was terminated ``for sound business reasons,\\'\\' said Ms. Ceremsak. ``Beyond that I can\\'t elaborate.\\'\\' The decision to end the contract does not mean that financially troubled Eastern will shut down if the Machinists walk out, the spokeswoman said. ``We do have plans to operate in case of a strike,\\'\\' she said. ``But our first priority is still reaching a settlement\\'\\' with the Machinists. J.B. Stokes, a spokesman for the &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; at Eastern, said the federal court decisions against Eastern left the carrier with no choice. ``This is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey court orders,\\'\\' said Stokes. ``The judge said you cannot train (replacement) &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; in any capacity until such time as there is a strike.\\'\\' The cancellation will cost Eastern about $5.5 million under a provision of the Orion contract, Stokes said. Ms. Ceremsak refused to comment on any provisions of the contract or its cancellation. &lt;/p&gt; 0.386984049004294  \\n   The obscure cargo &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; that Eastern Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces questions about its safety record as the government decides whether it is fit to carry passengers. Few &lt;b&gt; air &lt;/b&gt; travelers have ever heard of Orion Air, a North Carolina cargo carrier which serves such &lt;b&gt; air &lt;/b&gt; freight companies as United Parcel Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator. But if &lt;b&gt; labor &lt;/b&gt; strife intensifies at Eastern, many of that airline\\'s customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion _ and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up scrutiny of the airline. Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion, including the leasing of 26 of Eastern\\'s jetliners, that call on the &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; to take over much of Eastern\\'s routes if &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; and mechanics go on strike. Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; and ground workers, Eastern officials said. But the FAA has yet to approve Orion for passenger service, and a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against Orion because of past safety violations. An FAA inspection report on Orion shows ``a large number of serious safety infractions,\\'\\' said Anthony Broderick, the FAA\\'s associate administrator for aviation standards. Broderick said the airline\\'s management has taken actions ``to permit Orion to safely operate its cargo business\\'\\' and training and maintenance procedures ``are being corrected to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\\'\\' At congressional hearings Tuesday, James L. Heffernan, an Orion vice president, said problems cited by the FAA have been corrected. Heffernan called Orion\\'s safety record excellent and maintained that much of the FAA\\'s concerns stemmed from a ``misunderstanding\\'\\' by FAA inspectors about Orion\\'s method of record keeping. ``Orion Air responded to each of the FAA\\'s proposed findings last summer and are still in the process of resolving these issues. Obviously, if any of the issues compromised &lt;b&gt; air &lt;/b&gt; safety, the FAA would not have allowed Orion Air to continue to operate,\\'\\' Heffernan continued. But Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairman of the House government operations and transportation subcommittee, called Orion ``an &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; in near-shambles\\'\\' and raised questions about its fitness to fly passengers. In an interview, Steven Kolski, a vice president of Eastern, said Eastern executives believe Orion\\'s past safety problems have been resolved. He expressed confidence that the airline\\'s fitness will be assured before the FAA allows it to engage in passenger-carrying flights. ``We got a report that said they (Orion) are a hell of a lot better today than they were a year ago and that most, if not all, of their problems were behind them and they were in good shape,\\'\\' said Kolski. Kolski said Eastern is relying on the agreement with Orion to keep Eastern\\'s &lt;b&gt; service &lt;/b&gt; going if its 10,000 mechanics go on strike and its 4,000 &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; refuse to cross the picket lines. But FAA officials were not as certain that all of Orion\\'s safety shortcomings are behind it. The FAA cited ``systemic difficulties\\'\\' with the airline\\'s training program, record keeping and use of operational handbooks that are not yet corrected. And the agency disclosed it was seeking civil penalties against Orion for past violations, although no amounts were cited. ``Once the systemic problems have all been corrected, the FAA will turn its attention toward developing an appropriate enforcement package, including a proposed fine\\'\\' for past violations, Broderick said. Orion\\'s problems stem from safety violations found in early 1987 _ violations that attracted little public attention because Orion\\'s 55 jets were carrying only cargo. Among the findings by FAA inspectors were a shortage of required training records; inadequate auditing of maintenance facilites; poor documentation on the qualifications of ``check pilots\\'\\' who decide on the performance of line pilots; incomplete &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; operations manuals, instances of &lt;b&gt; pilots &lt;/b&gt; failing to go through required refresher training; and training programs that did not meet federal standards. In a related development Tuesday, the FAA made public a report on improvements Eastern Airlines has made in its own maintenance program since the &lt;b&gt; airline &lt;/b&gt; was fined a record $9.5 million two years ago. The FAA said that Eastern has made ``substantial progress\\'\\' to correct past deficiencies, but that some concerns remain about the airline\\'s deferred maintenance program and repeated problems with certain equipment. Nevertheless, Eastern officials hailed the latest FAA findings which showed that corrective actions had been taken in 52 of the 53 areas cited by the FAA two years ago. ``We are very pleased. This report shows that Eastern has corrected the deficiencies,\\'\\' said Kolski. &lt;/p&gt; 0.34912563695709  \\n   Northwest Airlines is offering &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants two free first-class tickets anywhere in the world for reporting as scheduled for holiday duty. It\\'s an attempt to cut down on sick calls over the holidays. In a recent letter to workers, Northwest in-flight services chief Lloyd Warren thanked &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants in advance for reporting for holiday duty. And as ``a token of our thanks,\\'\\' Warren said, two free round-trip tickets in first-class seating would be given to &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants who report as scheduled between Dec. 15 and Jan. 1. Northwest employs more than 8,000 &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants. To qualify, workers must be scheduled for flights on Dec. 24, Dec. 25, Dec. 31 or Jan. 1. Service charges that normally accompany worker flight-pass privileges would be waived. Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said that last year, &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants were offered a $100 cash bonus for working through the holidays. Miller said the offer does not reflect a problem with holiday sick leave in the ranks of &lt;b&gt; flight &lt;/b&gt; attendants. ``It\\'s just that when we\\'re in crunch time like we are around the holidays, every single person is key to our success,\\'\\' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  mrs family hospital wife children son mother home life husband medical daughter father child heart condition center died surgery woman &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.609962531058814  \\n   Loma Linda Medical Center said Friday has accepted a fourth baby born with most of his brain missing and will keep it alive for up to a week in hopes that its organs can be used for transplant. The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified Southern California &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; Thursday and transferred to Loma Linda University Medical Center, said Anita Rockwell, a spokeswoman for the center. Baby D suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is missing. The &lt;b&gt; condition &lt;/b&gt; almost always leads to death within days or weeks. ``His parents want to donate their baby\\'s organs when brain death occurs,\\'\\' Rockwell said. Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda chief of neonatology, said Baby D was resting comfortably Friday and receiving nutrition and water as needed. Rockwell said the newborn will be cared for for a seven-day period that began Thursday night. Under Loma Linda policy, Baby D will be placed on &lt;b&gt; life &lt;/b&gt; support if needed to prevent damage to organs. If Baby D is declared brain-dead within seven days, the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; will give notice that his organs are available for transplant. If he isn\\'t brain dead within seven days, he will be allowed to die. The time limit was developed to alleviate ethical concerns that doomed anencephalics not be kept alive indefinitely merely so their organs can be donated. Rockwell said anonymity was requested by Baby D\\'s parents and officials of the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; where he was born. Baby D is the fourth anencephalic newborn accepted as a possible organ donor at the hospital. The first was stillborn Dec. 23, thwarting her parents\\' desire to have her major organs donated. Her corneas and &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; valves were given to infants needing them. The second anencephalic was declared brain-dead Feb. 18. Attempts to donate his liver failed because potential recipients either weren\\'t suitable matches or couldn\\'t be operated on in time. He was disconnected from life-support Feb. 20. Most recently, a girl was transferred to Loma Linda after birth Feb. 20. Because she never met brain-death criteria within the seven-day limit, she was disconnected from a respirator and allowed to die on Feb. 28. However, her eyes, corneas and &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; valves were later donated to infants needing organs. Loma Linda gained worldwide attention in 1984 when Dr. Leonard Bailey, frustrated at the lack of &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; donors for babies, transplanted a baboon\\'s &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; into a girl known as Baby Fae. She &lt;b&gt; died &lt;/b&gt; 20{ days later. Bailey, whose baboon transplant was sharply criticized by many doctors, subsequently urged the use of anencephalics as donors of hearts and other organs. &lt;/p&gt; 0.53641965260323  \\n   Police on Friday sought a 12-year-old girl needing &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; surgery &lt;/b&gt; and her mother, who authorities said abducted the girl from a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; because the woman\\'s religion forbids blood transfusions. The girl, Kimberly Winfield, was believed to have left Children\\'s Memorial Hospital about 1 a.m. Thursday, said police Lt. Edmund Beazley. The mother, Caroline Winfield, called relatives to say she wanted to return her daughter, said Dave Schneidman, spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. But she was afraid to surrender for fear of being prosecuted. Police obtained an arrest warrant for the 35-year-old &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; on a charge of &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; abduction because Kimberly is a ward of the state, Beazley said. ``We\\'re not real interested in catching the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; if she doesn\\'t want to be caught, but we do want the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; back so we can save the child\\'s life,\\'\\' Schneidman said. Police and the state Department of Children and Family Services said they were reasonably certain the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; was responsible for the child\\'s disappearance. ``There doesn\\'t seem to be any doubt of it right now,\\'\\' Beazley said. ``Before the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; was discovered missing, the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; had told relatives that she was going to take the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; from the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; because she did not approve of the surgery,\\'\\' said department spokesman Schneidman. Schneidman said the &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; needed open-heart &lt;b&gt; surgery &lt;/b&gt; to survive. ``The prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live without the surgery,\\'\\' he said. However, Children\\'s Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Jan Benzies said Kimberly, who was admitted Wednesday, was not critically ill. ``She was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; problem,\\'\\' the spokeswoman said. ``Her doctor does not believe her &lt;b&gt; life &lt;/b&gt; is in immediate danger. ``However, it is clinically advisable that she be located and treated within a month,\\'\\' she said. No one at the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; saw the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt; child &lt;/b&gt; leave, Beazley said. ``Apparently, she just got her dressed and walked out,\\'\\' he said. ``They were allowing the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; to stay in the room with her, which is pretty common with young children. The nurse came back to check on them and they were both gone.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; is a Jehovah\\'s Witness, Beazley said. Jehovah\\'s Witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against the teachings of the Bible. ``You can\\'t do &lt;b&gt; surgery &lt;/b&gt; without a transfusion of blood,\\'\\' Schneidman said. The Department of Children and Family Services waited about 34 hours after the disappearance to notify the press so police could check leads on Winfield\\'s whereabouts, Schneidman said. Those leads were exhausted, he said. The agency was named temporary custodian of Kimberly and two brothers, ages 2 and 8, about a month ago because Winfield was unable to care for them, Schneidman said. ``They were living on the streets without proper housing or any evident means of support,\\'\\' Schneidman said. The boys, whose names were not released, are now living with their paternal grandmother in Chicago, Beazley said. A department caseworker noticed Kimberly was ill and took her to the hospital, Schneidman said. Larry Winfield, Kimberly\\'s father, had been notified and was very concerned, Schneidman said. He maintains a permanent residence and is employed, but the &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; have not lived with him for some time, Schneidman said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.451325934329735  \\n   Do all things get cheaper by the dozen _ even children? Things are starting out that way for Vicki and Stephen Kesler. Valley View Hospital, where Mrs. Kesler had delivered six of her most recent children, provided its services free when she went there for her 12th. The child, Breanne Marie, was born in July. ``I thought it would be nice to do something for them because they had supported us so much over the years by having their &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; here,\\'\\' said John Johnson, the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; administrator. Betty Mahan, a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; spokeswoman, said Saturday she did not know how much the free services were worth. The couple have lived in Rifle, in western Colorado, for 10 years. He is an engineer and she is a homemaker. Mrs. Kesler said that anytime she has to fill out a form that asks about her employment, she writes, ``The Kesler home, as &lt;b&gt; mother &lt;/b&gt; of 12. That should be sufficient.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; range to age 19. &lt;/p&gt; 0.440049487043078  \\n   Dennis Day, the Irish tenor of radio and television fame, was sent &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; Monday from St. John\\'s Hospital and Health Center, although he remains in critical condition, a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; spokesman said. ``According to his physician, he was discharged because his care can be continued in a &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; setting,\\'\\' said Armen Markarian, a &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; spokesman. ``He\\'s surrounded by his &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; there, and he\\'ll be more comfortable in a &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; setting.\\'\\' Day was admitted to Saint John\\'s on June 5, and continues to suffer from a recurrence of pressure on the brain, publicist Kitty Davis said. The 71-year-old singer was diagnosed last summer as suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressively degenerative nerve disorder also known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease. On March 9, Day suffered a head injury in a fall at his Bel Air home, and underwent emergency treatment to relieve the pressure caused by bleeding in the brain. He remained in the &lt;b&gt; hospital &lt;/b&gt; until April 12, Markarian said. Day appeared regularly with comedian Jack Benny on radio and television as well as in films. Born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York, he assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny\\'s radio show as a singer in 1939 and quickly grew into a comic foil for the host. &lt;/p&gt; 0.385973013595312  \\n   When Ron Thompson sat down for lunch on New Year\\'s Eve, he was the grandfather of five. At breakfast Monday, he was a grandfather of nine. Three of Thompson\\'s daughters _ Mary Tolson, Joan Thompson and Carol Thompson _ gave birth to four boys at Seton Medical Center late Sunday and early Monday. When Ms. Tolson went into labor Sunday, she asked her 19-year-old sister Joan, who was in the ninth month of her pregnancy, to drive her to the hospital. After about five hours, Ms. Tolson, 28, gave birth at 2:40 p.m. to Shane Taylor Tolson, who weighed 7 pounds 9 ounces. At Ms. Tolson\\'s delivery, Dr. Chris Seeker said Joan told him, ``You will probably be seeing me, too.\\'\\' Sure enough, seven hours later Joan was hustled to Seton by sister Carol. Joan gave birth to Jeremy Andrew Thompson Armendariz at 12:01 a.m. He weighed 6 pounds 10 ounces.

Lang teamed with Dr. William Pelham of the University of Pittsburgh to conduct the research. ``Our studies show how the destructive role of alcohol in parent-child interactions is a two-way street,\\'\\' Lang said. ``Problem drinkers make &lt;b&gt; poor &lt;/b&gt; parents, but problem &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; may also drive &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; to drink.\\'\\' He said the findings are similar to those of studies that show &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; who are mentally retarded or have serious behavioral problems are abused more often than normal, obedient children. ``The point is that while we usually think of &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; as influencers of children, &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; can affect &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; as well,\\'\\' Lang said. ``And the outcome is not always favorable.\\'\\' Dr. Robin Room, scientific director of the Alchohol Research Group of the Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, wasn\\'t surprised by the findings but said it was important to look into the cause of drinking among parents, ``rather than give in to the bumper sticker-type humor that says &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; cause their &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; to drink. ``It\\'s important to understand that parental drinking patterns can later influence their children\\'s drinking patterns,\\'\\' Room said. The Florida researchers, under a grant from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked 120 &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; with 5-to-12-year-old sons to interact with an unfamiliar boy of a similar age. The &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; were then given an opportunity to drink as much or as little alcohol as they wanted, while anticipating a second interaction with the same child. Half of the &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; in the study had difficult &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; of their own with short attention spans, hyperactivity, conduct disorders, or some combination of the three. The other half had only &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; without behavior disorders. But the researchers stacked the deck. Half the &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; had initially interacted with boys who behaved normally, while half had faced boys trained by the researchers to behave in an overactive and disruptive way. Among &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; of normal children, those who interacted with disruptive boys drank one-third more than those who interacted with a cooperative child. ``I feel justified in suggesting that these results indicate that drinking is a parental behavior that can be influenced by the characteristics and behaviors of children,\\'\\' Lang said. Parents with disruptive &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; at &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; responded differently to the study, however, depending on the drinking patterns of their own parents. Those who had a &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; history of drinking problems drank 50 percent more after interacting with a deviant child-actor, while those with no such &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; history drank less. ``This suggests that &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; differ in their vulnerability to increased drinking in response to the stress of interactions with a difficult child,\\'\\' Lang said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.488623675412384  \\n   Overweight &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; have greater long-term success controlling their weight if their &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; provide early support for exercising and eating right, researchers said. Ten years after participating in a weight-loss program as 6- to 12-year-olds, &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; whose &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; got similar weight-control training were significantly less obese than those whose &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; received less training, according to a study published in Wednesday\\'s Journal of the American Medical Association. ``We think the important finding is in the modeling,\\'\\' said psychologist Leonard H. Epstein, head of the University of Pittsburgh\\'s Childhood Obesity Clinic and leader of the research team. ``If you have &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; who you don\\'t want to eat potato chips, you can\\'t sit in front of them eating Ho-Hos.\\'\\' Epstein\\'s &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; also concluded that pre-adolescent weight loss had no effect on height development, contrary to the findings of several shorter-term studies. Two other childhood obesity experts called Epstein\\'s results surprisin because previous research has shown that fat &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; will grow into fat adults and that weight lost in treatment programs is quickly regained. Those experts said further study was needed on whether treatment of obesity in childhood can produce effects that persist into young adulthood. In Epstein\\'s project, an initial &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; of 75 obese &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; and their &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; were randomly assigned to three groups. Study criteria required the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; be more than 20 percent over ideal weight for their age, height and sex; both &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; at home, one of whom had to be obese; and one parent willing to attend treatment meetings with their child. All subjects were to attend eight weekly treatment meetings followed by six monthly meetings, then by 21-month, five-year and 10-year meetings. All were instructed to follow a regimen that included a 1,200-to-1,500-calorie-per-day diet and an aerobic exercise program. In the first group, both &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; received reinforcement for losing weight and were trained to praise other &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; members for changing eating and exercise habits. In the second group, only the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; received reinforcement for losing weight but were similarly trained to praise &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; members for weight-control behaviors. Parents and &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; in the third &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; received reinforcement only for attending the meetings. They received information about social reinforcement without specific training in how to use the method. All subjects lost weight initially. At the 10-year mark, the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; in the first &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; were, on average, 7.5 percent less overweight than at the beginning of the study while those in the second and third groups were 4.5 percent and 14.3 percent fatter, respectively. Parents in all three groups were more obese after 10 years than at the start of the study. In a journal editorial, Dr. Albert J. Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania medical school and Dr. Robert I. Berkowitz of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic cautioned that the ``treatment did not prevent obesity, it limited it.\\'\\' They called Epstein\\'s results surprising, perhaps because of his relatively small study sample: intact, middle-class &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; in which the &lt;b&gt; parents &lt;/b&gt; were likely to be very supportive of their children\\'s efforts. They said replication of Epstein\\'s study ``is clearly needed\\'\\' before the findings can be embraced. &lt;/p&gt; 0.444631427012752  \\n   Amid the frozen farm fields of Iowa, Judy Shelly answered a cry for help from a small wooden garage.

As farmers lose their land, small-town factories shut their doors and &lt;b&gt; housing &lt;/b&gt; costs rise, growing numbers of &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; folks are joining the ranks of the nation\\'s homeless. ``Rural &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are everywhere around us,\\'\\' said Louisa Stark, president of the National Coalition for the Homeless. ``They\\'re &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in barns and chicken coops. They\\'re doubled and tripled up with &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; and friends. They\\'re &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; under trees or, in some cases, sleeping in caves.\\'\\' Garages, too. The Iowa &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; had rented a nearby &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; after losing their farm last winter, but when the pipes burst and the landlord couldn\\'t afford repairs, they moved into the garage because it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater. Shelly, who works for a farmers-assistance group, helped find them a place to stay. They moved on shortly after. People think &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; America ``has been able to stand on its own two feet ever since the Depression,\\'\\' Shelly said. ``(They think) somehow they\\'ll get by. They think you have the white picket fence, mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids. That\\'s not the way it is. ``The reality is &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; life and &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; life are not much different anymore,\\'\\' she added. ``We have &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; going without food. We have &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; going without heat.\\'\\' And &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; going without roofs over their heads. Up to 3 million Americans are homeless, the national coalition says. Some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; areas, but nobody knows for sure because they aren\\'t as conspicious as &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; panhandling on &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; streets or sleeping on grates. ``Everybody calls the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; invisible. In fact, they are,\\'\\' said Melanie Roth of the Housing Assistance Council in Washington, D.C., which deals with &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; low-income &lt;b&gt; housing &lt;/b&gt; needs. ``They don\\'t wander the streets of small-town America,\\'\\' said Keith Luebke, co-director of the Welcome Inn Transitional Living Center in Mankato, Minn. ``They leave or they somehow hide themselves or hide their problems. They don\\'t want anyone to know.\\'\\' Most of the newest &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; are working &lt;b&gt; poor &lt;/b&gt; and farm families, says a report by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences. Compared with their &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; counterparts, the report says, they\\'re younger &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; dependent on two incomes; typically, one wage-earner loses a job and the remaining income isn\\'t enough to pay the rent. They most often live in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled industries. These &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; face a Hobson\\'s choice of moving in with friends or relatives _ or pulling up roots and leaving. The institute\\'s report said some &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; areas have a five-year waiting list for public housing. Though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities, the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; get much less help _ fewer shelters, fewer soup kitchens, less money from charities. ``In short, the faint voice that has recently been given to the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; America has been denied the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; America,\\'\\' said a national coalition study on such problems in Appalachia and the South. Several studies have examined &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; homelessness. Among the findings: _ More than three-quarters of community agencies responding to a Housing Assistance Council survey last year reported increases in &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; from 1981-82 to 1986-87. Of those, 38 percent said the increase was significant. _ In Ohio, the proportion of women among the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; was twice that of &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; populations, according to a 1985 study. That\\'s partly due to the higher percentage of married &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; among the &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; homeless, 18.5 percent against 6.7 percent married among &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; homeless. _ In Minnesota, 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; centers had jobs, compared with 24 percent in &lt;b&gt; urban &lt;/b&gt; Minneapolis, said a 1988 study by the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless. _ In Iowa, a study found one of the larger groups in danger of losing &lt;b&gt; homes &lt;/b&gt; was farm widows, many of whom live on just a few hundred dollars a month. The count of &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; should also include &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; who live in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family, a common arrangement among down-and-out farmers, the experts say. It may be 21 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in one house, nine &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; and three adults squeezed in a trailer or a &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; so crowded they sleep in shifts. ``You have &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; on top of each other. Those are the hidden homeless,\\'\\' said Luebke. ``These &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; no longer have their own &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; or apartment. They have a roof over their head, but in real terms they should be considered homeless.\\'\\' Living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies say it\\'s tantamount to being homeless. ``When &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have a &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; where the roof is constantly leaking and the cold air can come in ... (and) there\\'s no money to fix those things, that\\'s not a home,\\'\\' said Norma Dell, director of Bethany House, a Kentucky social service center. Agencies around the country have files on &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in rat-infested shanties, rotting houses without walls or shacks without heat, water or toilets. Others describe a wheelchair-bound man &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; under a bridge after being evicted, an Indian &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough, a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator. Stark said she\\'s heard reports from California of farmworkers &lt;b&gt; living &lt;/b&gt; in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves. &lt;/p&gt; 0.408340774464199  \\n   Frustration over having to draw up an unemotional report on the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; and then go into streets where &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were ``ravaging garbage cans\\'\\' prompted dissent by most of the report\\'s authors, one of them said today. Phyllis Wolfe, executive director of a private health &lt;b&gt; care &lt;/b&gt; program for the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; in the nation\\'s capital, said that while gathering information for the report, panel members became outraged at conditions they found. ``It could just not be left in dots and dashes and graphs and figures,\\'\\' Ms. Wolfe said on ``CBS This Morning.\\'\\' Ms. Wolfe joined eight other members of the committee formed by the National Academy of Sciences\\' Institute of Medicine in issuing a supplementary statement that the institute refused to include in its report published Monday. The published report, ``Homelessness, Health and Human Needs,\\'\\' calls the growing number of &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; ``a national disgrace.\\'\\' It recommends such measures as changing food stamp programs, increasing Medicaid services and expanding programs that help pre-school children. The authors of the supplementary statement said recommendations in the report were too limited. They said the country should supply more low-income housing, raise the minimum wage, offer more support services and guarantee &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; adequate health care. Nine members of the 13-member panel signed the supplementary statement saying the main study ``fails to capture our sense of shame and anger about homelessness.\\'\\' The original report estimates that &lt;b&gt; families &lt;/b&gt; with a total of 100,000 &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; are &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; on any given night, in addition to countless &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; who have run away from &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; or been kicked out by their parents. It says those under 18 are the fastest growing &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; group, and homelessness is increasing in many &lt;b&gt; rural &lt;/b&gt; areas as well as in the nation\\'s cities. Ms. Wolfe said the committee\\'s work on the report was ``very structured,\\'\\' but members found themselves ``leaving committee meetings and walking by and seeing &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; ravaging garbage cans, seeing &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; suffering on the street.\\'\\' The supplementary statement itself expresses the same sentiment: ``We have reviewed the demographic and clinical data and then, walking home, passed men asleep on heating grates or displaced &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; energetically searching in garbage piles for a few cents\\' income from aluminum cans,\\'\\' it says. ``We analyzed mortality data for the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; but lacked any platform from which to shout that our neighbors are dying needlessly because we are incapable of providing the most basic services.\\'\\' ``We can no longer sit as spectators to the elderly &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; dying of hypothermia, to the &lt;b&gt; children &lt;/b&gt; with blighted futures poisoned by lead in rat-infested dilapidated welfare hotels, to women raped, to old men beaten and robbed of their few possessions, and to pepole dying on the streets with catastrophic illness such as AIDS,\\'\\' the supplementary report said. It said the committee members who dissented against the report\\'s limited nature endorsed its long list of recommendations, but ``felt continuously uneasy because of our inability to state the most basic recommendation: homelessness in the United States is an inexcusable disgrace and must be eliminated.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.394652789863667  \\n   Hours after three &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were evicted from one boarded-up &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, they moved into another unoccupied HUD house, officials said. The three are members of the Union for the Homeless, and HUD spokesman Ken Barnard accused them of seeking publicity. Police evicted Clotilde Lewis, 36, Duwayne Jackson, 39, and Floretta Logan, 27, from the first &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday afternoon. Homeless Union members had helped them break into the &lt;b&gt; home &lt;/b&gt; on Saturday. Lewis was handcuffed and taken to a police station when she refused to leave the first &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; but was released without being charged. Barnard said the three were trespassing in a &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; bought by a &lt;b&gt; family &lt;/b&gt; that planned to move in later in the week. Hours after their eviction, the three settled into a boarded-up four-bedroom &lt;b&gt; house &lt;/b&gt; with three kerosene heaters, clothes and hamburgers from a fast-food restaurant. They remained there early today while officials considered whether to arrest them and file trespassing charges, said William Harris, deputy director of the Detroit HUD office. Wayne Pippin, president of the Union for the Homeless, said after the eviction Tuesday that HUD owns many vacant &lt;b&gt; homes &lt;/b&gt; and ``should be ashamed to kick someone out of this home, which is needed so badly.\\'\\' Jackson, unemployed after working at odd jobs, said &lt;b&gt; housing &lt;/b&gt; is difficult to find on $150 a month from public assistance. ``This is a major emergency situation,\\'\\' said Sally Pattee, a &lt;b&gt; group &lt;/b&gt; spokeswoman. ``The temporary shelters have been full since July. When &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; need temporary shelter, they need it now.\\'\\' Barnard said HUD makes its properties available to the &lt;b&gt; homeless &lt;/b&gt; through organizations such as the Detroit Non-profit Housing Coalition. HUD obtains houses when buyers default on government-backed mortgages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  court case judge ruling supreme state appeals decision lawyers federal ruled rights appeal cases order legal law civil lawyer courts &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.712545268792383  \\n   The Supreme Court today let stand a $3.5 million punitive-damages award won by a San Diego gas station operator against Atlantic Richfield Co. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the second largest of its kind ever upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. John V. Nielsen had operated an ARCO station as an independent dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station to a mini-market and self-service station in 1979. His lawsuit charged ARCO with fraudulently misrepresenting facts in connection with the conversion of his station. A &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; jury awarded Nielsen $525,788 in compensatory damages _ $79,061 in out-of-pocket losses, $396,727 in lost anticipated profits and $50,000 for emotional distress. The jury also awarded him $3.5 million in punitive damages against ARCO. A &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; upheld the award except for the emotional-distress damages, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear ARCO\\'s appeal. In the &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; acted on today, &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; for ARCO argued that the huge punitive-damages award _ seven times the compensatory-damages award _ violates the Eighth Amendment\\'s ban on ``excessive fines.\\'\\' No &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; has ever applied that constitutional principle to non-criminal cases. The Supreme Court in May passed up deciding in a Mississippi &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; whether the constitutional ban on ``excessive fines\\'\\' can be applied to personal-injury lawsuits. Some &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury lawsuits. Lawyers for ARCO urged the justices to ``send a clear signal that the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; courts &lt;/b&gt; must stop these gargantuan awards.\\'\\' But &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; for Nielsen argued that the ARCO &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; should not be granted because the oil company\\'s &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; had not raised the ``excessive fines\\'\\' argument in &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; courts. The justices refused to address the punitive-damages issue in the Mississippi &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; decided earlier this month after noting that it had not been raised in &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; courts. ARCO\\'s &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; did not challenge the $475,000 compensatory-damages award won by Nielsen. The &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; is Atlantic Richfield vs. Nielsen, 87-1196. &lt;/p&gt; 0.54935381321369  \\n   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a $550,000 award won, and then lost, by a Texas couple whose daughter was born with deformities after her mother took the anti-nausea drug Bendectin. The justices, without comment, let stand a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; that overturned a jury award against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the drug\\'s manufacturer. Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Brock of Moscow, Texas, sued Merrell Dow after their daughter, Rachel, was born with deformed limbs in 1982. A three-member panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out the $550,000 judgment a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; trial jury had awarded the Brocks. The &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said there is no definitive scientific proof that Bendectin causes birth defects, and said the jury award was based on speculation. ``Speculation unconfirmed by ... proof cannot form the basis for causation in a &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; of law,\\'\\' the &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said. The full 5th Circuit court, by a 8-6 vote, refused to review the three-member panel\\'s ruling. The dissenters noted that six experts testified for the Brocks that Bendectin is capable of causing birth defects, and that three testified they believed the drug caused Rachel\\'s deformities. The dissenting judges said appellate &lt;b&gt; courts &lt;/b&gt; should not substitute their understanding of the facts for that of a jury merely because medical experts disagree. Bendectin was marketed by Richardson-Merrell Inc. between 1957 and 1983. More than 30 million women used the drug during pregnancy. Richardson-Merrell later became Merrell Dow, which last July merged with Marion Laboratories Inc. and became Marion Merrell Dow Inc., based in Kansas City. The company stopped selling Bendectin 1983, although the Federal Drug Administration never has rescinded approval of it. Merrell Dow in 1984 agreed to pay $120 million to more than 800 families to compensate children with birth defects allegedly caused by Bendectin. As part of the settlement, the corporation did not admit that the drug caused the defects. The settlement was rejected by a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; court, and the lawsuits then went to a consolidated trial in Ohio, where Merrell Dow has its headquarters in Hamilton County. After a 22-day trial in 1985, an Ohio jury found that Bendectin did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses. The &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; acted on today is Brock vs. Merrell Dow, 89-1189. &lt;/p&gt; 0.525270540212575  \\n   California\\'s &lt;b&gt; civil &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; commission may not award damages for emotional distress or other personal harm caused by job discrimination, the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Supreme Court &lt;b&gt; ruled &lt;/b&gt; today. The 5-2 &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; eliminates the Fair Employment and Housing Commission\\'s ability to &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; damages for bias victims who commonly suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation caused by employers\\' mistreatment. Those victims of sexual or racial harassment could still go to &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; and sue for a full range of damages. But suits are available only to those who can afford a lawyer. The &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said the commission was authorized only to &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; back pay and reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require employers to take steps to prevent future discrimination. In a separate &lt;b&gt; decision &lt;/b&gt; today, the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said discrimination victims were not required to file claims with the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; before suing in court. The rulings come three years after the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; prohibited the same commission from awarding punitive damages in flagrant &lt;b&gt; cases &lt;/b&gt; of job discrimination. In that time, the Legislature has passed bills establishing the commission\\'s authority to award both kinds of damages, but Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed them. Today\\'s &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; was based on an interpretation of current &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; law &lt;/b&gt; and left open the possibility that the Legislature could pass a new &lt;b&gt; law &lt;/b&gt; allowing the commission to award damages. But the opinion by Justice Edward Panelli hinted that unlimited damage awards by the commission, even if authorized by &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; law, might be found unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a jury trial. A jury in a &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; ``is in the best position to determine just compensation for emotional and mental distress,\\'\\' Panelli wrote. The &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; overturned a $20,000 damage award by the commission to Rose Brown, a secretary for the Peralta Community College District in Oakland. She claimed she was fired in April 1981 for refusing sexual advances by an administrator at Laney College. &lt;/p&gt; 0.515448070132596  \\n   The Supreme Court today strengthened the right of criminal suspects to have &lt;b&gt; lawyers &lt;/b&gt; present when they are questioned by police. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned the murder conviction of Mississippi death row inmate Robert S. Minnick, who confessed when he was questioned without his &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; present. The &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said Minnick\\'s &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; were violated even though he earlier had consulted with his &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; and agreed to talk to authorities. Unless the suspect initiates such a talk with police, the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said, he may not be questioned outside the presence of his &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; once he has invoked his right to a lawyer. In other action, the court: - Left intact a lawsuit settlement that eased restrictions on abortion clinics in Illinois. The court, without comment, rejected an &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; by two nurses and two expectant fathers who said the settlement does not adequately protect women or fetuses. - Refused to kill a lawsuit against a California community college\\'s officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the on-campus performance of a racially charged play. The court, without comment, rejected an &lt;b&gt; appeal &lt;/b&gt; by the college officials. - Shielded businesses from some big-money lawsuits filed by employees who claim they were fired so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits. The &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; ruled &lt;/b&gt; unanimously that fired employees may not sue4 in &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; courts &lt;/b&gt; over such allegations. The &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; suits are pre-empted by a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; law &lt;/b&gt; protecting pensions, the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; said. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; in the confession case, said, ``There can be no doubt that the interrogation in question was initiated by the police. It was a formal interview which (Minnick) was compelled to attend.\\'\\' ``Since (Minnick) made a specific request for counsel before the interview, the police-initiated interrogation was impermissible.\\'\\' In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority was ``misguided\\'\\' to discourage ``an honest confession.\\'\\' He said the &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; undermines a ``belief in either personal responsibility or the moral claim of just government to obedience.\\'\\' He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case. Minnick and James ``Monkey\\'\\' Dyess escaped from Clarke County, Miss., jail in April 1986 and went looking for guns, authorities said. Police said the two men fatally shot Donald Ellis Thomas and Lamar Lafferty when the victims returned to Thomas\\'s mobile home to find Minnick and Dyess there. Minnick was arrested in Lemon Grove, Calif., on Aug. 22, 1986. FBI agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a lawyer. Minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to answer any more questions. A few days later, Deputy Sheriff J.C. Denham of Clarke County flew to California and questioned Minnick. The suspect confessed, saying he shot Lafferty because Dyess was threatening to kill Minnick if he did not. Minnick was convicted in Mississippi and sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court, in upholding his conviction, said Denham\\'s questioning of Minnick did not violate a rule the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1981. The high &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; barred police from questioning a suspect who has asked for a &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; unless the suspect initiates the conversation. Today the high &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; extended that &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; to instances in which a suspect already has conferred with an attorney. Kennedy said the 1981 &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; is designed to prevent police from badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a &lt;b&gt; lawyer &lt;/b&gt; provided by the court\\'s famous Miranda &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; in 1966. The threat of badgering is no less after the suspect has talked to his lawyer, Kennedy said. ``A single consultation with an attorney does not remove the suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to waive his &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; or from the coercive pressures that accompany custody and that may increase as custody is prolonged,\\'\\' he said. The &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; is Minnick vs. Mississippi, 89-6332. &lt;/p&gt; 0.509516901330661  \\n   The Supreme Court today reinstated a $6.1 million award against the Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting firm won by investors in the Farmer\\'s Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The justices, by a 5-4 vote, &lt;b&gt; ruled &lt;/b&gt; that the promissory notes held by the co-op\\'s investors are ``securities\\'\\' as defined by &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; law. A &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; appeals &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; court &lt;/b&gt; had thrown out the award after &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; that the notes were not securities. Sold for many years by the co-op to thousands of farmers, the notes were uninsured, payable on demand and yielded only interest. When the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984, about 1,600 of its 23,000 members held notes they had purchased for more than $10 million. Among other &lt;b&gt; legal &lt;/b&gt; actions, investors filed a ``class action\\'\\' lawsuit against Arthur Young &amp; Co., which had audited the co-op\\'s 1981 and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those statements. The suit alleged that the accounting firm fraudulently had misled investors about the co-op\\'s financial strength, in violation of a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; security law\\'s anti-fraud provisions. A &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; jury awarded the investors about $6.1 million in compensatory damages, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award when &lt;b&gt; ruling &lt;/b&gt; that the notes were not securities. In disagreeing with the 8th Circuit court, Justice Thurgood Marshall noted ``Congress\\' broader purpose ... of ensuring that investments of all descriptions be regulated to prevent fraud and abuse.\\'\\' He was joined by Justices William J.

The &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; seized in Monday\\'s operation near Colombia\\'s northern coast was hidden among cargo bags and ready to be exported to the United States, said regional army commander Col. Carlos Castro. He said troops destroyed six cocaine-processing laboratories, &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; 103 suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers and found nearly 5,000 acres of coca leaf, the raw material used to make cocaine. Soldiers also seized 30 vehicles, all with Venezuelan license plates, which had been used to transport drugs, Castro said. Also confiscated were cocaine- processing chemicals and a cache of weapons, he said. The bust was considered one of the year\\'s most important. So far in 1990 security forces have confiscated about 45 tons of cocaine, compared to 33 tons in all of 1989. Colombia\\'s Medellin and Cali &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; cartels supply most of the &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; consumed in the United States. The coca leaf is mostly grown in Bolivia and Peru, then processed in Colombia. The Medellin cartel has been blamed for a long series of terrorist attacks in which at least 550 people have died in the past 14 months. &lt;/p&gt; 0.501531081379748  \\n   Two suspected Colombian &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers were extradited to the United States on Tuesday, the first such extraditions since President Cesar Gaviria took office last month. Jose Hilario Ortiz and Raul Hernan Buchelli, who both face &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; charges in the United States, were placed on board a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane bound for Miami, national police chief Gen. Miguel Gomez said in remarks broadcast by the RCN radio network. Ortiz faces &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; charges in Connecticut and Buchelli is wanted in Florida, said a police spokesman, requesting anonymity. No further details were immediately available. Buchelli is wanted on charges of conspiracy to smuggle and distribute heroin and money laundering, while Ortiz pleaded guilty to a &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; conspiracy charge and fled the country before sentencing, according to U.S. court records. Buchelli\\'s brother, Guido Lucio, also faces &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; charges in the United States. But he was released last week after the government rejected a U.S. request for his extradition, citing insufficient evidence. Colombia has extradited 24 suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers to the United States since August 1989, when the government launched a major anti-drug crackdown after the murder of a presidential candidate. Twelve of those extradited have either been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty; one was acquitted. An additional nine are awaiting trial. The crackdown prompted the Medellin &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; cartel to declare ``total war\\'\\' on the government a year ago. Tuesday\\'s extraditions were the first of suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers to the United States since Gaviria was inaugurated Aug. 7. He has pledged to continue the war against the &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; cartels waged by his predecessor, Virgilio Barco. Last Wednesday, Gaviria modified the country\\'s extradition policy. In a nationally televised speech, Gaviria said &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers who turn themselves in and confess their crimes would be tried in Colombia and not face extradition to the United States. Under the decree announced by Gaviria, Colombian judges would be also empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess and cooperate with local investigations. The country\\'s &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; barons have so far offered no reply to Gaviria\\'s offer. Gaviria\\'s offer appeared to be, at least in part, a response to repeated offers from the &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers to surrender to Colombian judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had been resumed last year by Barco. The &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers have feared extradition to the United States because they would have little influence over the judicial process there. Cocaine cartel members have traditionally been able to either bribe or threaten their way out of Colombian jails. Judges who refuse to be intimidated have often been slain. In his speech last week, Gaviria announced that three Colombians would soon be extradited to the United States, but he said three other U.S. extradition requests had been turned down. The third suspect set to be extradited, Joaquin Oswaldo Gallo Chamorro, was still being held in Colombia on Tuesday. Authorities did not say why he was not sent to the United States with Ortiz and Buchelli. With the latest extraditions, the U.S. Justice Department is still seeking to extradite 14 suspected &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; traffickers held in Colombia. Colombia\\'s Cali and Medellin &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; cartels supply most of the &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; consumed in the United States and Europe. Authorities blame the Medellin for killing about 550 Colombians the past year, including three presidential candidates. &lt;/p&gt; 0.440929319990765  \\n   U.S. Postal inspectors &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; 10 employees for &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; through the Dallas Main Post Office Tuesday night, following a nine-month undercover investigation. Postal Inspector Jim Travell said &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; are still looking for two more employees who were indicted for selling and distributing marijuana and &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; at the postal processing center. ``The indictments were handed down by a Dallas grand jury and charged each postal worker with selling &lt;b&gt; drugs &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; agents &lt;/b&gt; who worked in an undercover capacity at the facility,\\'\\' said Travell, of Fort Worth. Sealed indictments were handed down April 28, Travell said, but they were not unsealed until Tuesday to allow &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; time to organize the arrests. Those &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; are mail handlers or processors and distribution clerks who worked two evening shifts processing mail through the Dallas facility, Travell said. ``They worked different shifts and we have no reason to believe there was a conspiracy between them,\\'\\' Travell said. The employees, who have one to 10 years experience with the postal service, were &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; for selling between a quarter-ounce to several pounds of marijuana or between a half-gram to a quarter-ounce of &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; in any one sale to the undercover officers, Travell said. ``The largest sale we did was $1,000,\\'\\' Travell said. ``Most of them ranged from $25 to $1,000 a sale. The jist of the investigation was dealers, not users.\\'\\' Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Webster of Dallas said the employees face pentalties of 5 years to 15 years in prison and fines of $150,000 to $200,000. Travell said inspectors were alerted to a &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trafficking &lt;/b&gt; problem among the 4,000 workers at the facility by employees. ``Fellow employees are starting to be fed-up with this type of behavior,\\'\\' Travell said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.440077480020122  \\n   The prosecutor responsible for convicting reputed &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas says the powerful Medellin Cartel\\'s days are now numbered, but a defense lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned. Lehder was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons of &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; into the United States. Authorities say the 38-year-old Colombian was a key figure in the cartel, a violent &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; ring responsible for about 80 percent of U.S. &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; imports. The flamboyant Lehder, described by witnesses as a one-time New York City street hood, was characterized by U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, chief prosecutor in the case, as the most important &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; smuggler brought to trial in the United States. The verdict capped a seven-month trial on an 11-count federal indictment charging him with taking over the island of Norman\\'s Cay in the Bahamas to smuggle &lt;b&gt; cocaine &lt;/b&gt; into Florida and Georgia from 1978 to 1980. &lt;/p&gt; 0.399653013529052  \\n   Police said Monday they have &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; a man in Hong Kong in connection with the seizure of 143 pounds of heroin concealed in cans of Chinese fruit imported to Los Angeles. The man was &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; Saturday after U.S. &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; discovered the high-grade heroin hidden in 192 cans of litchis in syrup found in Los Angeles last month, police said. The &lt;b&gt; drugs &lt;/b&gt; would have sold for about $64 million in the United States, the statement said. Officers of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs also &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; two men _ a Chinese and a Vietnamese _ in Alhambra, Calif., on Saturday in connection with the &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; bust, the statement said. The man in Hong Kong was &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; after police raided sites in the colony and uncovered a &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; packaging center in an industrial building, police said. No names were released and investigations into the case were continuing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  mecham office impeachment bones senate johnson governor society loan skull threat mecham\\'s public mofford steiger post senators milstead toussaint richards &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.41779643478785  \\n   Gov. Evan Mecham broke the law and lied about it to the state Senate, a prosecutor said today in urging the Senate to convict the impeached first-term Republican and remove him from office. Prosecutor William French said in closing arguments that Mecham broke the law in borrowing $80,000 from the governor\\'s protocol fund for his auto dealership. ``He has violated the law ... He has uttered untruths to you,\\'\\' French said. Earlier, prosecutor Paul Eckstein accused Mecham of showing ``a lifetime of reckless disregard for the reputation of anyne who has stood in his path to political power.\\'\\' ``Respondent (Mecham) has demonstrated for all the world to see his plain inability to tell the truth,\\' Eckstein said. ``How much proof is required to demonstrate that respondent puffed, exaggerated, misremembered, dissembled and out-and-out lied.\\'\\' Eckstein said Mecham\\'s conduct in &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; ``was not just offensive, it was grossly offensive.\\'\\' Senators must decide whether to convict Mecham on two &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; charges issued by the Arizona House. A third charge was dismissed. A vote could come late today or Tuesday, climaxing five weeks of trial, lawmakers said. A conviction would force the first-term Republican out of office. The first &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; count accuses the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; by a state official. Mecham contended he did not intend to beak the law and that he was not fully informed of the seriousness of the alleged threat. ``Ignorance of the law is no defense,\\'\\' Eckstein told senators. But Mecham\\'s defense lawyer, Fred Craft, told senators, ``You\\'re being asked to politically assassinate the governor.\\'\\' ``He doesn\\'t resign (as Mecham has been urged to) because he\\'s not guilty of these charges,\\'\\' Craft said. ``He dares to right city hall and he\\'s doing it at great cost to himself.\\'\\' Craft said in his closing argument that the allegation was based on a 90-second conversation with Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. Craft accused prosecutors of seeking to ``twist and torture it in such a way that it accounts for an obstruction of justice.\\'\\' As closing arguments proceeded, a trumpeter played ``Taps\\'\\' outside the Senate building as a group of men carried a mock coffin labeled, ``Herein Lies the Right to an Elected Governor.\\'\\' The prosecutor accused Mecham of making a number of statements during his Senate testimony that ``are either wrong\\'\\' or were contradicted by other witnesses. Among the examples cited by Eckstein was the governor\\'s testimony, recanted a day later, that his former chief bodyguard had stolen a report from the governor\\'s office. Nonetheless, Eckstein said, Mecham and Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead gave ``remarkably similar\\'\\' accounts of their Nov. 15 conversation in which Mecham allegedly ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general\\'s investigation of the alleged threat. Mecham admitted in Senate testimony that he told Milstead, ``The attorney general is out to get me and I\\'m not going to help him in any way.\\'\\' Mecham sat at the defense table during closing arguments. When he arrived at the Capitol, he was cheered by a group of well-wishers as he walked into the Senate building behind bodyguards. He said nothing but smiled and flashed a thumbs-up signal at the crowd. Mecham, 63, who took &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; in January 1987, has maintained he is innocent of wrongdoing. He also is accused of misusing $80,000 from the governor\\'s protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. Last week the Senate dismissed a third charge that Mecham concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, the subject of the governor\\'s April 21 criminal trial. Some &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; said hearing testimony on that allegation could have prejudiced his criminal trial. However, Democrats acknowledged that the real reason they favored dismissing the charge was to ensure a Senate trial verdict well before the scheduled May 17 gubernatorial recall election. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required for conviction. Lawmakers also could bar Mecham from holding any future &lt;b&gt; public &lt;/b&gt; office. If convicted, Mecham would become the seventh U.S. &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; removed from &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; by impeachment. The prosecution contends the governor\\'s protocol fund _ created with inaugural ball proceeds _ was a &lt;b&gt; public &lt;/b&gt; fund and that Mecham Pontiac needed the $80,000 &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; to meet its July 1987 payroll. However, the defense said the fund was private money and that the &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; was intended merely to provide a higher interest rate for the fund. Mecham Pontiac was in good financial shape and could have borrowed the money elsewhere, according to testimony by the governor\\'s son, Dennis, who is general manager of the dealership. But the day after he testified last week, Dennis Mecham announced the dealership was being sold. Sales had suffered due to the ``avalanche of negative publicity\\'\\' about the governor, he said. The allegation regarding the death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; has boiled down to Mecham\\'s word against that of Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead. He testified that Mecham ordered him not to cooperate with the attorney general\\'s investigation of the alleged &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; by state official Lee Watkins against former top Mecham aide Donna Carlson. At the time of the alleged &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; in November, Ms. Carlson was about to testify before the state grand jury regarding the $350,000 campaign loan. Senators, meanwhile, said they knew how important the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; vote will be. If the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; is allowed to return to his job, ``I think there\\'ll be terrible chaos in state government,\\'\\' said Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat. Lawmakers\\' own careers also may hang in the balance, some &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.360770902047693  \\n   Gov. Evan Mecham should be removed from &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; for obstructing an investigation of an alleged death threat, &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; were told today during opening arguments of the first-term Republican\\'s &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial. But a defense attonrey for Mecham told &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; in an impassioned statement that Mecham was the victim of a ``mutiny\\'\\' by the state attorney general and director of the state Department of Public Safety. Prosecutor William French said the man accused of making the alleged threat, former state official Lee Watkins, had claimed that jobs in the Mecham administration ``relate to the amount of money that you were able to bring into the campaign.\\'\\' French said the evidence was ``overwhelming\\'\\' that Mecham violated criminal laws and his oath of &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and committed malfeasance in office, ``any one of which call for impeachment.\\'\\' However, defense attorney Fred Craft told &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; in his opening statement that Mecham broke no laws and was acting within his authority. ``What has this man done?\\'\\' Craft said. ``There\\'s something wrong in this state when you can depose the constitutionally elected officer of the state and throw the book at him ... based upon evidence that\\'s being presented by people who have a stake in the outcome to have him ousted.\\'\\' Craft said the accusations resulted from a ``mutiny\\'\\' by Attorney General Bob Corbin and DPS Director Ralph Milstead. The DPS includes the Highway Patrol and investigative personnel. Craft also said he would present testimony that would cast dubt on Milstead\\'s integrity. Mecham, who also faces a March 22 criminal trial and a May 17 recall election, did not appear at the Senate on the second day of his &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial. The &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; counts against Mecham include an allegation that he ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general\\'s probe of an alleged death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; by Watkins, then the state prison construction chief. ``There was an obstruction with regard to an ongoing investigation that was being conducted by the attorney general\\'s office,\\'\\' French said. Watkins has denied making a &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; against Donna Carlson, a former top Mecham aide who testified before the state grand jury on Mecham\\'s failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan. DPS Officer Frank Martinez, a former member of Mecham\\'s security detail who was called as the trial\\'s first witness, testified this morning that Mecham administration official Peggy Griffith told him about a conversation she had with Watkins. Ms. Griffith said Watkins had told her that if Ms. Carlson ``did not keep her mouth shut, she could wind up taking a long boat ride ... and I know the right people who can help me,\\'\\' Martinez testified. Martinez said that he met with Milstead, other DPS officers, Corbin and several assistant attorneys general several days later and that Milstead told of a conversation he had with Mecham. Martinez said Milstead told the group that Mecham ``stated he didn\\'t want him helping the attorney general.\\'\\' ``The overall mood was just amazement,\\'\\' Martinez testified. Craft said Milstead and other officials did not fully advise Mecham about the alleged threat, adding that Milstead ``was a feckless employee of this state and he did not serve that &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; well.\\'\\' French said Watkins complained about the job he was given by Mecham and told Corrections Director Sam Lewis, ``If they don\\'t treat me right I can bring Mecham\\'s administration down.\\'\\' French warned the Senate to ``keep your eye on the ball\\'\\' and not be distracted by any attacks on witnesses in the case. ``Know that this is being done because there is no defense,\\'\\' French said. The opening arguments today dealt only with the alleged threat. Arguments will precede discussion of the other allegations against Mecham as they are reached during the trial. On the trial\\'s opening day Monday, the Senate strongly rejected efforts to dismiss &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; charges against Mecham. Also, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule today on a defense claim that the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial, the first of a U.S. &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; in 59 years, should be delayed until after Mecham\\'s March 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. The high court last week refused to grant a temporary delay, and Mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court if necessary. Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, said ``it was the first-day jitters for everyone\\'\\' in the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial\\'s opening day Monday. ``It crosses everybody\\'s mind _ the importance to do justice to the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; and the state,\\'\\' said Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, also a Republican. ``It\\'s a large burden and we take it seriously.\\'\\' Senators refused to dismiss the 23 articles of &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; against Mecham, whose attorney, Jerris Leonard, entered an innocent plea on his behalf. On 11 separate motions, the largest number of the 29 &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; voting for dismissal was seven. Several &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; said the vote should not be considered an indication that Mecham is likely to be convicted, saying they want to hear the evidence first. However, Sen. Jeff Hill, a Republican who has strongly backed Mecham, said the governor\\'s conviction was virtually a foregone conclusion. ``I think that it\\'s not likely that he\\'s going to prevail,\\'\\' he said. If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be removed from &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and could be permanently barred from holding elective &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; in Arizona. Mecham, 63, won election in a three-way race after five tries. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and insisted he will survive both trials and a May 17 recall election and return to the &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; he gave up to acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, when he was impeached by the House on Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt; 0.342604915673256  \\n   His governorship gone, his ailing auto dealership sold, Evan Mecham faces a future in which one of the few certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial. But for Arizona, the future looks brighter without the shadow of Mecham\\'s embarrassing &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial hanging over the state, said Rose Mofford, who became &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; with Mecham\\'s removal. ``Today we have reached the end of some difficult times in Arizona,\\'\\' Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, said Monday. ``I know the decision made by the Senate today was not reached lightly. It is time to put all that behind us and move forward.\\'\\' ``Today none of us are Republicans, none of us are Democrats,\\'\\' she said. ``We are all Arizonans. Let us go forward together as Arizonans.\\'\\' The impeached first-term Republican was stripped of his &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; Monday when the Senate convicted him of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; and misusing the governor\\'s protocol fund. The end of the trial did not heal the divisions that arose during Mecham\\'s turbulent 15 months in office. Predictably, the verdict was praised by Mecham opponents and condemned by supporters. Some legislators received police protection Monday night after getting threatening phone calls that were prompted by the vote, said Department of Public Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt. ``They\\'ve been all types of intimidating-type threatening statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate,\\'\\' Schmidt said. Mecham\\'s future troubles could include a maximum 22-year prison sentence if he is convicted on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. He faces trial April 21 in Maricopa County Superior Court on six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents. His brother Willard, who was his 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts. The Senate threw out an &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; count based on the $350,000 &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; issue. Although the Senate did not bar Mecham from holding &lt;b&gt; public &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; again, his lawyer, Jerris Leonard, indicated after the &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; vote that Mecham may decide to bow out of politics. ``I think there is doubt,\\'\\' he said of whether Mecham would try to appeal his case to voters in a recall election May 17. It was not clear whether the ousted &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; could remain on the recall ballot given him &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; conviction. The matter probably will be decided by the courts, said Attorney General Bob Corbin. Leonard said, ``I think the decision of where we go from now is dependent on whether or not the &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; himself wants to stay in politics and that\\'s something that he\\'s got to decide overnight.\\'\\' After Monday\\'s conviction, Mecham left the Senate chamber smiling. Asked what he planned next, he said, ``We\\'ll decide tomorrow or the next day ... We\\'re keeping all our options open.\\'\\' After he was impeached by the House of Representatives on Feb. 5, the 63-year-old Mecham hinted he might give up politics. ``If I can be of service, fine,\\'\\' he said. ``If not, I\\'d enjoy private life. The best person doesn\\'t always win. Politics is not my favorite pastime.\\'\\' Mecham ran for &lt;b&gt; governor &lt;/b&gt; five times before being elected in 1986. Although Mecham\\'s son, Dennis, testified last week that their Mecham Pontiac dealership in suburban Glendale was thriving, he announced a day later that they\\'d been forced to sell it for $4 million because of dwindling sales. Dennis Mecham said bad publicity surrounding his father\\'s political battles had driven customers away. The dealership was sold last week. &lt;/p&gt; 0.339381693729968  \\n   Skull and Bones, the oldest and most secret senior &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; at Yale University, boasts many distinguished alumni but none more prominent today than a ``spook\\'\\' from the class of 1948 _ George Herbert Walker Bush. Little is known about the strange rituals and practices of the 156-year-old society, and that\\'s the way its members want it. The rites are rumored to include placing initiates in a coffin and requiring them to plunge naked into a pile of mud. Some of the rumors come from rival societies, and may be suspect. No one but members really know what goes on inside the windowless, mausoleum-style structure of brown sandstone to which Bonesmen retreat. But as the Republican presidential nominee\\'s own experience has shown, membership in the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; forms powerful bonds of friendship that endure long after graduation. The vice president was one of 15 Yale juniors tapped for Skull and Bones in 1947. To this day, the Bonesmen who once heard him recount some of the innermost secrets of his life remain his good friends. Perhaps because of the pledge of secrecy that Bonesmen take, Bush did not mention his Skull and Bones membership in his autobiography, ``Looking Forward.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; has long been suspected of ritualistic thefts. A group of history buffs in El Paso, Texas, claimed that the &lt;b&gt; skull &lt;/b&gt; referred to in the society\\'s name belongs to Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, whose grave was robbed in 1926. Endicott Davison, a lawyer who says he speaks for Skull and Bones, said the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; does not have the skull. The former chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe in Arizona charged recently that Bush\\'s father, Prescott Bush, stole the &lt;b&gt; skull &lt;/b&gt; of Apache chief Geronimo years ago, and that it is still on display at Skull and Bones\\' inner sanctum. That claim was denied by the vice president\\'s brother, Jonathan Bush. One thing is not disputed: Bush the Bonesman is in powerful company. Brothers of the order have included Henry Stimson, Averell Harriman, Henry Luce, Potter Stewart, McGeorge Bundy, Archibald MacLeish, William F. Buckley Jr. and William Sloan Coffin Jr. Prescott Bush, a Republican senator from Connecticut, was a member. So was Bush\\'s oldest son, George W. Bush, and about a half-dozen other family members. Skull and Bones is arguably the most famous and influential secret &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; in the United States, having served as a model for others that followed at Yale and other institutions. It was founded by William Russell, a member of the Yale Class of 1833, apparently in reaction to the stripping of secrecy from Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic society, during the rise of a national anti-secrecy movement. Skull and Bones is a private organization incorporated as the Russell Trust Association. It pays taxes to the city of New Haven and owns Deer Island, a resort on the St. Lawrence River. Giving Skull and Bones the benefit of the doubt, Brooks Mather Kelly, in a 1974 history of Yale, wrote of the society: ``Its purpose and programs were not revealed when it was founded and have never since been known. But that like most Yale societies it pretends to some intellectual and educational purpose can probably be assumed.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; ``comes from a tradition of elitism of which Yale was at the center,\\'\\' said Dan A. Oren, author of ``Joining The Club,\\'\\' a book published in 1985 about the relationship between the university and Jews. Skull and Bones became the first of the secret societies to admit a Jew in 1937. During the 1960s, the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; tapped a number of outspoken radicals. Even today, however, it remains steadfastly all-male. Of Yale\\'s seven secret undergraduate societies, only one other _ Wolf\\'s Head _ refuses to admit women. Having women as members would interfere with one of the ways Bonesmen become true brothers. By all accounts, Skull and Bones initiates must lay bare their souls, telling their sexual histories and life stories in graphic detail. ``The danger of secret societies and entering into the club world is it allows members to lose sight of the common folk who aren\\'t part of the elite,\\'\\' Oren said. But he said that Bush\\'s experiences in World War II combat worked the other way. ``For so many veterans, their fight was against the racists and the bigoted values of Nazi Germany, so when they came back, they were embued with a strong sense of egalitarianism,\\'\\' Oren said. Bush, 21 and already married, entered Yale in 1945 after his discharge from the Navy, which awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for his wartime exploits. While on one combat mission, Bush\\'s plane was shot down and he was rescued by a submarine. Two fellow crewmen perished. Bush recounted his brush with death for Bonesmen in 1947 with great emotion, says former Rep. Thomas W.L. Ashley, D-Ohio, another member of the Bones class of 1948. ``What comes to mind was, he was an awful young guy who had had an idyllic kind of childhood who suddenly found himself in an airplane that was on fire facing a lot of death around him and almost certain death himself,\\'\\' Ashley said. Ashley and other Bonesmen in his Yale class are still close friends of Bush. ``Obviously, we became fond of each other,\\'\\' Ashley said. ``This was something kind of special to us.\\'\\' He added: ``George Bush is exactly just as loyal to other friends as those who happened to be in the &lt;b&gt; society &lt;/b&gt; with him. His friendship across the social range is known to everyone.\\'\\' Members of the Bones class of 1948 came to Washington in 1981 for a reunion that included dinner at the vice president\\'s mansion and a tour of the White House Oval Office. ``His having been a member of Skull and Bones and his continued involvement as an alumnus means he would probably be likely to draw upon past connections for the White House,\\'\\' Oren said. ``But his choice of people _ James Baker III to be campaign manager, Dan Quayle as vice president _ shows he\\'s willing to go beyond Yale,\\'\\' Oren said. ``He has always maintained close connections to Skull and Bones, but his world certainly goes beyond New Haven.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.285543267407195  \\n   A jury on Thursday convicted former U.S. Rep. Sam Steiger of theft by extortion for threatening a parole board member to get his vote on a personnel matter while serving in the Evan Mecham administration. ``Any time you go to court you can expect a guilty verdict, but it\\'s difficult to believe,\\'\\' Steiger said in the courtroom moments after the jury returned its verdict. Steiger, who was a top aide to the now-ousted Republican governor, was accused of threatening Ron Johnson, a member of the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. Steiger allegedly threatened to withhold permission for Johnson to work as a part-time Tempe justice of the peace and to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain as executive director Patricia Costello, a Mecham appointee. Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court scheduled a May 6 sentencing for the 59-year-old Steiger, who faces up to five years in prison. Asked whether the verdict would be appealed, defense attorney Thomas Karas said, ``We\\'ll take it one step at a time.\\'\\' Steiger said, ``That\\'s up to counsel.\\'\\' Jury foreman Greg Jones, a fire captain in suburban Mesa, said the deciding factor behind the verdict was ``the tapes of the phone call between Steiger and Johnson.\\'\\' Johnson called Steiger at home from the &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; of the state attorney general, who taped the call. During testimony Monday, Steiger denied that he threatened Johnson or told him how he should vote. But the state alleged that Steiger followed up on the alleged &lt;b&gt; threat &lt;/b&gt; in a letter and a telephone conversation after Johnson voted with the board majority to seek Ms. Costello\\'s resignation. The board voted 4-3 that Ms. Costello should step down because of low staff morale. Steiger, a former five-term congressman, testified that he did suggest that Johnson should back Ms. Costello but denied that he tried to ``steal\\'\\' Johnson\\'s vote by threatening his job. Karas had asked Reinstein to declare a mistrial, contending the conviction of Mecham at his state Senate &lt;b&gt; impeachment &lt;/b&gt; trial Monday might prejudice jurors against Steiger. However, Reinstein ruled that great care had been taken to select unbiased jurors. Steiger gave up his 3rd Congressional District seat in 1976 to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  miles people damage area city water state town south north earthquake feet quake ground residents scale river buildings hit southern &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.81596056916631  \\n   A small &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; rattled central Utah early today, but there were no reports of &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; or injury. The &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; struck at 6:44 a.m. and registered 4.6 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey\\'s National Earthquake Information Service at Golden, Colo. It was an aftershock of an earlier temblor. Initial reports of the &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; came from Price, East Carbon and Helper. The quake\\'s epicenter was 34 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; of Price. The Carbon County sheriff\\'s office said it received numerous calls, and the Emery County sheriff\\'s office also received a few calls from &lt;b&gt; residents &lt;/b&gt; asking about the earthquake. The central Utah &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; hit &lt;/b&gt; by three quakes on Sunday, the largest of which was 5.6 on the Richter scale. The temblors caused minor &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; and were followed by about a dozen aftershocks on Monday. Seismologists had said aftershocks could continue through mid-week. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; is a measure of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 4.5 reflects an &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; 10 times stronger than one of 3.5. An &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; of 3.5 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; can cause slight &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; in a populated &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; and a 4 can cause moderate &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; in the local area. &lt;/p&gt; 0.772637586086353  \\n   A moderate &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; shook southeastern Alaska early today, but there were no immediate reports of &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; or injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported. The 7:01 a.m. temblor measured 5.2 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; and was centered on the mainland about 80 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southeast of Yakutat, or 130 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northwest of Juneau, said George Carte, a warning center spokesman. In Washington, Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, said &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; monitors in Golden, Colo., recorded the tremor at a preliminary magnitude of 4.8 on the Richter scale. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; is a measure of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; 10 time stronger than one of 6.5. An &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage. The 1964 Good Friday &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; in Alaska measured 8.5 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; and was centered in Prince William Sound. It generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed at least 114 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; as far &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; as Oregon and Hawaii. &lt;/p&gt; 0.752233028146661  \\n   A strong &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; shook northern Taiwan on Sunday. Police said it unleashed rockslides that injured 13 people. They said the injured &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; hit &lt;/b&gt; by falling rocks at three waterfall tourist sites in suburban Taipei. The quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, set off rock avalanches in an &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; covering 1,200 square yards, authorities said. The injured, who were all Taiwanese, were taken to a hospital, police said. One was reported to be in serious condition, and the others suffered only minor injuries. The Central Weather Bureau placed the epicenter of the early-afternoon &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; in Sanchi, a coastal village about 10 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Taipei. The &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; was felt in the capital, where &lt;b&gt; residents &lt;/b&gt; reported their houses shook violently, the bureau said. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; measures &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a ten-fold increase in intensity. An &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 5 can cause serious &lt;b&gt; damage &lt;/b&gt; in a populated area, and one of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. &lt;/p&gt; 0.730664497070641  \\n   A series of aftershocks jolted northern Japan on Saturday following several earthquakes, and police reported landslides, cracked roads and damaged buildings. There were no reports of injuries from the series of quakes Friday evening near Takada, 140 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Tokyo. A total of 10 aftershocks had been recorded following the first and strongest &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; Friday evening, which registered 5.5 on the Richter scale, the Central Meteorological Agency said. No Richter readings were available for the aftershocks. All the quakes on Friday were centered at a depth of about three &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; in western Niigata Prefecture along the coast of the Sea of Japan, it said. Police said the earthquakes caused a 75-foot section of a road to sink, set off 30 landslides, and created cracks in roads and the &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; at 60 locations. The hardest-hit &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; was Takayanagimachi, a &lt;b&gt; town &lt;/b&gt; of 4,000 people, where a dozen homes suffered minor damage, including broken furniture and window panes, police said. The Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; is a measure of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; motion as recorded on seismographs. &lt;/p&gt; 0.636642447179004  \\n   A minor &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; shook pictures off walls in two central Oklahoma communities early today but experts said there was no connection with a potential major &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; on the New Madrid Fault. The Oklahoma Geological Survey said the &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; registered 3.6 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; movement. A &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage. A &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. The National Weather Service said it had received reports of a tremor about 5:45 a.m. that was felt in Rush Springs, about 40 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southwest of Oklahoma City, and Lindsay, about 28 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; of Oklahoma City. The geological survey said the &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; was centered 5 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Lindsay. ``Police departments in those areas indicate that pictures fell from walls, objects were knocked off tables and out of cabinets and many &lt;b&gt; residents &lt;/b&gt; were awakened,\\'\\' the weather service said in a statement. Geological survey director Charles Mankin said earthquakes are common in Oklahoma, with a couple a week detected by sensitive seismographs. ``We rarely record them as high as 3.6,\\'\\' he said. ``But a small &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; in that &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; is not unusual.\\'\\' Larry Thompson of KBLP radio in Lindsay said the station was flooded with calls after the tremor was felt. At the police department, dispatcher Lois Knapp said the shaking lasted about two seconds. ``This police department is cement and brick and rock, and it moved,\\'\\' she said. There has been increased concern about a Midwestern &lt;b&gt; earthquake &lt;/b&gt; since a New Mexico climatologist projected that there could be a major one in early December along the New Madrid Fault, which runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark. The projection, based on the fact that tidal forces will be particularly strong early next month, is disputed by most scientists. Mankin said there was no link between today\\'s &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; and the New Madrid Fault. ``Most of the earthquakes in Oklahoma we have not been able to relate to faults,`` Mankin said. ``They\\'re very shallow earthquakes and we know they\\'re from some &lt;b&gt; ground &lt;/b&gt; adjustment, obviously, but we can\\'t relate them to some fault.\\'\\' In 1811-1812, a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the Richter &lt;b&gt; scale &lt;/b&gt; struck the New Madrid Fault, ringing church bells in Washington, D.C., more than 850 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; away. Jim Lawson, chief geophysicist at the geological survey, said earlier this week that even if a major &lt;b&gt; quake &lt;/b&gt; occurred along the New Madrid Fault, its effect in Oklahoma would be negligible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  tax income taxes irs benefits estate returns federal paid payments year property pay amount taxpayers interest fees revenue social insurance &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.589980199864205  \\n   The disposition of an individual\\'s &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; need not be a guessing game. Yet many people are unaware that by establishing a sound &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; plan they easily may shelter many holdings from probate. Still more don\\'t know the principles behind assessing their estate. But by better understanding how the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; government governs &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; taxes, people may avoid or reduce the future &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liabilities. This &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; savings can preserve assets in the &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; that otherwise might be used to &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; death taxes. These assets then may be passed on to a spouse, children, or charity. There are several steps to take in evaluating your estate. First, determine the nature and the value of your estate\\'s assets. Assts may include: your residence, other &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; such as a vacation home, household furnishings, savings bonds, stocks, checking and savings accounts, pension benefits, life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies, automobiles. For &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; purposes, there are several exceptions to determining the value of an asset: - For jointly owned assets held by spouses, only half the value of the asset is included in your &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; if you are the first spouse to die. - For life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies, the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; included in your &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; is the face &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of the policy rather than its replacement cost or present cash value (if whole life) at the date of your death. - If you die before retirement, you receive none of your pension. However, half the value of the pension is payable to your spouse and half the vested plan &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; - what would have been available to you had you lived to retirement - are included in your gross estate. - Finally, Series EE bonds are included at their present value when they mature. - All other assets generally are included at fair market value. Second, determine your deductions when calculating &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; tax. Include funeral expenses, costs of the last illness of the decendent, if applicable; unpaid debts and mortgages; and administrative expenses for the estate. You\\'ll incur fewer administrative expenses for assets transferred outside of the probate. To avoid probate, you may set up a living trust, although it will create some trust administration costs. In addition, &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant outside the probate process. Other &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; of a contractual nature - such as life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies or qualified pension plans - also will transfer to the beneficiary outside of probate. Step three, determine which &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; qualifies for the marital deduction or charitable deduction. Three factors make a difference: - If your will transfers &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; to your spouse, this &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; is held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; passes to the surviving spouse and qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; or qualified pension plan names your spouse as policy beneficiary or plan benificiary, this, too, qualifies. The same kinds of arrangements will qualify &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; for the charitable &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; deduction if &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; is left to the charity as a result of a will, a specific &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; designation such as a joint tenancy, or a contractual benificiary designation. Any &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; qualifying for the marital deduction or the charitable deduction is not subject to &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability. Remaining &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; is referred to as the taxable estate. The fourth, and final, step is to determine estimated &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability on the taxable estate. The unified &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; and gift transfer &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; rates apply to the taxable &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; when calculating the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; tax. Every individual, regardless of the size of his or her estate, is entitled to a unified credit of $192,800 that absorbs, dollar for dollar, the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of that individual\\'s &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability up to that amount. This assumes that you did not make any lifetime gifts to an individual in any one &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; while alive that exceeded the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of the gift &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; annual exclusion &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of $10,000. Here, a rule of thumb applies. For your &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability to be greater than $192,800, your taxable &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; must be greater than $600,000. As long as a husband and wife each hold $600,000 in separately owned assets, the couple can own a total of $1.2 million in assets and the entire &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; for both estates avoids &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liability. The process of rearranging &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; ownership for &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; assets, so that each spouse\\'s &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; takes maximum advantage is known as ``estate equalization.\\'\\' Many people assume they won\\'t have assets exceeding $600,000, but in these days of appreciated home values and sizable pension plans or life &lt;b&gt; insurance &lt;/b&gt; policies, estates are often of surprising size. --- EDITOR\\'S NOTE - Paul Lochray is an academic associate in the &lt;b&gt; estate &lt;/b&gt; planning division of the College for Financial Planning in Denver. &lt;/p&gt; 0.53898425780541  \\n   The Internal Revenue Service said it is closing a loophole that allowed procrastinating &lt;b&gt; taxpayers &lt;/b&gt; to slip out of the country briefly on April 15th and gain an automatic two-month extension on filing their &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; taxes. The new ruling, announced Monday, is effective for &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; forms due next month, and requires &lt;b&gt; taxpayers &lt;/b&gt; to be out of the country for at least two weeks, including April 15th, to qualify for the automatic extension. In the past, someone who left the country for just hours or minutes on the 15th was eligible. &lt;/p&gt; 0.483409614624344  \\n   Farmers who received some government information late have been given additional time to file their 1987 &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; income-tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service said Monday it was granting special relief to farmers who did not receive Agriculture Department documents by the Feb. 15 scheduled date. Those documents are Form 1099-G, which reflects certain government payments, and Form 1099-A, on which acquisitions or abandonments of secured &lt;b&gt; property &lt;/b&gt; are reported. Farmers generally are not subject to penalties for underpayments if they file their &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; by March 1. The IRS concluded that farmers who failed to receive required information from the Agriculture Department by Feb. 15 might be unable to meet the March 1 deadline. The IRS said farmers affected by the delay should attach to their &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; return a Form 2210F on which they have written their name and Social Security number and, on the bottom right, the words ``farm waiver.\\'\\' With the extension, farmers will have to file &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; any &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; owed by April 15, the deadline for most taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.453584332736209  \\n   The government is losing billions of dollars in &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; revenues each &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; because the Internal Revenue Service does not use an enforcement program on business &lt;b&gt; taxpayers &lt;/b&gt; that it has been using effectively on individuals, a House panel said Monday. A report from the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between $3.2 billion and $8 billion a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt; taxes &lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividends earned by businesses is never collected because the &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; is not reported to the IRS. While the &lt;b&gt; revenue &lt;/b&gt; loss estimates ``are not statistically precise,\\'\\' the report said they provide ample justification for the IRS to include businesses in the document-matching program it now uses to verify &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividend earnings on individual &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; returns. Under the existing document-matching program, the IRS compares ``information returns\\'\\' detailing &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividend &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to individuals with the individuals\\' actual &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; returns. The program in fiscal 1985 produced $2.35 billion in additional &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; revenue &lt;/b&gt; from individuals. Although banks and corporations are not required to file such information &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to corporations, the House report said the IRS received _ but never used _ 26 million such &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; in 1985, showing &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to 5 million businesses totaling $987 billion. ``By casting these information &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; aside, IRS is not only missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported business &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; liabilities but has created a double standard of enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than individuals,\\'\\' said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee. IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday the agency has not seen the House report and will have no comment until agecny officials can review it. But at a hearing before Barnard\\'s subcommittee last year, IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said the costs of implementing a document-matching program for corporations would not be justified by the additional &lt;b&gt; revenue &lt;/b&gt; that would be generated. Gibbs said the administrative costs of a document-matching program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different names. Although the problems cited by Gibbs all ``pertain to the way &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; is reported\\'\\' to the IRS, the House report said the IRS ``never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial document-matching program encompassing those corporations to which the difficulties do not pertain.\\'\\' Gibbs told the subcommittee last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; the IRS would begin using document-matching to verify &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; reported on &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; from single-owner businesses and would initiate a multi-year study to determine the extent of business underreporting of &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; and dividend income. He also promised to begin a test program using information &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file any &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; tax &lt;/b&gt; return. The House report said the test program in one district office was so effective the IRS now has expanded it to nine more districts and could have a document-matching program ready by next spring to identify non-filers among corporations and partnerships nationwide. But despite such efforts, Barnard said the IRS ``has not been sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated computer matching capabilities to businesses.\\'\\' ``Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and every one of their &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; will be scrutinized by IRS\\' computers for unreported &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; deserve to know why corporate and partnership &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; are being excused from this automatic examination process,\\'\\' Barnard said. The report said Congress should help the IRS set up a document-matching program for corporate &lt;b&gt; returns &lt;/b&gt; by enacting legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions report to the IRS all dividend and &lt;b&gt; interest &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; to corporations. Barnard introduced such legislation earlier this year, but it was never reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee. &lt;/p&gt; 0.424224737025707  \\n   Social Security officials say a quadriplegic who won a seat in the Legislature has been warned he could lose his medical &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; if he takes his newly won seat and begins drawing expense reimbursements. Bill Boharski, a Kalispell Republican, defeated Democrat Gordon Hall in November, to win his first term in the Montana House. But after drawing expense reimbursements for attending legislative caucuses in November, Boharski said he was notified the reimbursements were ``unearned income\\'\\' that would make him ineligible for continued medical &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; under Medicare and Medicaid. And Boharski, who is paralyzed from injuries he suffered in an automobile accident five years ago, says he can\\'t afford to lose the money. He estimates his medical expenses at $15,000 a year. ``That put me in a position where I had to seriously consider whether or not I had to resign my position,\\'\\' the 27-year-old legislator-elect said. ``That &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of medical bills isn\\'t something you can just pay.\\'\\' Boharski said the situation is not desperate because state and &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; officials are trying to help. Legislative leaders say they\\'re considering a change in state compensation law to redefine the reimbursements, and Boharski said Social Security has advised him the case is under review. Boharski also said he will ask Congress for help if need be. Montana legislators earn $52.13 for each working day in the session plus $50 a day during the session as reimbursement for living expenses in Helena. The 1989 session begins Monday. It\\'s the expense reimbursement that concerns Social Security Administration officials. Mark Fredenberg, operations supervisor for the agency\\'s Kalispell office, said that under &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; law, the expense allowances are considered unearned income. Social Security disability &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; are reduced by the &lt;b&gt; amount &lt;/b&gt; of unearned &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; over $20 that a person receives, he said. And a person who loses eligibility for those &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; because of unearned &lt;b&gt; income &lt;/b&gt; also loses eligibility for medical coverage, he said. Most people receiving disability &lt;b&gt; payments &lt;/b&gt; don\\'t work or don\\'t travel to work, Fredenberg noted, saying a situation such as Boharski\\'s arises ``very, very seldom.\\'\\' Boharski said he checked into the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulations before he filed for office last spring. He said he was told then he would qualify for continued medical &lt;b&gt; benefits &lt;/b&gt; if elected, under a program that allows people to continue receiving medical coverage even if they are working. Boharski said Social Security officials have since told him he should be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. But, he said, he hasn\\'t yet received written verification. Fredenberg said he could not comment directly on Boharski\\'s case because of &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; privacy laws. Boharski said if legislation at the state level doesn\\'t resolve the problem, he will try to have changes made at the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; level so he can retain his legislative seat. ``I\\'m counting on staying,\\'\\' he said. ``Anyone who knows me knows I don\\'t quit that easy.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  killed army troops guerrillas forces attacks fighting security northern rebels soldiers wounded beirut military ireland bomb terrorist bombing ira responsibility &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.635865970826442  \\n   Rival Christian &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; today used a cease-fire to stockpile weapons and redeploy &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; for their next battle, while civilians fled their ruined neighborhoods for refuge in safer Moslem areas. Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia, refused to give any concessions to Gen. Michel Aoun and said his fighters were ready for war. A source close to Geagea\\'s command said his militia had adopted a new &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; plan to block any attempt by Aoun to storm its strongholds if the current cease-fire collapses. ``If clashes break out anew, it will be a tough, crushing battle throughout the Christian enclave,\\'\\' the source said. Snipers &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; one person and &lt;b&gt; wounded &lt;/b&gt; five in various parts of the Christian enclave today, police said. By police count, the fight for the 310-square-mile enclave has &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; at least 673 people and &lt;b&gt; wounded &lt;/b&gt; 1,877, in addition to inflicting more than $750 million in damage. The dead include 97 &lt;b&gt; soldiers &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since the confrontation broke out Jan. 30. The &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; began when Geagea refused Aoun\\'s demand that he disband the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia in Lebanon. Geagea\\'s 6,000-strong militia has deployed about one-third of its fighters in east Beirut, the &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; source said. They are to defend its urban strongholds and deny Aoun access to the port through the streets of the Ashrafiyeh district. Aoun lost the port in the early days of the fighting. Military analysts believe Aoun must regain control of the port to ensure safe supply lines by sea before accepting any peace settlement. The Lebanese Forces moved new heavy fire power into place in the Kesrouan mountains to harass Aoun\\'s back if he tries to move into the port area, the source said. The upgraded fire power includes about 120 truck-mounted multi-barreled rocket launchers brought out of weapons depots. The launchers, obtained from Iraq more than a year ago, can fire 40 122mm shells a minute. Geagea\\'s men are outnumbered by Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; at least 3-to-1 and hoped to counter his superiority with their upgraded weapons, the source said. Lebanese &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; militiamen, with nearly 15 years\\' experience in street battles, ``are waiting for Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; in the narrow alleys of Ashrafiyeh, which has become a huge garrison,\\'\\' the source said. The militia force defending the port, Ashrafiyeh and the &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; headquarters of Karantina have been beefed up from 1,200 to 2,000 men, the source said. The surrender of Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; Saturday at Adma, an isolated pocket in Kesrouan, freed the militiamen for the new deployment. The source said the bulk of the militia\\'s &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; force, backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers, was deployed along the southern and eastern edges of Kesrouan province, separated from Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; by a no-man\\'s-land of just a few hundred yards. A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations, confirmed that both factions were bolstering their forces. Aoun\\'s &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; stockpiled ammunition, especially tank cannon and howitzer rounds, in depots in the Metin mountains northeast of the capital. Meanwhile, civilians continued to desert the Christian enclave, seeking refuge in the predominately Moslem areas outside the enclave. The Christian communities, dispersed throughout Lebanon before the civil war, have gradually consolidated in the enclave since 1975. &lt;/p&gt; 0.59707854563647  \\n   Christian and Moslem militiamen today exchanged mortar fire across Beirut\\'s dividing Green Line. No casualties were reported. The two-hour battle in downtown Beirut came amid reports of growing tension between a Christian militia and the Lebanese army. There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth between civil war antagonists in Beirut in two weeks. The clashes have strained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975. The &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians\\' main militia, in east Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital. Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all over the Christian sector of Beirut and along the main coastal highway running north from the city, witnesses reported. Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons searched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But the Christian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension between the militia and the Lebanese army, which is controlled by Christian officers. The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexing show to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army. The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. Michel Aoun, has been quoted by several Beirut newspapers recently as saying the &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; could finish off the militia any time it wanted. Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by the Maronite Catholic commander to become the next president of Lebanon after President Amin Gemayel\\'s six-year term expires in September. Aoun, who has not denied the statements, has not offically proclaimed his candidacy. &lt;/p&gt; 0.575284714154695  \\n   Israeli-backed Christian militiamen shelled a U.N.-policed vilage in south Lebanon today, wounding an Irish peacekeeper, three Lebanese women and an 8-year-old boy. Timur Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, said the Irishman was injured in the head when a 60mm mortar round crashed into one of the Irish battalion posts in Qabrikha, 18 miles east of Tyre. He declined to give the Irishman\\'s name. Lebanese police later said four villagers, including three women and a boy, also were &lt;b&gt; wounded &lt;/b&gt; in the bombardment. Police said the South Lebanon Army militia opened up on the Shiite Moslem village after a roadside &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; exploded in the village of Qantara, in Israel\\'s self-designated securitu zone in south Lebanon. It as not clear whether anyone was hurt in the explosion. The 2,000-man militia patrols the 6-to-10-mile deep &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; zone jointly with Israeli troops. The buffer was established after Israel withdrew the bulk of its occupation force from south Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year invasion. &lt;/p&gt; 0.574702319084469  \\n   Rebels said Friday they had overrun three more government garrisons in southern Sudan and beaten back a &lt;b&gt; military &lt;/b&gt; convoy trying to stage a rescue mission. In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army said it captured Kologi in southern Kordofan province on Wednesday ``after seven days of heavy &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; preceded by a one-month siege.\\'\\' The broadcast said rebel &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; also ambushed a 33-vehicle convoy, including four tanks, that was trying to reach Kologi and ``forced it to retreat with heavy losses.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; rebels &lt;/b&gt; also claimed the capture of two smaller garrison towns, Bazia on Jan. 24 and Amati on Wednesday. The report could not be independently confirmed, but if true would bring to more than 15 the number of garrisons captured by the &lt;b&gt; rebels &lt;/b&gt; the past three months. &lt;/p&gt; 0.567835175387803  \\n   A ``human bomb\\'\\' attack, similar to last month\\'s IRA &lt;b&gt; bombing &lt;/b&gt; which &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; seven people, failed when the enormous &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; fizzled, police said Friday. No one immediately claimed &lt;b&gt; responsibility &lt;/b&gt; for Thursday night\\'s failed attack but a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabular said the Irish Republican Army was suspected. The RUC spokesman said armed, masked men kidnapped a man from his home near Newtown Butler and ordered him to drive a truck containing a 3,500-pound &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; to an &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; checkpoint at Annaghmartin. The gang tied up the man\\'s elderly parents and locked them in a bathroom while the man was driven near the checkpoint, 56 miles southwest of Belfast. The man was told to deliver the bomb, which they said had a five-minute timer, police said. The man drove the red pickup to the checkpoint, jumped out and shouted a warning. A short time later there was a small explosion, which was believed to have been caused by the detonator going off, police said. Army &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; experts defused the bomb, one of the largest ever found in Northern Ireland, police said. The &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; said there was only minimal damage and no one was injured. On Oct. 24, the IRA staged three human &lt;b&gt; bomb &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; attacks &lt;/b&gt; which &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; six &lt;b&gt; soldiers &lt;/b&gt; and a civilian, who drove one of the bombs to the &lt;b&gt; army &lt;/b&gt; targets. The IRA is &lt;b&gt; fighting &lt;/b&gt; British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland, under socialist rule. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  bush president reagan house white administration american washington summit secretary bush\\'s baker fitzwater leaders economic americans america vice george office &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.367729126260073  \\n   As George Bush approaches the high noon of his quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he is striving to move out of the shadow cast by President Reagan while seeking to capitalize on Reagan\\'s enormous popularity. Reagan\\'s shadow has already shortened for Bush. These days he is seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the president. Instead, the questions now center on whether his candidacy is exerting too much influence over the Reagan White House. Both Bush and Reagan in recent days have fended off suggestions that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort to help the Bush campaign. And confronted with public opinion polls showing Bush far behind among Democrats who voted for Reagan, Bush advisers have now switched strategy to make sure that the Reagan shadow doesn\\'t disappear altogether. After first planning no contact at the Republican National Convention between Reagan and his &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president, a joint rally is now scheduled for Tuesday in New Orleans. It follows an upbeat joint appearance between Reagan and Bush at a rally last Friday for senior &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; officials at the Old Executive Office Building, during which Reagan lavished praise on his &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. If all goes as planned, Bush\\'s transformation into his own man will be complete when he accepts the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, according to aides and GOP consultants. By the end of the convention, ``all the emphasis is going to be on George Bush and his &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; presidential nominee,\\'\\' said his chief of staff, Craig Fuller. Lee Atwater, Bush\\'s campaign manager, said that Bush ``has made a conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to the president.\\'\\' ``And now that he\\'s running for the &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; himself, he\\'s talking about how he feels, what he believes in, and where he wants to take the country,\\'\\' Atwater said. To be sure, there are some areas in which Bush does not want to put much light between himself and Reagan _ largely the current &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; expansion, now in a peacetime record of 69 months, and the fact that most of the world is at peace. The &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; has been inching away from his close identification with &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; policies since he and aides huddled for a week in late May at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine. The consensus from his advisers was near-unanimous: he had to do more to establish his own agenda. Since then, Bush has hinted that he would be more aggressive in dealing with the Soviets, would enforce civil-rights laws more vigorously, would spend more on education and do more to clean up the environment than the &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; he has served for the past 7{ years. He has also proposed many of his own initiatives, including a $2.2 billion child care program, a ban on offshore ocean dumping, and a reorganizaton of the anti-drug effort under the &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. He also has proposed a new White House ethics &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and a ``flexible freeze\\'\\' on federal spending. But most of Bush\\'s moves away from the &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; have been cautious, for fear of appearing disloyal. ``I\\'m not going to change just to emerge from a shadow,\\'\\' he has said. In a recent interview, Bush said he will differ with Reagan when he feels he has a different set of goals. ``I have every intention of saying, here is what we\\'ve done and and here are my priorities. ``But I\\'m not doing that to quote distance myself, to show my own identity,\\'\\' he continued. ``I\\'m doing it to say, look, here is what we\\'ve done. Here are the successes, and here are the shortcomings, and here\\'s what George Bush will do.\\'\\' Still, Bush\\'s close identification with the &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; continues to pose problems for him as Democrats keep driving home their ``Where is George?\\'\\' slogan. When the general election campaign heats up after Labor Day, Bush is expected to be hit repeatedly by Democrats for his role _ still vague _ in some of the less popular Reagan &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; decisions, including arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran and past support for Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Meanwhile, the impact of Bush\\'s candidacy has already been seen in a number of recent presidential decisions _ including Reagan\\'s selection last week of a Hispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to be education &lt;b&gt; secretary &lt;/b&gt; _ fulfilling in advance a Bush campaign pledge. Reagan filled two other Cabinet vacancies with people on close terms with Bush, naming former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh to succeed Edwin Meese as attorney general and Wall Street investment banker Nicholas F. Brady to follow James A. Baker III as treasury secretary. Baker resigned to run Bush\\'s campaign. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; also yielded to Bush\\'s urgings in deciding to allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in the president\\'s veto of a $299.5 billion defense authorization bill. Reagan also has picked up on some of Bush\\'s campaign themes, including advocating the death penalty for ``drug kingpins.\\'\\' ``I don\\'t think it\\'s as much a matter of Bush disagreeing or separating himself from Reagan as much as demonstrating that his agenda is a little different,\\'\\' said GOP consultant Charlie Black, who is a Bush convention adviser. And John Sears, another Republican consultant, said: ``The real moment of truth is when Bush accepts the nomination.\\'\\' ``He can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of the Reagan &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; have brought to the country. And he can prove himself presidential. In his acceptance speech, he can do it all,\\'\\' Sears said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.343152635790944  \\n   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Thank you. Thank you very much. Theresa. You\\'re an outstanding member of the North Carolina Legislature, and I know that you\\'re going to have a resounding re-election victory in November. Thank you so much. Peace, progress, opportunity. That\\'s what we\\'re here to celebrate. That\\'s the legacy of a great president, Ronald Reagan. And that will be the living legacy of the next &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; of the United States, George Bush. First, let me thank the Democratic Party &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; for televising their Convention. What I saw and heard reminded me and millions of other former Democrats why we\\'re proud to be Republicans. The Dukakis convention speech was just like the Democrat platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on spending. We\\'re not running against Bentsen and Dukakis, we\\'re running against Bentsen and Hedges. ``Governor Hedges,\\'\\' ``Governor Hedges,\\'\\' ``Governor Hedges\\'\\' tried mightily to paint over his liberal policies with pretty rhetoric. But the make-up job failed. As an old federal trade commissioner, I want to know -- whatever happened to truth in advertising? But we\\'ve come to New Orleans not to pin the tail on the donkey. We\\'re here to pin our hopes on the American future. And we\\'re not buying the Dukakis deception. Despite what he says, this election is about ideas and ideology. They do matter. They will matter to Americans who face a choice this year as stark and dramatic as any in memory. We Americans faced a similar choice in 1980. And what did we get for our choice? We got a &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; who doesn\\'t apologize for American interests _ he asserts them. We got a breakthrough in Soviet relations and the INF treaty. We got the longest &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; boom in peacetime history. It was my privilege for seven years to serve the man who made this happen _ one of America\\'s greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, for that opportunity. Today\\'s strong economy means stronger families. And we affirm the woman who chooses to work in the home. But our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions of women, and let me say to the women of America: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also ask you to have an open mind. You know better then anyone that a job _ a good job _ is absolutely basic to a family\\'s happiness and stability. That\\'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\'\\') In the past eight years, President Reagan has created an incredible jobs machine _ more jobs for more Americans than ever before. And two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs created since 1982 went to women. Good jobs, not bad jobs. Real work, not make work. That\\'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\'\\') You did it. You were the expansion. You, the women of America _ who are holding jobs as never before, who\\'ve started businesses as never before, who have invested as never before. This expansion _ it\\'s your triumph. But it was Ronald Reagan and George Bush who set in motion the forces which allowed that growth to occur and the economy to bloom. That\\'s our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.\\'\\') America is on a roll. If this great &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; upsurge is stopped, if we have a President who raises taxes again and in creases regulation again and stifles growth again _ and believe me, that\\'s what Michael Dukakis will do _ if we let the liberals back in, we lose all that progress _ your progress. &lt;/p&gt; 0.331933696413048  \\n   American officials plan to file a formal protest over Swiss security officers who jabbed a U.S. diplomat with a machine gun and roughed up a news photographer traveling with President Bush in Geneva. ``It\\'s so strange - supposedly a peace-loving nation gave us the most vicious treatment I\\'ve ever seen,\\'\\' White House press &lt;b&gt; secretary &lt;/b&gt; Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One en route home from Switzerland. Fitzwater said the U.S. government would file a formal protest over a number of incidents that occurred when Bush arrived in Geneva for a three-hour stop and again on departure. He also said White House chief of staff John Sununu was ``verbally attacked\\'\\' when he complained. ``I\\'ve never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a security force in the last 10 years,\\'\\' Fitzwater said. American chief of protocol Joseph Reed was poked in the abdomen with a machine gun in one of the airport incidents. Fitzwater said Reed would summon Swiss Ambassador Edouard Brunner and lodge a formal protest next week after Bush returns from a trip to Mexico. ``They pulled a machine gun on Ambassador Reed ... and verbally attacked the chief of staff (Sununu),\\'\\' Fitzwater said. Officers clashed with newsmen and photographers in the president\\'s party on arrival in Geneva, pushing and shoving them as they sought to approach the ramp on which Bush would leave the plane. Fitzwater said that at a hotel in Geneva later Sununu brought up the airport incident with the chief of security. He said Sununu was met with verbal abuse. Guards lined up shoulder to shoulder prevented reporters and photographers from approaching the president\\'s ramp on departure. No one could see Bush at the base of the ramp, though he and Mrs. Bush were visible when they climbed the ramp to board the aircraft. White House press aides tried to get the Swiss officers to move out of the way, and a shouting match followed. It was then that Jerome Delay, a Washington-based photographer for the French news agency Agence France-Presse, was roughed up and the machine gun shoved into Reed\\'s abdomen, Fitzwater said. Reed was trying to reboard the plane, Fitzwater said. There was no immediate word on whether Delay was hurt. The Washington bureau of the news agency said it had no word of any injuries. Fitzwater said he had not discussed the incident with Bush. There was no answer at the Swiss embassy in Washington Friday night. No separate number is listed for the ambassador. &lt;/p&gt; 0.312993868213452  \\n   The emerging Bush &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; includes prominent holdovers from the Reagan years, but with one clear and important difference: The new team is tilted far more toward pragmatists than ideologues. Bush filled three more key positions Monday and his choices were sure to set off cries of anguish from the right. Dick Thornburgh will remain attorney general and Lauro Cavazos will stay on as education secretary. Both men were late-comers to the Reagan &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; and both replaced leading ideologues, Edwin Meese III and William Bennett. The third Bush choice was Richard Darman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget. ``He\\'s put together an Eastern establishment Republican administration,\\'\\' said conservative activist Richard Viguerie. ``That\\'s discouraging.\\'\\' High-profile jobs in the next &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; are rapidly being filled, and only one Bush choice has drawn applause from conservatives _ Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire who will serve as White House chief of staff. The voting machines had hardly stopped humming with Bush\\'s 40-state Election Day victory when the president-elect made the most obvious choice for his new &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; _ friend, adviser and campaign chairman James A. Baker III to succeed George Shultz as &lt;b&gt; secretary &lt;/b&gt; of state. During his tenure as White House chief of staff Baker earned a reputation as a quintessential pragmatist, a savvy insider who repeatedly gave low priority to the initiatives of the more ideological elements in the Reagan administration. Calls on Reagan to fire Baker were always sure applause lines at conservative gatherings. Baker\\'s deputy was Darman. Quick to follow the Baker selection was that of another old Bush friend and adviser, Nicholas Brady. He will remain treasury secretary. In fact, another characteristic of the Bush appointees is how many have long-standing ties to the president-elect. When Ronald Reagan was filling out his &lt;b&gt; administration &lt;/b&gt; eight years ago, he was meeting many of the top officials for the first time. The same was true of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. Not so with Bush. His relationships with the people he has appointed goes back many years. That should not be surprising, considering the years Bush has served in governmental and party posts. The long resume he touted during the presidential campaign put him in close contact with other up-and-coming Republicans. No one ever described Bush as an ideologue and, clearly, the people he feels most comfortable with are as pragmatic as he. It\\'s always tough to get the jump on a new &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; and name his Cabinet for him. But so far there have been no big surprises, no choices from other than the names subject to the most speculation. The names being mentioned for the remaining national security jobs are former Texas Sen. John Tower for Defense and Brent Scowcroft for national security adviser or CIA director. Scowcroft was national security adviser to President Ford and is an establishment figure. One conservative favorite whose name is frequently mentioned for a Cabinet post is former New York Rep. Jack Kemp. But Kemp is most often mentioned as either Labor or Housing secretary, the two areas where he is least-stringently ideological. The former Buffalo congressman has always enjoyed good relations with traditionally Democratic unions and his major urban initiative is a proposal for enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate in neighborhoods with high unemployment. Neither post would make Kemp a major player in areas where his more ideological views on monetary and tax policy would have influence. Bush may yet come up with some appointees who will please hard-line conservatives, but there is no sign of a Bennett, a James Watt or a Donald Hodel waiting in the wings. &lt;/p&gt; 0.288170522493812  \\n   President Bush complained testily Thursday about news accounts which he said portrayed him as deceptive, declaring he would hold fewer news conferences and initiate a ``new approach\\'\\' toward reporters. ``From now on, it\\'s going to be a little different. ... So we\\'ve got a new relationship,\\'\\' Bush told reporters traveling with him aboard Air Force One to the four-nation Colombia drug summit. ``It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it\\'s different,\\'\\' said the president, who has averaged one question and answer session with reporters each week since taking &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; 13 months ago. Later, Bush\\'s press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; was ``just kidding\\'\\' in asserting that he would have fewer news conferences and in declining comment on a series of questions. ``He was having fun,\\'\\' Fitzwater said. The president, who apparently read a wire service account of his testy mood on the plane, protested to reporters later: ``I\\'m not fuming.\\'\\' Bush\\'s pique apparently was triggered by an ABC-TV report Wednesday night recapping instances in which Bush\\'s words were belied by subsequent events. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; was criticized on the same score in a Feb. 26 article in The New Republic entitled, ``The Deceiving Line.\\'\\' Most recently Bush told a news conference on Monday that it wasn\\'t time yet for a conference among the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France on the future status of Germany. ``Not at this juncture,\\'\\' he told the news conference. Yet, the next day, a major agreement was announced in Ottawa by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a German reunification push that would include a &lt;b&gt; summit &lt;/b&gt; among the four powers that vanquished Germany in World War II. ``When I told you ... that I didn\\'t think there\\'d be a deal and there shortly was a deal, then I\\'m hit for deceiving you,\\'\\' Bush groused Thursday. Bush, a onetime CIA director, has conducted much of his foreign policy in secrecy. Two missions to China by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft came despite a Bush announcement in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown that he was barring high-level exchanges between the two countries. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; later insisted that Scowcroft\\'s trips to Beijing were ``visits\\'\\' and not ``exchanges,\\'\\' and thus not covered by the Bush edict. Bush, who usually maintains a bantering relationship with reporters, said, ``I think we\\'ve had too many press conferences. It overdoes it. It\\'s overexposure.\\'\\' By answering few questions directly, he said, ``I\\'m not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive.\\'\\' The president, who slept the night before on Air Force One so he would be well-rested for Thursday\\'s pre-dawn flight here, even gave a prickly response when asked if he had gotten a good night\\'s sleep. ``I had a very good night\\'s sleep. I can\\'t get into the details of that because some will say it\\'s too much sleep, some will say it\\'s too little. ...,\\'\\' he said. Bush parried a series of questions from reporters, most of them dealing with the drug summit. ``I\\'m not going to discuss what I\\'m going to bring up,\\'\\' Bush said when asked about his agenda for the day\\'s conference in Cartagena with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. ``I\\'m not going to discuss whether there\\'s any surprises or not. This is a new thing. This is a new approach.\\'\\' He then said his non-answers were ``a trial run\\'\\' for later dealings with the media. In fact, Bush, who answers reporters questions about once a week, planned to finish his day in Colombia with yet another news conference. Bush\\'s comments with reporters came shortly before his jet touched down here, where a U.S. press center was set up at the airport. Bush flew by helicopter the 60 miles to Cartagena and was returning here before flying home to Washington. Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio Barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to extradite them to the United States if they turned over drug labs, Bush snapped: ``I have no comment whatsoever on that. I have no comment on whether I know about it or not. I can\\'t comment on whether it\\'s true or not.\\'\\' Bush did not mention which particular news reports had irked him the most. However, Thursday\\'s editions of the Washington Post had a story on what it called ``the debate between President Bush and the press over secrecy and deception.\\'\\' And ABC-TV had a news report on Wednesday night by White House correspondent Brit Hume on the same subject. Hume was one of several reporters invited to a recent off the record lunch at the White House with Bush, at which the subject reportedly came up. News accounts said that Bush told the reporters at the lunch that he had undertaken no further secret diplomatic missions _ like Scowcroft\\'s clandestine visits to China. Then, the next day, it was disclosed that Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger had gone on a secret mission to London to notify U.S. allies of Bush\\'s latest plan to reduce troops in Europe. Bush also gave what some have seen as misleading comments on his surprise seaside &lt;b&gt; summit &lt;/b&gt; at Malta in December with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The &lt;b&gt; president &lt;/b&gt; in September had said that there were no plans for a superpower &lt;b&gt; summit &lt;/b&gt; before 1990, but he later revealed that the session had been arranged as early as last July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  company stock offer corp companies billion business sale share agreement firm sell deal company\\'s bid takeover york shares board announced &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.717134029243594  \\n   Irving Bank Corp. is backing a sweetened merger &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; from Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, which rival Bank of New York Corp. contends is still inferior to its own hostile bid. Irving said on Tuesday that its management had negotiated an amendment to the outstanding &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; by Banca Commerciale, Italy\\'s second largest bank, for 51 percent of Irving\\'s common &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; to include a dividend in the form of &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; warrants to Irving shareholders. Irving said the sweetened &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; made the overall transaction worth at least $79.50 per share, which the bank holding &lt;b&gt; company\\'s &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors deemed superior to Bank of New York\\'s ``best and final bid.\\'\\' Under a complex restructuring plan that also would include the &lt;b&gt; sale &lt;/b&gt; of assets and a special cash dividend, Banca Commerciale has offered $80 cash a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; for 51 percent of Irving\\'s common stock, or a total of about $760 million. The new &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; also provides for Irving to distribute a dividend in the form of &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; warrants to all Irving shareholders before the Banca Commerciale tender offer. The warrants, one for every four &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of Irving stock, would have a term of seven years and an exercise price of $65 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of Irving stock. The new &lt;b&gt; deal &lt;/b&gt; means Banca Commerciale would be offering the same amount of money for Irving &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; even though the &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; would be worth less to the Italian bank because of the distribution by Irving. Irving said BCI\\'s financial adviser, Lazard Freres &amp; Co., put the value of the warrants to shareholders at $4 to $7 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of Irving common stock. Irving &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; closed at $71.37{ per share, up 12{ cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday. Bank of New York rose $1.25 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; to $36.12{. Bank of New York responded that its &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; for all of Irving\\'s &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; remained superior. Owen Brady, a spokesman for Bank of New York, said BNY\\'s financial adviser Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. projected that if Irving &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; sold for $45 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; after a merger with BCI, the warrants effectively would add no more than $1.35 per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; in value to BCI\\'s previous offer. Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of its own &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; for each of Irving\\'s common &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; outstanding. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; is valued at around $68 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; or $1.2 billion. Bank of New York has offered to sweeten its &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; by slightly raising the &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; portion of the &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; and adding other shareholder incentives, including a special cash dividend, if Irving agreed to abandon its anti-takeover ``poison pill.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; also has gone to court seeking to remove the defensive mechanism, which would make an unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive. Irving steadfastly has rejected Bank of New York\\'s &lt;b&gt; takeover &lt;/b&gt; advances, which surfaced last September. Estimates of the value of the offers have differed widely. The Irving &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; said analyses by its advisers, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc., said the Banca Commerciale &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; was worth $74 to $79.50 a share. Robert Felise, an executive vice president at Irving, said a separate analysis by Lazard Freres valued the sweetened BCI &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at $80 or more per share. BCI\\'s advisers valued the Bank of New York &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at $72 to $77 a share. &lt;/p&gt; 0.708517320038874  \\n   Santa Fe Pacific Corp. has &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; it will split into three independent entities on Dec. 4. in a move it says will benefit shareholders. The railroad, energy and real-estate conglomerate said Monday that its &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors approved a previously &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; plan to spin off Santa Fe Energy Resources and Catellus Development Corp., formerly Santa Fe Pacific Realty, to shareholders. Santa Fe stockholders of record as of Nov. 29 will receive a special, tax-free dividend consisting of one &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of common &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; of Santa Fe Energy Resources for every 3.3 &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of Santa Fe Pacific held, and one &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; of Catellus for every 4 &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; of Santa Fe Pacific. Distributions of fractional &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; will be settled in cash. The spinoffs will leave the Chicago-based parent &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; with three interests: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and a 44 percent stake in Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines. Santa Fe &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; in April its plan to spin off the Houston-based energy and San Francisco-based real-estate units as part of a far-reaching restructuring program begun in 1987. Chairman Robert Krebs said in a statement that the values of Santa Fe\\'s diversified assets have not been reflected in Santa Fe\\'s &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; price. Santa Fe Pacific &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; closed 25 cents lower at $13 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. ``Our stockholders should benefit from this separation because it will place a spotlight on the values inherent in those companies,\\'\\' he said. ``In addition, the directors, management and employees of all three &lt;b&gt; companies &lt;/b&gt; will now be able to focus their energies on better utilizing and developing their assets,\\'\\' he said. Santa Fe previously sold 18.3 percent of Santa Fe Energy Resources to the public. Its &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Santa Fe also has sold a 20 percent stake in the real-estate subsidiary to a limited partnership formed by JMB Realty Corp. and the California Public Employees Retirement System. Santa Fe said Catellus has been approved for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt; 0.659351800130039  \\n   Societe Generale de Belgique SA said Thursday it is ready to continue talks with Robert Maxwell that could result in the British publisher gaining a stake in Belgium\\'s largest holding company. Maxwell and Societe Generale agreed in June to cooperate in creating a joint venture in communications, and the two sides had broached the possibility of Maxwell acquiring &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; in Societe Generale. But the negotiations were interrupted when Maxwell turned his attention to Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publishing and information services &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; he has offered to acquire for $2.47 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; in cash. This week Macmillan agreed to a $2.5 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; cash-and-securities buyout by the investment &lt;b&gt; firm &lt;/b&gt; Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., but Maxwell said he was mulling his options. On Wednesday, Maxwell said he remained interested in acquiring a stake in Societe Generale and that talks may resume soon. A spokesman for Societe Generale said, ``We continue to be interested in having more international shareholders.\\'\\' Maxwell appears primarily drawn to Societe Generale\\'s media interests, which are concentrated in Tractebel SA. &lt;/p&gt; 0.643430305298964  \\n   British publisher Robert Maxwell said Friday he will launch a $2.1 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; cash tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; for Macmillan Inc. next week, but made clear his main interest is acquiring its information services business. Macmillan already is the subject of a $1.9 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; bid &lt;/b&gt; from Robert M. Bass Group Inc., a Texas-based investment group. In a letter to Macmillan, Maxwell said he would drop his $80-a-share tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; if Macmillan would &lt;b&gt; sell &lt;/b&gt; him the information company, which Macmillan proposed to separate from its publishing &lt;b&gt; business &lt;/b&gt; in a corporate restructuring. Maxwell said his Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC would be willing to pay ``not less than $1.1 billion\\'\\' in cash for the information business, noting that Macmillan\\'s investment bankers had valued it at ``a range of $800 million to slightly in excess of $1 billion.\\'\\' In the letter, Maxwell also told Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans he was ``willing to explore other forms of transactions with you\\'\\' that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold a significant stake in the company. Maxwell also reitereated he wanted to retain Macmillan management. Macmillan declined to comment on Maxwell\\'s proposals. On Wall Street, the price of Macmillan &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; rose $1.50 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; to $83.25, indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate. ``Some people suggested Maxwell isn\\'t serious, but by launching a tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at $80 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; on Monday, we see he is serious,\\'\\' said Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing &lt;b&gt; business &lt;/b&gt; for the brokerage Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. But Boksen said by making the alternate suggestion that he be sold the information assets, Maxwell ``identified the piece he is most interested in.\\'\\' ``I think Macmillan is backed up against the wall and will try to find a white knight,\\'\\' he said. He said Macmillan could be worth $90 a share. The overture from Maxwell came only three days before a scheduled court hearing in Delaware on whether Macmillan should be allowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring. The restructuring, &lt;b&gt; announced &lt;/b&gt; in late May, would split the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; into separate publishing and information services concerns and pay shareholders a special dividend of $52.35 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; in cash. That plan was advanced after the Bass Group proposed to pay $64 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; for the Macmillan &lt;b&gt; stock &lt;/b&gt; it did not already own. The Bass Group subsequently sweetened its &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; twice, and launched its own tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; for Macmillan at $75 a share. The Bass Group won an order from Delaware Chancery Court blocking Macmillan from proceeding with its restructuring. Macmillan appealed the decision to Delaware Supreme Court, which scheduled a hearing for Monday. Maxwell disclosed his interest in Macmillan in mid-July, saying he would be interested in paying $80 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; for its 25.9 million &lt;b&gt; shares &lt;/b&gt; in a friendly transaction. A Maxwell spokesman said Friday that the tender &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; at that price would commence on Monday. It is contingent on dropping the restructuring plan, among other things, but Maxwell said it is not conditioned upon obtaining necessary financing. Late last month, the Macmillan &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; rejected the $75 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; from Bass as inadequate, but took no position on the Maxwell proposal. Macmillan spokesman David Jackson refused Friday to comment on whether the &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; has since met to discuss the Maxwell proposal, or anything else. Maxwell has vowed to make Maxwell Communications one of the world\\'s biggest media and communications businesses. Through that &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; and Pergamon Press, Maxwell controls the Mirror Group of newspapers in Great Britain, is one of America\\'s largest printers of magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishing academic and scientific journals. &lt;/p&gt; 0.628296633386678  \\n   The London &lt;b&gt; firm &lt;/b&gt; Ward White Group PLC has said it is not interested in pursuing the acquisition of Payless Cashways Inc. after reviewing information about the building materials firm. ``Any interest we had is withdrawn,\\'\\' David Bick, a spokesman for Ward White, said Monday. Molson Cos. Ltd., a diversified Canadian company, also said Monday that it did not have any interest in acquiring Payless after examining public information about the company. Sanjib Choudhuri, senior vice president of corporate development and planning, declined to say why his &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; lost interest. Senior management of Payless has offered $27 a &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; to take the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; private. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; was made to thwart an unfriendly &lt;b&gt; takeover &lt;/b&gt; attempt by New York investor Asher Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., a competitor of Payless. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; by Payless management is worth $909 million. Bick said Ward White was approached by an investment banking &lt;b&gt; firm &lt;/b&gt; two or three weeks ago about Payless. He said Ward White agreed to request information about Payless because a &lt;b&gt; takeover &lt;/b&gt; seemed worth considering, but Ward White\\'s interest was never great. ``We no longer need nor want the information,\\'\\' Bick said. Ward White owns the third-largest building materials retailing chain in the United Kingdom. The Edelman-Sutherland group is Payless\\' largest shareholder with 8.1 percent of the stock. It had said for weeks that it is interested in acquiring Payless, but has not made a formal offer. The &lt;b&gt; offer &lt;/b&gt; from Payless management requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders, who have until 3 to respond. Payless has 200 stores in 26 states. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  office filed employees information documents suit lawsuit washington investigation involved allegations questions smith legal case claims pay fraud records wilson &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.504168139457143  \\n   The Justice Department is evaluating the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; against a group of CIA &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; who took 86 rare misprinted stamps from their &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and sold them for thousands of dollars, a department spokesman said Saturday. Justice Department spokesman Tom Stewart said the agency\\'s public integrity section had received the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; and that ``they deal in bringing criminal charges, if necessary.\\'\\' ``I would not want you to think that something is imminent,\\'\\' he said. The Washington Post reported in Sunday\\'s editions that the Justice Department was considering bringing criminal charges against the nine CIA employees, who discovered the rare stamps in the agency\\'s supplies and sold them. The Post quoted unidentified intelligence and Justice Department sources as saying the CIA completed an internal review of what stamp collectors call the discovery of ``the CIA invert\\'\\' and turned the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; over to the Justice Department for possible prosecution. The public integrity section is debating whether to bring charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against the employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 $1 stamps bearing an upside-down candlestick with a sheet of stamps that did not have the rare error, the newspaper said. Each member of the group kept one of the stamps and they sold the 86 remaining stamps in 1986 to a New Jersey dealer for thousands of dollars. Their identities were never made public. A CIA spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call Saturday about the case. &lt;/p&gt; 0.469120181289104  \\n   One or more people associated with Jimmy Swaggart Ministries could be targets of a reopened &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; into the slaying of a woman who left part of her estate to the television evangelist\\'s ministry. Vic Feazell, McLennan County district attorney, said Sunday his &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; is re-examining Ida Lee Baugh\\'s slaying in December 1983 and that a National Enquirer reporter\\'s new &lt;b&gt; information &lt;/b&gt; could help him resolve ``unanswered questions.\\'\\' Feazell said the inquiry was not aimed at Swaggart but could involve ``one or more individuals connected with the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at that time.\\'\\' ``What we are looking into right now is the possibility of violations of the Texas Penal Code that could include being a party to murder,\\'\\' Feazell said. Jacqueline Euna Warren was convicted in April 1984 of murder in the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; and sentenced to 99 years in prison. Mrs. Baugh, 70, of McGregor, was found stabbed and beaten and died later at a Waco hospital. Her husband, Maurice Patrick Baugh, died of heart failure five days later. In their will, the couple left all but 25 percent of their cash, not to exceed $25,000, to the ministry in Baton Rouge, La. A Swaggart spokesman estimated the couple\\'s total estate at between $500,000 and $800,000. Baugh\\'s son contested the will, charging that associates of Jimmy Swaggart ministries exercised undue influence on his parents to change their will. Larry Neale Baugh alleged that two men working on behalf of Swaggart Ministries had recommended that Ms. Warren take care of Mrs. Baugh. Later, Larry Baugh dropped his charges. The Waco Tribune-Herald quoted a source familiar with the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; as saying a settlement was reached between Baugh and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. Feazell said a National Enquirer reporter approached him with new &lt;b&gt; information &lt;/b&gt; he had developed independently. ``The &lt;b&gt; information &lt;/b&gt; was believeable and parts of it have been substantiated,\\'\\' he said. Feazell said his &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; had investigated a possible connection between the murder, the will and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at the time of Ms. Warren\\'s trial. ``Lot of &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; came to light in the spring of 1984 _ unanswered &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; that weren\\'t pursued,\\'\\' he said. ``I met with Jimmy Swaggart\\'s attorneys at that time. After meeting with him, I decided to take no further action,\\'\\' he said. Feazell said that ``as material becomes available, it could be presented to the grand jury\\'\\' during the next few weeks. ``It might be something we can wrap up rather quickly, or we could take a long time with it.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.325335618730338  \\n   A businessman with ties to the Iran-Contra affair has been sentenced to two years probation for his role in a conspiracy to sell confidential Ashland Oil Inc. &lt;b&gt; documents &lt;/b&gt; to Iran. U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum on Monday also ordered Roy M. Furmark, a private consultant in the oil industry, to &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; Ashland $15,000 in restitution. Furmark pleaded guilty in March to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Furmark, of Brooklyn, testified to Congress in 1987 that he was &lt;b&gt; involved &lt;/b&gt; in the sale of American arms to Iran. In the Ashland case, Furmark cooperated with prosecutors for more than a year before his plea and helped implicate former Ashland chairman Orin E. Atkins in the conspiracy. On Friday, Atkins, who also pleaded guilty to conspiracy, was sentenced to two years probation and 600 hours of community service for his role in the scheme. Furmark admitted that he agreed to help Atkins arrange meetings with representatives of the Iranian National Oil Co., which was contemplating a &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; against Ashland for the company\\'s decision not to &lt;b&gt; pay &lt;/b&gt; $283 million for crude oil purchased in 1979. Atkins has said he wanted to sell to the Iranians confidential &lt;b&gt; documents &lt;/b&gt; involving the disputed oil deal that he obtained after he was forced to resign as chairman in 1981 but remained as a paid Ashland consultant. While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued Ashland and last year obtained a $325 million settlement, which with interest was worth more than $500 million. ``This episode in my life has been totally uncharacteristic to my life and what I stand for,\\'\\' Furmark told Cedarbaum. ``I am deeply sorry.\\'\\' Cedarbaum said she considered Furmark\\'s cooperation in deciding his sentence. Furmark set up a meeting with Atkins in 1988 where they discussed renewed efforts to sell the &lt;b&gt; documents &lt;/b&gt; Iran. A videotape of that meeting made by investigators led to charges against Atkins. &lt;/p&gt; 0.31321698051303  \\n   A group of property owners &lt;b&gt; filed &lt;/b&gt; a damage &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday on behalf of the thousands forced to evacuate their homes after a train derailment and phosphorus fire. Named as defendants in the Christian County Circuit Court &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; were CSX Corp. and a subsidiary, CSX Transportation Inc. The complaint alleges negligence on the part of both companies, said Tim Futrell, attorney for the nine plaintiffs, residents of the Crofton and Nortonville areas. ``We are talking in terms of hundreds of millons of dollars in damages,\\'\\' Futrell said. ``Under the rules of civil procedure, you are not permitted to specify a specific amount in the complaint.\\'\\' Futrell said he believed at least 15,000 people could be affected by the case, noting that the accident on June 22 drove about that many people from their homes in seven western Kentucky counties. Lloyd Lewis, spokesman for CSX Transportation, said Tuesday he had no comment. A CXS Transportation tanker carrying phosphorus was among 34 that left the tracks in a ravine near Crofton. The phosphorus spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned more than 12 hours after the crash. There was no fatalities. Futrell said one of the ``reasons we are filing so quickly is because CSX has dispatched representatives to the area to get people to sign releases for a pittance of what they are due.\\'\\' Futrell said some people complained about scratching and itching and difficulty in breathing, and he said there was damage to tobacco and hay crops ``and perhaps to the soil itself.\\'\\' ``Virtually all of the plaintiffs were displaced for at least three days.

The &lt;b&gt; lawsuit &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; filed &lt;/b&gt; by the National Conference of Bar Examiners, or NCBE, a Chicago company that prepares the Multistate Bar Examination _ 200 multiple-choice &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; administered to law graduates in 46 states. The &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; accuses Multistate Legal Studies Inc. of Philadelphia and Santa Monica, Calif., of sending agents to purposely fail the bar exam, giving them the right to review the tests. While reviewing the exams, the agents memorized, photographed, hand copied or tape recorded the questions, according to the lawsuit. The &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; names Multistate president Robert Feinberg as an agent. Feinberg, an attorney living in California, denied the &lt;b&gt; allegations &lt;/b&gt; and noted that his company won a similar &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; filed &lt;/b&gt; in 1978. The NCBE &lt;b&gt; claims &lt;/b&gt; the ``integrity and quality of the process by which applicants are admitted to the practice of law\\'\\' was tainted by Multistate, which also operates under the name of Preliminary Multistate Bar Review. The &lt;b&gt; suit &lt;/b&gt; seeks unspecified damages as well as injunctions against further copyright infringement. According to the suit, about 100,000 students in 40 states have enrolled in the courses with Preliminary Multistate Bar Review since 1977. The three- and six-day seminars cost $295 to $495 with an additional $395 for written materials, $100 for cassette tapes and about $50 for flashcards. The Multistate Bar Exam, used since 1972, is given twice a year on six subjects. About 58,000 applicants took the exam last year. Questions are prepared by committees of practitioners, judges and law professors and reviewed by others at a cost of about $250,000 per test form. The NCBE releases 50 &lt;b&gt; questions &lt;/b&gt; to the public every other year, but does not reuse released questions. The NCBE also prepares other portions of the test, including a essay section and a section on professional responsibility. The Multistate Bar Examination is used in all states but Indiana, Iowa, Lousiana and Washington. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  water river state fish lake summer birds wildlife dam allen found trees florida north western stone reservoir fishing corps interior &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.64417734287209  \\n   Fish farmers don\\'t believe their crops are for the birds, but try telling that to a hungry duck, blackbird or heron. ``Birds are a costly problem where &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; are cultured,\\'\\' says researcher Vickie D. Martin in a new Agriculture Department report. ``Waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; at aquacultural facilities include diving ducks, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, kingfishers, blackbirds, ospreys and anhingas.\\'\\' These &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; _ the diving ducks include grebes, cormorants and mergansers _ were described as ``voracious &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; eaters\\'\\' that not only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; stock. ``Due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; they consumed are diseased, predatory &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; may transmit diseases from pond to pond,\\'\\' she said. Moreover, when &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; farmers attempt to guard against the airborne marauders, they can be frustrated because a majority of the &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; are legally categorized as migratory and are protected under federal and &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; laws. Martin, a student at Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga., worked as an intern for the department\\'s Economic Research Service the last two summers. Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; species and location, she said losses to &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; have been reported on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; and trout, and are greatest in the largest aquaculture states: Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California and Georgia. ``Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the summer,\\'\\' Martin said. ``In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers, herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late &lt;b&gt; summer &lt;/b&gt; and early fall.\\'\\' She added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to shellfish, although swans occasionally are problems. ``Catfish in the Southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas (locally called &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; turkeys) and kingfishers during the spring and &lt;b&gt; summer &lt;/b&gt; months,\\'\\' Martin said. ``Herons and cormorants cause problems year-round. Crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by purple grackles, herons, egrets, ibises, gulls, diving ducks and kingfishers.\\'\\' Fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as perimeter fencing, netting, overhead wires and other devices, including fireworks, exploders and similar items used to frighten birds. Some chemicals, such as Avitrol, a registered ``frightening agent\\'\\' for use on herring gulls and blackbirds, have also been effective, she said. But &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; and federal permits are required to use this chemical on gulls, because they are legally protected. After ingesting the chemical, the gull ``will behave erratically and emit distress calls,\\'\\' which frighten away the other birds, she said. Some migratory game &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; may be shot during the hunting season, and other permits are available for some species. Local &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; and federal &lt;b&gt; wildlife &lt;/b&gt; authorities should be contacted. Still, Martin said, some &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; farmers believe ``birds are uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile, no matter what method of control of prevention is used.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.533946644642189  \\n   Wood storks have come home to roost in southern Florida, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; won\\'t have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season. Summer deluges at the storks\\' two major ancestral breeding grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; the &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; rely on for food, they explained. Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, a National Audubon Society refuge about 20 miles &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; of Naples that was once the primary stork-nesting area in North America. Another 75 pairs have taken up residence at Everglades National Park\\'s Cuthbert Island. The two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by North America\\'s sole species of stork, a giant white bird with an iron-black head. ``We are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers,\\'\\' said Paul Hinchcliff, chief naturalist at Corkscrew. ``Whether or not there\\'s enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge enough young remains to be seen.\\'\\' Almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have ended disastrously, said John Ogden, who heads a wood stork study team at Everglades National Park. If they are unable to feed offspring, parent &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; will abandon the colony, leaving hundreds of crying young &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; to starve. Wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers at Corkscrew since 1984-85, when 353 pairs of &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; successfully raised 530 young. Fifty years ago, it was common to see 6,000 to 8,000 pairs of storks nesting in the gray-boughed cypress trees. Since the early 1960s, however, storks have been spurning Corkscrew in favor of central and northern Florida and other Southern states. Between 1960 and 1980, the wood stork nesting population at Corkscrew dropped by 75 percent. The renewed Corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the total U.S. stork population, estimated at 4,000. Historically, storks came to Corkscrew by the tens of thousands to nest in early winter, leaving plenty of time to rear offspring before the onset of rain. But human activity disrupted the annual cycle of high-water summers and low-water winters in Florida\\'s wetlands. Much of the area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions. The &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the deeper waters of the &lt;b&gt; interior &lt;/b&gt; Everglades to drop low enough for them to efficiently feed. As result, nesting is delayed, and this year\\'s young won\\'t be ready to leave their nests until about mid-July, Ogden said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.474262413270188  \\n   The red-cockaded woodpecker, once common in the Southeast, still ranges from Texas to the Carolinas, but is &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; mainly in isolated populations on federal lands. The &lt;b&gt; birds &lt;/b&gt; live in small flocks, called clans, boring nesting holes in living pine &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; about 60 or more years old. The cluster of &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; where the woodpeckers roost is called a colony. According to the U.S. Forest Service, the greatest numbers of known active colonies are &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; in the Appalachicola National Forest in Florida, with 693, the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana, with 314, and the Francis Marion National Forest in South Carolina, where the number dropped after Hurricane Hugo from 487 in 1988 to an estimated 320 to 340 today.

By September, thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly sparking a &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; emergency. ``There is no cheap solution to it and there\\'s no real cure to the problem,\\'\\' said LePage, &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; treatment superintendent in Monroe, Mich., on Lake Erie\\'s &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; edge. At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December\\'s deep freeze stopped them from clogging &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; intakes but they quickly settled inside the plant. ``They like it where it\\'s dimly lit, they like it where it\\'s warm, and they don\\'t like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal for them,\\'\\' said Robert C. Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at the plant. ``By July, we\\'re going to have a massive problem with them.\\'\\' Three years after they were introduced to North America and after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread throughout the &lt;b&gt; lake &lt;/b&gt; and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It\\'s an invasion scientists say could affect farming, &lt;b&gt; fishing &lt;/b&gt; and daily life along virtually every body of fresh &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; in North America in the next few years. The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love intake pipes of &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; and power plants because the current brings them a steady supply of fresh food. A mussel can filter more than a gallon of &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; an hour, said R. Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would certainly be a benefit, I guess,\\'\\' he said. Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds, and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said Charles O\\'Neill, with the Sea Grant program at the State University College at Brockport. The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, Flint said. But with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they could deplete the supply for the small &lt;b&gt; fish &lt;/b&gt; that support the billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry. And the bad news could spread beyond the &lt;b&gt; lake &lt;/b&gt; and its shoreline. Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; from the lakes can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because of the shells, O\\'Neill said. ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet to the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; at your tap,\\'\\' O\\'Neill said. ``It\\'s not just an environmental problem.\\'\\' Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in theory, to be edible by humans, Flint said. But when Canadian researchers tried steaming a bunch, O\\'Neill said, ``What they got was a stench that cleared the lab.\\'\\' The mussels have plagued Europe for more than a century and are believed to have arrived in North America on a freighter that emptied its ballast tanks in Lake St. Clair, upstream from Lake Erie, in 1986. Scientists are studying the possibility that the Lake Erie infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986 event, O\\'Neill said. But Flint said one colony could have infested the &lt;b&gt; lake &lt;/b&gt; because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells. ``They could easily get across Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in that period of time,\\'\\' he said. For public &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the intake pipe rather than waiting until the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; is inside the plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have already faced the problem. Power plants have a different problem, because officials are reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in cooling &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; discharged back to the lake, Henderson said. Niagara Mohawk and the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Department of Environmental Conservation are negotiating a solution. James Sell, chief operator of the Dunkirk &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; plant, is studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe\\'s mouth, like building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine pipe out through the intake. ``We\\'re better off than the people in the &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; end of the lake,\\'\\' Sell said. ``At least we have some time to do something by spring.\\'\\' The City Council hasn\\'t been persuaded to pay up to $100,000 for the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to show visitors, said, ``I don\\'t see much option for them if they want a &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; supply.\\'\\' Farther inland, many &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; officials are unaware of the problem or not prepared to do anything about it. Michael Burke, director of the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Health Department\\'s bureau of public &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; supply protection, said the department was studying the problem but doesn\\'t see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word\\'s getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in the Great Lakes. It is coming out in industry papers and things of that sort.\\'\\' O\\'Neill and other scientists said the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; should do more to get the word out, because it is only a matter of time _ and not necessarily very much time. ``The chances of them getting into the &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; reach of the Erie Canal is good,\\'\\' O\\'Neill said. ``The canal is an ideal place for them to live. It\\'s warm. It\\'s shallow. Most of it has rock riprap to attach to.\\'\\' Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their engine housings and other places where &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; collects. Once the mussels get into Lake Michigan, they will almost certainly spread through the Chicago River and into the Mississippi River basin, O\\'Neill said. ``Any area in North America that is utilizing surface &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; should be concerned.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.436668989864492  \\n   They could have been cremation pits, cock-fighting rings, animal pens, Civil War foxholes or secret hiding places for moonshine equipment. Maybe they were prehistoric Indian burial sites, charcoal pits or foundations for native American abodes. Or maybe, some say, the &lt;b&gt; stone &lt;/b&gt; circles dotting the &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; slope of Polish Mountain encircled apple &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; in the early 1900s. For more than a decade, 150 to 200 circles of sandstone rock have puzzled area residents and archaelogists. Virtually hidden by brush and poison ivy, the gray-colored rocks of various shapes and sizes are neatly arranged in circles. No one knows their purpose, or who put them there. ``Everybody that goes up there has some kind of weird theory,\\'\\' said John Mash, manager of Green Ridge State Forest, where the circles are found. ``One guy even mentioned that they could have been sweat lodges _ like a Turkish bath. ``The Indians would have these rituals when they would go into manhood,\\'\\' he said. ``They would go in these buildings with hot rocks and put &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; on them _ something like a sauna.\\'\\' But 150 to 200 saunas on one hillside in &lt;b&gt; western &lt;/b&gt; Maryland? Mash said rangers noticed the &lt;b&gt; stone &lt;/b&gt; rings in the early 1970s. In 1975, Mash contacted State Archaeologist Tyler J. Bastian, who visited the site and put the circles on a list of archaeological areas in Maryland. But it was not until last year that some archaelogists and volunteers excavated one of the circles. ``They did the dig and &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; zip, except for the rattlesnakes,\\'\\' Mash said. Hoping to uncover clues, another group conducted a dig this spring. ``In a nutshell, we didn\\'t discover anything. They still remain a mystery,\\'\\' said Charles McVeigh Jr., a member of the Western Maryland Archaeological Society. ``We dug out in the center of them. We didn\\'t go down very far before we got to bedrock. We &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; no artifacts. We &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; nothing to indicate prehistoric use.\\'\\' No future digs are planned, and two local archaeologists who took an interest in the circles, Robert D. Wall and Connie Huddleston, both have moved from Maryland. Neither could be reached for comment recently. Meanwhile, the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; forest has put the circles on its historic preservation list to ensure the five-acre tract remains untouched, Mash said. The site could be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places if additional information could be &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; to document the age of the rings, their use and significance. Mash has dismissed the moonshine theory because there is no nearby &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; source needed to make moonshine. He said he did not think they were cock-fighting rings because only one pit is needed to hold a fight. And the rings are too close together to have been foxholes during the Civil War, he said. ``The site has no strategic value,\\'\\' Mash said. ``(And) the guy in the middle foxhole is going to be shooting his own pals before he can get his bullet out to hit the bad guys.\\'\\' Until someone conjures up a more believable theory, Mash said he puts the most stock in the orchard theory _ that someone placed the stones around apple &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; that once grew in the area. There were 1 million apple &lt;b&gt; trees &lt;/b&gt; in Green Ridge by 1914, he said. ``It is possible that they hired immigrants who could not understand directions given in English and some of them were told to clear the rocks away to plant the apple trees,\\'\\' he suggested. ``They were new in America and wanted to do a nice, neat job, so they put these rocks in nice neat little circles and left a space in the middle for the tree. And they might have worked on these for a couple of days, or a week until somebody stopped them. That could be a theory ...\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  percent poll survey found conducted points error voters results margin surveys sunday apple percentage lead arthritis choice released blacks journal &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.548634839018024  \\n   President Bush has a 56 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; approval rating among blacks, a huge increase over the ratings given former President Reagan, according to a new CBS News-New York Times poll. Only 13 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; supported Reagan at about the same point in his presidency, CBS Evening News reported Thursday. In May 1982, Reagan had a 73 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproval rating among blacks; in the current poll, 26 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; surveyed disapproved of Bush, said Kathleen A. Frankovic, of the CBS network\\'s polling division. CBS-Times polls &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; during Reagan\\'s entire time in office &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; he had an average 67 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproval rating among blacks, Frankovic said. The new &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; is the fourth consecutive Times-CBS News &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; in the last six months in which a majority of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; said they approved of Bush\\'s handling of his job, the Times reported in today\\'s editions. For the last 30 years, five out of six &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; have voted for the Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who the nominee was, CBS reported. In the new poll, one out of 10 &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; said they probably would vote for Bush against a Democratic candidate in 1992, while another 20 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said their &lt;b&gt; choice &lt;/b&gt; would depend on who was running, the Times said. One-third of the &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; surveyed, and 46 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the whites, said their opinion of Bush had improved since he became president, the Times said. Blacks were evenly divided on whether Bush is doing a good job handling the war on drugs, while whites approved 56 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 35 percent, the Times said. White respondents gave Bush an overall approval rating of 75 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 14 percent. The telephone &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; of 1,515 adult Americans, including 403 blacks, was &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; March 30-April 2.

Michael Dukakis, while another &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; indicates the Republican nominee-to-be is only slightly behind his Democratic rival. The new &lt;b&gt; results &lt;/b&gt; contrast with a series of &lt;b&gt; surveys &lt;/b&gt; in recent weeks indicating Bush trailed Dukakis in double digits. A telephone &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; of 1,013 adults last week by ABC News and Money Magazine, &lt;b&gt; released &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; 45 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; support for Dukakis and 42 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; for Bush. That amounts to a tie, given the &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; of plus or minus 4 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; points. And a Gallup &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; of 1,210 voters, also out Wednesday, suggested Dukakis had the support of 46 percent, to 41 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; for Bush. The &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; was 3 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; points. By contrast, Gallup, NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Washington Post polls &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; since June 9 have &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; double-digit leads for Dukakis. The Post survey, done June 15-19, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a 51-39 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; Dukakis margin. The ABC-Money Magazine poll, &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; June 22-25, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; support for Dukakis down 7 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; from an ABC-Post &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; in mid-May that used the same methodology. Bush rose only from 41 to 42 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; support; those who didn\\'t know grew from 2 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 6 percent. The rest said they wouldn\\'t vote or would support someone else. Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories. A Harris &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; early this month &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a dead heat _ 49-44, with a 3-point &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; _ and a USA Today-CNN &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; gave Dukakis a single-digit lead. The ABC-Money Magazine &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; had Dukakis leading among women, respondents earning less than $25,000 a year and adults aged 35 to 54. Bush led among men, respondents earning more than $50,000 and those in the 55-64 age group. &lt;/p&gt; 0.415575222157962  \\n   Public approval of President Bush\\'s handling of the economy and his handling of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait dropped in recent weeks, according to a CBS News-New York Times &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; released &lt;/b&gt; Saturday. Bush\\'s 60 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; overall approval rating in the &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; is the worst of his presidency, but still higher than that recorded for Presidents Reagan and Carter at the same point in their administrations. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a majority of Americans still approves of Bush\\'s actions in the Persian Gulf, but the 57 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; approval rating is down from 75 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; soon after the invasion. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; 34 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproved of Bush\\'s handling of Iraq. Asked to rate Bush\\'s handling of the economy, 52 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they disapproved and 36 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they approved. In August, 45 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; approved of Bush\\'s handling of the economy, and 44 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproved. Amid heightened concern over Bush\\'s handling of the economy and the budget deficit, 30 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they disapproved of his overall performance - the highest level of his presidency in the CBS-New York Times poll. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; among a random sample of 960 adults around the United States interviewed by telephone Monday through Wednesday. Results of such a &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; should generally be accurate to within 3 &lt;b&gt; percentage &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; in either direction. &lt;/p&gt; 0.411847762705052  \\n   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis begins his race against Republican George Bush with a 12-point advantage, according to an ABC News poll. The network reported Thursday that Dukakis leaped to a 53-41 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; in a &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; of 450 registered &lt;b&gt; voters &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, up from his 45-46 virtual dead heat with Bush in ABC\\'s &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; Sunday. The movement was 13 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; _ from 1 point down to 12 up. The jump was expected; polls in other elections have &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; that nominees often gain support immediately after their party\\'s convention. Such bumps frequently settle back down as &lt;b&gt; voters &lt;/b&gt; focus on the substance of the race. The &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; reflected the success of Dukakis\\' peacemaking with Jesse Jackson, his opponent for the nomination. Sixty-eight &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said Dukakis was treating Jackson fairly, up from 52 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in a &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; early this month. Similarly, 70 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said Jackson was treating Dukakis fairly, and the share of respondents with an unfavorable view of Jackson fell 11 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; from Sunday, to 31 percent. Those with a favorable view rose 9 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; to 52. The national &lt;b&gt; survey &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; a rise in unfavorable views of Bush, who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week. His favorable rating fell from 49 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 41 percent, while those viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; Sunday to 44 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday. The poll, completed the day before Dukakis appeared at the convention, &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; little change in his favorable-unfavorable rating, 55-21. Dukakis\\' 12-point &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; against Bush did not mark his greatest numerical advantage in an ABC poll; the Massachusetts governor led by 53-40 in late May. The &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; for the new &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; was 5 points. Such single-day surveys, particularly when &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; during or just after a highly publicized event, tend to measure visceral reactions rther than considered opinion, so the views they gauge can change rapidly. Dukakis continued to do better with women &lt;b&gt; voters &lt;/b&gt; than with men, and the &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; Wednesday &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; that he had gained more ground among women _ leading Bush by 25 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; in the new poll, up from an 8-point &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; Sunday. Dukakis scored a tie with Bush among men, after a 12-point Bush &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; Sunday. Dukakis improved with independents, scoring 48-42 against Bush after a 52-35 &lt;b&gt; lead &lt;/b&gt; for Bush among independents Sunday. And 59 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Democrats who had bolted the party to vote for President Reagan favored Dukakis now. In another measure of the convention\\'s impact, 52 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said the Democrats could be trusted to do a better job with the nation\\'s problems, up 9 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; from Sunday. And 40 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; said they generally approved of the proceedings in Atlanta, while just 13 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; disapproved. Nearly half said they had not been paying enough attention to say. &lt;/p&gt; 0.399764014728187  \\n   The Associated Press &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; on homelessness was &lt;b&gt; conducted &lt;/b&gt; by telephone Dec. 5-9 among a random sample of 1,004 adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa. The &lt;b&gt; results &lt;/b&gt; were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The &lt;b&gt; poll &lt;/b&gt; had a three-point &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; of sampling error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within three &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; margin &lt;/b&gt; is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential &lt;b&gt; error &lt;/b&gt; in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. Is your knowledge of the homeless a result of something you have seen or dealt with in person, or is it just based on news reports and word of mouth? In person: 45 percent. Word of mouth: 54 percent. Don\\'t know or no answer: 2 percent. 2. Which of the following statements best reflects your attitude toward the homeless in the United States today? - The homeless themselves are mainly at fault because of their unwillingness to work or their behavior, such as alcohol or drug use: 17 percent. - Our society is mainly at fault because we do not provide sufficient housing for them: 20 percent. - Neither the homeless nor society is mainly at fault because they become homeless through tough breaks or bad economic luck: 41 percent. - (volunteered answer) Combination of both homeless and society: 17 percent. - Don\\'t know or no answer: 5 percent. 3. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should be increased, decreased, or remain the same? Increased: 58 percent. Decreased: 7 percent. Remain the same: 23 percent. DK-NA: 12 percent. (For those who said increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for that? Yes: 75 percent. No: 22 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent. 4. I\\'m going to ask you to rate the chances that you or a member of your family could become homeless in the coming year. Do you personally feel the chances are ... Very likely: 4 percent. Somewhat likely: 11 percent. Somewhat unlikely: 16 percent. Not at all likely: 67 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent. 5. Do you know someone who has become homeless in the last year? Yes: 15 percent. No: 85 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  police people bus violence injured demonstrators protest capital protesters today city building security arrested students protests killed fired streets fire &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.584121179491273  \\n   Police in western Bangladesh opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; on transport workers striking against alleged &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; harassment and 15 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were injured, according to news reports Sunday. The indefinite strike halted &lt;b&gt; bus &lt;/b&gt; traffic in 16 districts and stranded thousands of &lt;b&gt; bus &lt;/b&gt; passengers, the government-owned Dainik Bangla newspaper reported. Police and &lt;b&gt; demonstrators &lt;/b&gt; clashed in Pabna, 75 miles northwest of Dhaka, the paper said, but it did not specify how many of the &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; and how many were police. It also did not say how many were wounded by the gunfire. Police said they opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; when the workers tried to storm an office of the road transport authority. On Saturday, 50 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; when pro-government workers and opposition-backed laborers clashed, using homemade bombs and knives, over the ouster of a union leader in Adamjee, 10 miles south of Dhaka, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.518228157417174  \\n   Hundreds of policemen deserted their posts or stayed home &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; after anti-monarchist mobs beat to death six of their colleagues in daylong rioting, government sources said. At least three &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; stations in the &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; were seen to be empty. Almost none of the capital\\'s 4,000 policemen were walking the streets. A few armed policemen entered deserted &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; stations late &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; but allowed no one to enter. A 10-hour curfew restricting &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; to their homes began at 7 p.m. and some policemen in jeeps and trucks patrolled the city. Monday\\'s &lt;b&gt; violence &lt;/b&gt; was the worst since April 6, when &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; on pro-democracy demonstrators, and threatened the fledgling pro-democracy movement in this Himalayan kingdom. Until this month, King Birendra had exercised virtually absolute power. Five civilians were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; gunfire in Monday\\'s unrest and, according to the state-owned Rashtriya Samachar Samiti news agency, 15 policemen were missing. Only one policeman had been found by late today. The mobs accused &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; of condoning and sometimes joining an underground pro-monarchist group blamed for a wave of crime since a new government headed by pro-democracy forces took office last week. Two policemen captured early Monday were beaten for more than six hours before they died. Four more policemen were dragged from a &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; station and lynched by hundreds of people. The crowds also set afire the zonal commissioner\\'s office, which houses a &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; station. Today, two policemen in riot gear stood guard outside the charred building. They were the only policemen seen on foot during an hour-long tour of Katmandu. ``There are no policemen anywhere in the city,\\'\\' said a taxi driver who said he had been driving the &lt;b&gt; streets &lt;/b&gt; for six hours. ``Even traffic policemen are absent today.\\'\\' One government source said the policemen were either ``unofficially withdrawn or are too scared to come out.\\'\\' Senior &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; officials could not be located for comment. But shops opened and &lt;b&gt; streets &lt;/b&gt; were clogged with traffic &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; after a ten-hour curfew clamped on Monday night was lifted at 6 a.m.. There were no reports of violence. ``The tremendous amount of confidence the &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have in this government is compensating for the absence of police,\\'\\' said Home Minister Yog Prasad Upadhyay. ``This is apparent from the fact that ... the country is peaceful.\\'\\' Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai met with King Birendra &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; to discuss the situation, officials said. No details of the meeting were available. A scheduled meeting of the Cabinet was postponed, officials said on condition of anonymity. There had been indications a shake-up in the top ranks of the &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; force might be forthcoming after the Cabinet meeting. Bhattarai and his government, a coalition of democrats, Communists, royalists and independents, took office last Thursday after an eight-week campaign against the previous regime, which was subservient to the king. King Birendra caved in to the campaign on April 8, two days after &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; shot and &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; 200 &lt;b&gt; demonstrators &lt;/b&gt; as they marched on the palace, according to witnesses. The government said 10 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and 107 wounded in all of Nepal on that day, but two days later Birendra lifted a 29-year ban on political parties. Within 24 hours of the new government taking office, the &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; of 250,000 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; was faced with a rash of arson, mugging and looting, which residents blamed on a right-wing pro-monarchist group called Mandale. The Mandale, an abbreviated form of Nepal Vidyarthi Mandal, or Nepal &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; group, went underground in 1979 after Birendra officially banned the group because of its violent tendencies. &lt;/p&gt; 0.477138331219829  \\n   Five radical &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; armed with bombs and knives seized a U.S. Information Service office &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; and detonated two bombs and started a &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; before &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; overpowered them. Two of the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; brandishing explosive devices and draped in South Korean flags stood at shattered windows on the second floor yelling ``Yankee go home\\'\\' as riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; ringed the building. U.S. Embassy officials said they had no reports of injuries, but the attackers smashed windows and set a &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; in a periodical storage room. Thick smoke filled part of the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; located in the heart of Seoul. People inside the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; at the time of the attack, including at least one American, were not detained by the radicals. The students, who said they were members of the ``Young Student Suicide Group\\'\\' claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed at surrounding &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; to stay away. They tossed down a statement charging the United States was attempting to make South Korea a colony. ``Yankees stay out of Korea,\\'\\' the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; yelled. A &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; officer said it was unclear how many of the explosive devices the attackers had. The bombs were crude chemical devices, possibly some kind of plastic explosive, he said. About 200 radical &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; about an hour later outside Myungdong Cathedral. Police &lt;b&gt; fired &lt;/b&gt; volleys of tear gas at the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; who yelled slogans denouncing President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who is to be sworn in Thursday. Hundreds of &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; had gathered at the cathedral less than a mile from the U.S. Information Service office earlier in the afternoon for an anti-government protest. ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,\\'\\' the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; yelled. Some of the attackers were reading in the office\\'s library when there was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenly pulled out bombs and started screaming slogans, eyewitnesses said. At least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it, they said. ``He was kind of crazy-eyed,\\'\\' said Paul Wadden, a visiting American teacher who was reading in the library at the time. The attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main street outside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the street and brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters. Riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; stood on the sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shattered glass covered the street. The &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; tossed at least one bomb into the street where it exploded harmlessly, eyewitnesses said. A second bomb was tossed out, but did not explode, they said. People caught in the library said the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; did not attempt to detain them and they were able to leave after recovering from their initial shock. Wadden said he and other &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were prevented from leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; guards. There were about 40 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; in the library at the time, most of them Koreans, eyewitnesses said. Police who entered the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; by the rear entrance overpowered the &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; about 30 minutes after the attack began. The &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; were taken out of the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; in a &lt;b&gt; bus &lt;/b&gt; with covered windows. U.S. Embassy officials said South Korean riot &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; entered the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; at their request. Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita arrived at the Lotte Hotel across the street from the U.S. Information Service office just as the incident ended, officials said. Takeshita is in Seoul for Roh\\'s inauguration. American diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know why the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; attacked the U.S. facility. ``We have no idea what the motivation was,\\'\\' an embassy official said. The United States is South Korea\\'s chief ally. Washington has 40,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against communist North Korea. The U.S. Information Service provides reading material and other materials on the United States and operates libraries and information centers around the world in conjunction with American embassies. The service office in Seoul is located about half a mile from the American Embassy. The same office was seized by 73 radical &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; for four days in May, 1985 as an anti-American protest. They ended the occupation peacefully and some later received prison sentences. U.S. Embassy officials were unable to explain &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; how the attackers were able to bring weapons into the well-guarded building. Visitors must pass a metal detector, present identification and have their bags searched and there are &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; guards inside and outside. The statement by the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; denounced Roh as a puppet who had been installed by the United States. South Korean radicals have repeatedly charged the United States has kept a series of authoritarian governments in power in South Korea. Roh, a former general, won the first democratic elections in 16 years last December. &lt;/p&gt; 0.475636300053292  \\n   Police clashed with about 250 stone-throwing Moslem fundamentalists who attacked a theater troupe, a &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; source said Wednesday. One student was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and four were &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; as officers dispersed the crowd. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incident took place Tuesday night at the village of Kodeya, 25 miles from the southern provincial &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; of Assiut. He said it wasn\\'t known what &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; 23-year-old Mohammed Kotb. One of the four wounded &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; was in critical condition, he added. In a statement read to The Associated Press by telephone, a fundamentalist spokesman claimed the student was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; gunfire. ``The Moslem group went out through the village in a peaceful march of &lt;b&gt; protest &lt;/b&gt; ... when &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; attacked them with tear gas and opened &lt;b&gt; fire &lt;/b&gt; on the demonstrators, killing the student Mohammed Kotb,\\'\\' the statement said. The spokesman, who refused to give his name, said forces then surrounded the village, raided homes and detained fundamentalists. The spokesman said the &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; were protesting a ``dancing party\\'\\' organized by &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; forces. The &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; source, however, said the fundamentalists attacked a theater troupe performing a play about Islam and peasants. The troup had been invited to perform by the government\\'s culture club at the village. ``Around 250 Moslem fundamentalists from the village and nearby villages gathered in a mosque after evening prayers and then moved to the hall where the play was being performed, carrying stones and rocks,\\'\\' the source said. He said the students, from a teacher training college, ``attacked the hall and tried to destroy the building,\\'\\' but &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; forces surrounded them and used tear gas and sticks to disperse them. He did not say whether &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; made any arrests. Police forces guarded the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; until the play was finished, the source said. The southern Assiut province has been a hotbed of fundamentalist agitation for almost a decade. Fundamentalist &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; armed with knives, bicycle chains and stones, attacked an Assiut University campus parade on March 7, denouncing it as an anti-Islamic ``dancing and singing party.\\'\\' In the ensuing clash with &lt;b&gt; security &lt;/b&gt; forces, two &lt;b&gt; students &lt;/b&gt; and two policemen were wounded. &lt;/p&gt; 0.449178970764982  \\n   Thousands marching against government austerity measures fled in panic Thursday when &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; fired &lt;/b&gt; rifles and tear gas after hooded youths smashed store windows. Three &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were injured, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. The &lt;b&gt; violence &lt;/b&gt; came 11 months after rioting left about 300 dead following &lt;b&gt; protests &lt;/b&gt; over subsidy cuts on food and public transportation. About 8,000 union members and supporters marched in the &lt;b&gt; capital &lt;/b&gt; while thousands of others marched across the country in &lt;b&gt; protest &lt;/b&gt; of government reforms aimed at cutting a $34 billion foreign debt, fourth-largest in Latin America. The march in Caracas was interrupted when a group of adolescents overturned garbage cans and shouted insults at police. About 20 of the youths began breaking windows in Simon Bolivar Center, a complex on Plaza Caracas, where the march was to end. Police rushed in firing tear gas and shotgun blasts in the air. Three &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; injured &lt;/b&gt; in the brief confrontation, including Rafael Calma, a photographer for a Caracas newspaper, hit by a bottle thrown by a bystander in the crowd, said police. Police did not say how the other two &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were hurt. ``It was the same group of troublemakers. A small group. We acted responsibly,\\'\\' said metropolitan &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; sheriff L.B. Gomez, standing his ground as &lt;b&gt; protesters &lt;/b&gt; chanted, ``Police off our streets! The &lt;b&gt; streets &lt;/b&gt; are ours!\\'\\' ``It\\'s the fault of the government\\'s economic package,\\'\\' said a leftist congressman, Ricardo Guttierez, participating in the march. The march was called by the 4 million-member Confederation of Workers, CTV, Venezuela\\'s largest umbrella labor group. The CTV has called on President Carlos Andres Perez to back off on austerity measures it says has hit poorer Venezuelans the hardest. Labor leaders have planned &lt;b&gt; protests &lt;/b&gt; this month after Perez\\' year-old Social Democratic government planned to cut subsidies on gasoline. The economy last year contracted by 8.1 percent and inflation rose to 80 percent under the effects of the austerity measures. Unemployment is about 11 percent, according to independent estimates, up from 8.7 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  york san city los angeles california john francisco today washington robert william calif houston michael louis paul cities park baltimore &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.777615553462059  \\n   101.

Federal prosecutors say Gerald M. Chernow, 49, and William M. Engelman, 52, cheated the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook by persuading maintenance engineer David Hilt to buy unneeded maintenance and roofing equipment that was marked up by up to 20 times its cost. Initially, Hilt was given merchandise, gift certificates and money orders, and later, his wife, Ellen, was put on the payroll of one of the Michigan companies, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Gleason said. Chernow and Engelman, both of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., entered innocent pleas before U.S. Magistrate David Cohen. Chernow and Engelman were freed on their own recognizance, but they must hand over their passports and will be required to pay $50,000 bond if they fail to show up to any court proceedings, Gleason said. The two businessmen had appeared in court without being arrested. The two are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and the use of interstate facilities in furtherance of private bribery. Both businessmen declined to comment on the case, as did defense attorney Julian Sweet of Lewiston. Also named as defendants in the 21-count indictment are Modern Research Corp. and Lincoln Technical Services Inc., both of Troy, Mich., and ABC Chemical Co. of Detroit. If Chernow and Engelman are convicted on all counts, they face up to 105 years in prison and fines totaling $5.25 million each, the prosecutor said. Modern Research and Lincoln Technical Service each face up to $10.5 million in fines, while ABC Chemical could face $6.5 million in fines. Philadelphia-based Scott Paper lost between $750,000 and $1 million in the scheme, the government says. &lt;/p&gt; 0.275014308112386  \\n   Thirteen Americans and six Canadians were honored as heroes &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.

Dissatisfaction in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has been fueled by political reforms proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Baltic residents say the changes will void their constitutional right to secede and give Moscow control over their &lt;b&gt; economy &lt;/b&gt; and other aspects of life. The Politburo, the Communist Party\\'s supreme body, promised Thursday to hold a discussion on expanding the rights of the 15 constituent Soviet republics. But the dispatching of three of its members to the Baltic region indicated the Kremlin wants to draw the line now on what sort of political changes can be contemplated. The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet parliament is to meet in special session in Moscow on Nov. 29 to approve Gorbachev\\'s blueprint for political change, which also increases the powers of the presidential post and creates a new national legislature. Viktor M. Chebrikov, the former KGB chief who now heads a party Central Committee commission on legal and judicial reform, opposed demands for local &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; independence in comments to workers at a plastics factory in Tallinn, Estonia, according to Tarmu Tammerk, an Estonian journalist. ``He said very strong words against &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; independence. He said the whole of the Soviet &lt;b&gt; economy &lt;/b&gt; is so tightly linked that one cannot speak of independence for one of its parts,\\'\\' Tammerk, who works for the newspaper Homeland, said in a telephone interview. Chebrikov\\'s remarks were broadcast on state-run Estonian radio in an attempt to give them the widest possible exposure. ``His words sounded like a grim warning to people here,\\'\\' Tammerk said. ``Economic Independence\\'\\' has been the watchword of a widespread movement in Estonia called the Popular Front, which seeks greater control by Estonians over the affairs of their Switzerland-sized republic. Estonians say the fruits of their labor are siphoned off by Moscow to subsidize poorer regions of the country, including the giant Russian federation, the largest Soviet republic. Two of Chebrikov\\'s colleagues on the Politburo traveled to the other Baltic states, ideology chief Vadim M. Medvedev to Latvia and Nikolai N. Slyunkov, who is in charge of formulating the party\\'s social and &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; policy, to Lithuania. Their arrivals were reported by state-run media in the Baltic republics, journalists there said. Later, the evening television news &lt;b&gt; program &lt;/b&gt; Vremya broadcast brief reports on the visits. Tass, the official news agency, said Medvedev outlined limits to political activity in meetings with workers at two factories in Riga, the Latvian capital. Tass said Latvians agreed with Medvedev on the need ``to subordinate group ambitions to the interests of society as a whole in the conditions of perestroika.\\'\\' However, during his visit to the Norma factory in Tallinn, Chebrikov heard Estonians object to elements of Gorbachev\\'s political &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; plan, Vremya said. The westward-looking Baltic republics, independent states until the Soviet Union absorbed them in 1940, have become a proving ground for bold &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; reforms that are part of Gorbachev\\'s drive for ``perestroika\\'\\' or restructuring. Granting a greater degree of autonomy to the small &lt;b&gt; republics &lt;/b&gt; on the Soviet Union\\'s western edge is fraught with political risks, since many residents resent Moscow\\'s control and some openly say their ultimate desire is complete independence. The Estonian Popular Front and a similar organization in Latvia have condemned Gorbachev\\'s political &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; plan, which is embodied in proposed amendments to the 1977 Constitution. The Lithuanian Restructuring Movement is to meet Sunday in Vilnius, the republic\\'s capital, to consider the issue. Members of the three popular fronts are now gathering signatures on petitions asking that the amendments be dropped and rewritten, Algimontas Vaishnoras of the Lithuanian group said in a telephone interview. The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, has scheduled a meeting on the political &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; issue for Wednesday, and Lithuania\\'s legislature will meet the next day. The 12-man Politburo, in a report on its Thursday night meeting, said authorities will consider changing the draft constitutional changes in response to more than 80,000 suggestions and comments from citizens and organizations. Friday night the Central Committee announced it would hold a special plenary meeting in mid-1989 to review policies dealing with the country\\'s more than 100 ethnic groups. ``The task of perfecting relations among nationalities is acquiring special importance and urgency,\\'\\' a Central Committee statement said according to Tass. &lt;/p&gt; 0.40124004566598  \\n   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday night closed a national Communist Party &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; on his &lt;b&gt; program &lt;/b&gt; of ``perestroika,\\'\\' saying resolutions endorsed by the delegates lead the way to a ``democratic image of socialism.\\'\\' The four-day conference, the first held by the party since 1941, was unprecedented in the openness of criticism of past and present leaders. Gorbachev pointed out one key to the four-day &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; _ the attempt to overcome the party\\'s Stalinist legacy _ when he called for construction of a monument to the victims Josef Stalin. ``I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be constructed in Moscow,\\'\\' he said in his closing address. ``This would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire Soviet people.\\'\\' Gorbachev spoke after the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; of 5,000 party members adopted resolutions in what the Tass news agency called an ``unusually stormy and long\\'\\' debate. The meeting, which was called by Gorbachev to pass judgment on his 3-year-old policy of restructuring Soviet society, formally closed after his address. The Soviet &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; also engaged in a long critique of the work of former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, who appealed earlier in the day to the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; to absolve him of blame for criticizing the pace of Gorbachev\\'s reforms last fall. That criticism cost Yeltsin his job and his spot as a candidate member of the ruling Politburo. Summing up the work of the conference, Gorbachev said, ``Through democratization, &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; and changes in the political system we willmake perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our society, a new human and democratic image of socialism.\\'\\' He called for the policy-making Central Committee and other organs to urgently settle questions related to political reforms so they can begin to be implemented at a fall session of the Supreme Soviet. Referring to his proposals to restructure the government\\'s legislative branch and give the president new powers, Gorbachev said ``the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system.\\'\\' Tass said the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; adopted a package of six resolutions, saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations and Gorbachev\\'s policy of ``glasnost,\\'\\' or more openness, were particularly thorny. It did not say what the resolutions said. The Tass report said there were several votes on amendments, and that the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; rejected proposals by space scientist Roald Sagdeyev on elections to government councils. An amendment calling for the Communist Party newspaper Pravda to be taken out of the hands of the policy-making Central Committee received only 56 votes, it said. Gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference. ``One of the heroes of our &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; was glasnost because our &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,\\'\\' he said. He called on the Soviet media to ``publicize the real achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,\\'\\' and proclaimed that no one has a monopoly on the truth. In an apparent reference to the time of Stalin, he said ``the printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.\\'\\' In contrast, he said the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; had showed how the interparty debate must be carried out. Before the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; debate ended, however, the long-simmering feud between Yeltsin and Kremlin No. 2 &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; Yegor K. Ligachev broke into the open. Yeltsin was judged as being politically mistaken by the party, but he said Friday his only mistake was poor timing. Gorbachev said Yeltsin was chosen to run the Moscow party organization because of his experience and energy, but ultimately proved he could not handle the job. Ligachev, at whom much of Yeltsin\\'s criticism was leveled, took the floor Friday evening to oppose his return, saying Yeltsin committed many errors and still hadn\\'t learned his lesson. The 57-year-old Yeltsin, a leading reformer and former protege of Gorbachev, was fired from his Moscow job as head of the Moscow Communist Party after he attacked the slow pace of &lt;b&gt; reform &lt;/b&gt; during a speech in October to the Central Committee. The speech has not been published. Yeltsin was reassigned as first deputy of the state construction committee, a ministerial-level post. He was dropped from the Politburo in February but retained sufficient status in the party to be chosen a delegate. ``I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early, before the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution,\\'\\' Yeltsin said. It was a time when the party was trying to display unity and celebrate its successes. ``Taking to heart what happened, I ask the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; to change the decision of the plenum of the Central Committee,\\'\\' Yeltsin told the delegates. ``If you find it possible to do this, you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of Communists.\\'\\' Yeltsin took the floor to answer questions from many delegates about the circumstances of his ouster and about his demand that Ligachev resign. He had told Western reporters during the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow that Ligachev was the party official most responsible for holding back Gorbachev\\'s reforms. Ligachev said Yeltsin had ``not drawn the necessary conclusions from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades.\\'\\' Other delegates also criticized Yeltsin, charging that he had been tactless on a visit abroad and gave interviews to foreign new agencies just to boost his own prestige. Some rose to Yeltsin\\'s defense in an open debate. Earlier Friday, the nation\\'s top environmental official demanded punishment for planners responsible for pollution disasters, and a reformist publisher defended the new openness of the press. At other times during the conference, delegates have openly disagreed on the concrete results of Gorbachev\\'s drive for perestroika, which was launched after he took power in March 1985. &lt;/p&gt; 0.354439941714667  \\n   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has won another political victory, gaining Communist Party approval to restructure the Politburo that once ruled the country. The Politburo now promises to play second fiddle to the separate government structure he also leads. The vote by the 28th Communist Party Congress on Monday also marks a new effort to reduce the ethnic unrest that is tearing the Soviet Union apart by including party leaders from the 15 Soviet &lt;b&gt; republics &lt;/b&gt; on the Politburo, the party\\'s ruling inner circle. The new body will have up to 23 members, nearly twice the 12 voting members on the old body, and many if not most of the faces should be new. The expansion and restructuring will accelerate the process that Gorbachev began after he was elected to a strengthened presidency in March, transferring power to a newly created Presidential Council _ a development that has angered such hard-line Politburo members as Yegor K. Ligachev and could squeeze them out of their jobs. Unlike the Politburo, whose members are elected by the party, members of the Presidential Council are appointed and dismissed by the president, along the lines of a Western-style cabinet. The Politburo, which formerly met once every Thursday, has been meeting only once a month since March, and has been concentrating on Communist Party rather than government issues. Since most of the Politburo members will reside in their home republics, the Politburo will continue to meet relatively infrequently and will not exercise as tight control over national affairs as the body has traditionally done. The duties of the government council have not been fully defined. The 16-man body consists of six voting members of the Politburo, including the prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister, the KGB chief, and Gorbachev\\'s right-hand man, Alexander Yakovlev. Other members are the chief law enforcement official, a reform-minded economist, a crusading environmentalist and a workers\\' rights activist. Significantly, whereas nine of 12 men on the old Politburo were members of the ethnic Russian majority, the new Politburo will include a majority of non-Russians. And the Presidential Council contains five non-Russians. The new Politburo will include the heads of the party organizations in the 15 republics, most of whom are clamoring for greater control over political and &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; decisions affecting their regions. Shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist Party five years ago, Gorbachev sought to centralize his authority, but he has been driven to support greater regional autonomy by the independence drives of the three Baltic republics. Moreover, the largest Soviet republic, the Russian Federation, last month proclaimed its intent to seek greater control of its affairs under the leadership of its populist Communist president, Boris N. Yeltsin. Mostly recently, Gorbachev has embraced the idea of reconstituting the Soviet Union as a looser confederation of republics. The Politburo has had its ups and downs since it was created on the eve of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that swept the Communists to power. The first two Soviet leaders, Vladimir I. Lenin and Josef V. Stalin, exercised virtual one man rule, appointing aides and allies to the Politburo. Under Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled for 18 years until his death in 1982, the Politburo was a coalition that made all the key decisions. As Brezhnev and the other Politburo members weakened with age, the country lapsed into what Gorbachev has labeled the period of stagnation. The first Politburo consisted of seven Bolsheviks, among them Lenin, the founder of the Red Army Leon Trotsky, and the lesser-known Stalin. Following Lenin\\'s death in 1924, Stalin eliminated Trotsky and other rivals from the ruling body. By the height of his power in 1952, he had expanded the membership to 25 voting members, all loyal aides. It also included 11 non-voting members. Nikita S. Khrushchev, who rose to power after Stalin\\'s death in 1953, whittled the body to 15 voting and nine non-voting members. Although he instituted reforms, he tried to keep a tight personal grip on power, angering Politburo colleagues who tried unsuccessfully to oust him in 1957 and succeeded in 1964. Brezhnev, Khrushchev\\'s successor, used the Politburo to forge a coalition among Soviet interest groups, such as the armed forces, the KGB, other government ministries and major industrial sectors, who held most of the dozen slots. He also included seven heads of &lt;b&gt; republic &lt;/b&gt; parties as non-voting Politburo members, allowing them to run their regions in return for loyalty. Gorbachev and his allies argue that Brezhnev\\'s system led to widescale corruption and blocked the transformation of the country into a modern industrial society. &lt;/p&gt; 0.35324437702244  \\n   Lithuania on Saturday proposed that its parliament compromise with the Kremlin and impose a moratorium on its declaration of independence, officials said. The proposal from the republic\\'s Council of Ministers appeared to coincide with a compromise offered Tuesday by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the official news agency Tass said it ``could mark the beginning of the solution of all the so-called `Lithuanian problems.\\'\\'\\' Also Saturday, Soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a fertilizer plant in Lithuania, partly easing the 2-month-old blockade of fuel they imposed to pressure the Baltic &lt;b&gt; republic &lt;/b&gt; into renouncing its March 11 declaration of independence. The Lithuanian government suggested the declaration remain valid but its implementation be frozen while negotiations were under way with Moscow, said Algis Cekuolis, a consultant for the Baltic republic. However, Cekuolis said it was unclear whether the compromise would have enough support to be passed by the republic\\'s legislature, which will probably consider it Monday. ``It will be received in parliament by very strong opposition,\\'\\' he predicted. The Lithuanian government, under Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, is considered far more disposed to compromise with the Kremlin than the parliament, which is led by President Vytautas Landsbergis and dominated by members of the pro-independence Sajudis popular front. Gorbachev proposed compromises Tuesday in a meeting with the leaders of the three secessionist Baltic states. He told the national Supreme Soviet legislature earlier that day that ``if Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of independence, we may start to talk. That means suspend its implementation at least for the duration of the talks.\\'\\' Saturday\\'s proposal by the Lithuanian Council of Ministers suggested exactly that, government spokesmen said. ``Our act of independence would remain valid,\\'\\' said council spokesman Gentaras Jatkonis. ``But we are postponing the realization of it.\\'\\' Similar proposals have gone back and forth between the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius and Moscow in telegrams and informal talks ``like a ping-pong game\\'\\' for weeks but ``this is the first time it\\'s on an official level,\\'\\' Cekuolis said. A spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament, Aidas Palubinskas, said he was told on Saturday by a pipeline dispatcher that natural gas was again flowing from the Soviet Union to the Azotas fertilizer plant in the city of Jonova. ``The plant will be getting 3.5 million cubic meters daily,\\'\\' Palubinskas was told by dispatcher Alexander Mishikov. Restoration of the gas supply fulfilled a promise made to Mrs. Prunskiene on Wednesday by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov that 15 percent of the republic\\'s daily natural gas supply would be restored. Politburo member Yuri D. Maslyukov told a news &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; in Moscow on Friday that the restoration of fuel to the Lithuanian plant was a goodwill gesture from the Kremlin and a ``reiteration of the Soviet government\\'s interest in speeding negotiations.\\'\\' More than 26,000 people have lost their jobs because of the Kremlin\\'s blockade of all oil, most natural gas and some raw materials. Palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the Azotas plant would mean 1,600 employees could return to work by the end of this week. At the beachfront resort of Jurmala in Latvia, leaders of the popular fronts of Latvia and Estonia and the Sajudis movement of Lithuania opened a &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; to discuss the future of their movements under democratically elected governments. The delegates, 50 from each of the pro-independence movements, condemned the &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; sanctions against Lithuania and discussed ways of increasing cooperation among the Baltic states and with other Soviet republics, Tass reported. ``Nobody has a right to demand either abrogation or halting the acts of independence,\\'\\' Tass quoted delegates as saying. ``A retreat will harm the democratic movement.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.351544221361977  \\n   Thousands of people went on strike in the capital of Armenia, apparently unhappy over the Armenian leadership\\'s presentation of an ethnic dispute at the national Communist Party conference, a newspaper said Tuesday. The Soviet government daily Izvestia said the strike began Monday, one day after ``many thousands\\'\\' of people met in the Theater Square of Yerevan, the capital of the southern republic. Most flights in and out of Yerevan were canceled, it said. In a Tuesday edition, Izvestia said: ``Like yesterday a series of the city\\'s industrial concerns aren\\'t working, or are working with less than a full work force.\\'\\' It said food stores and industries, as well as restaurants and medical services had been working Monday. The newspaper said farm work was going on in Stepanakert, the largest city of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, but that many other industries and institutions there also were shut down. Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of a territorial dispute between Armenia and the neighboring &lt;b&gt; republic &lt;/b&gt; of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but the mountain enclave\\'s predominantly Armenian population has been agitating since February to be annexed to Armenia. Armenia supports the demand. Azerbaijan is against it. At least 32 people were killed in riots over annexation which broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, at the end of February. Izvestia said the thousands of people who gathered on the Yerevan city square Sunday listened to a television broadcast by delegates to the four-day party &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; in Moscow, which closed last Friday. Armenian party &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; Suren Arutyunyan said in remarks broadcast on Soviet TV during the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; that authorities could not normalize the situation in Armenia, where large demonstrations frequently have occurred in support of Nagorno-Karabakh\\'s demand. He proposed that the &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; take up unspecified amendments to the Soviet constitution. The disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan has sent the issue to national authorities, and the constitution specifies no way to solve the dispute. Delegates who spoke on television supported Arutyunyan\\'s call for restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd. But Izvestia said that after a ``stormy debate\\'\\' on the square, a committee was formed that called for a general strike after laying down a series of demands, including a quick, favorable resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The committee demanded that the Soviet Supreme Court take over the trials of those charged in the Sumgait violence and demanded full information about the alleged poisoning of workers at a factory in the town of Masis. Izvestia provided no more information about the Masis incident, except to say an investigation was under way. The party &lt;b&gt; conference &lt;/b&gt; called for greater attention to republics\\' calls for &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; autonomy, but said authorities would not tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic tensions. Besides Azerbaijan and Armenia, delegates from the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also brought up ethnic questions at the conference. About a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three Estonian political prisoners had gathered more than 6,000 signatures by Tuesday during a five-day demonstration in Tallinn, Estonia. ``We will continue the demonstration until they are freed or until the authorities give us an exact date for their release,\\'\\' Eve Parnaste said as she carried a poster at the protest outside the Estonian Supreme Court building. She said the three prisoners had been demanding publication of a secret 1939 pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that placed the Baltic &lt;b&gt; republics &lt;/b&gt; of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia under Moscow\\'s control. All three were arrested this year, charged with spreading anti-Soviet propaganda or slandering the Soviet state. Miss Parnaste\\'s poster said, ``KGB is an evil empire,\\'\\' using the initials for the Soviet secret police. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  national part support major past give issue policy recent plan change committee action include special important provide future position situation &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.295860340432342  \\n   Here is a text of President Bush\\'s news conference Thursday: President Bush: Well I have a brief statement and then I\\'ll be glad to take some questions. The United States is engaged in a collective effort involving the overwhelming majority of the member states of the United Nations to reverse the consequences of Iraqi aggression. And our goals, enshrined in five Security Council resolutions, are clear: the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of Kuwait\\'s legitimate government, the stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, and the protection of American citizens. What is at stake here is truly significant _ the dependability of America\\'s commitments to its friends and allies, the shape of the post-postwar world, opposition to aggression, the potential domination of the energy resources that are crucial to the entire world. This effort has been truly international from the very outset. Many other countries are contributing. At last count, 22 countries have either responded to a request from Saudi Arabia to help deter further aggression, or are contributing maritime forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 665. And still others are providing other forms of financial and material &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; to these defense efforts or to countries whose economies are affected adversely by sanctions or by higher oil prices. And still others are paying a heavy economic price at home for complying with the United Nations sanctions. It is &lt;b&gt; important &lt;/b&gt; that the considerable burden of the effort be shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free flow of oil. Indeed, anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in ensuring that all of us succeed. The United States has large interests in the balance and has undertaken commitments commensurate with them, and we\\'re more than willing to bear our fair share of the burden. This includes above all the thousands of men and women in our armed forces who are now in the Gulf, but we also expect others to bear their fair share. A number of countries already have announced their willingness to help those adversely affected economically by this endeavor. And it\\'s essential, though, that this be a concerted and coordinated one and that all affected countries participate. It is &lt;b&gt; important &lt;/b&gt; to get the priorities right and make sure that those most deserving of assistance receive it and that those most able to contribute do so. And for that reason, I directed an interagency effort to develop a strategy to accomplish this objective. The group\\'s report was presented at yesterday\\'s National Security Council meeting here, and this morning I approved an &lt;b&gt; action &lt;/b&gt; plan. And our approach calls for substantial economic assistance to those states _ in particular, I\\'d single out Turkey and Egypt, who are bearing a great &lt;b&gt; part &lt;/b&gt; of the burden of sanctions and higher oil prices. The &lt;b&gt; plan &lt;/b&gt; also targets additional countries, including Jordan, the countries of Eastern Europe and others for &lt;b&gt; special &lt;/b&gt; assistance. The United States will also seek burdensharing for &lt;b&gt; part &lt;/b&gt; of our own effort. At the same time, we will be asking other governments, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Federal Republic of Germany, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, free Kuwait, and others to join us in making available financial and, where appropriate, energy resources to countries that have been most affected by the current situation. To facilitate this undertaking, I\\'ve asked Secretary of State Jim Baker and the Secretary of the Treasury Nick Brady to lead high-level delegations to the Persian Gulf, Europe and Asia. And I\\'ll be getting directly in touch with the leaders of these countries before Secretaries Baker and Brady arrive to set forth, spell out our general objectives. Let me close by repeating what I said the other day in meeting with the congressional leaders. The basic pieces of our &lt;b&gt; policy &lt;/b&gt; are in place. The Iraqi regime stands in opposition to the entire world and to the interests of the Iraqi people. It is truly Iraq against the world. But I want to make this point clear, we have no argument with the people of Iraq. The sanctions are beginning to take hold. And in the meantime, we want to ensure that countries contributing to this unprecedented collective response do not suffer for doing so. And what I\\'ve announced today and what I expect will be implemented in the coming days should help create a context in which sanctions against Iraq can be sustained with the intended effect. Another area where there has been unprecedented international solidarity is OPEC\\'s willingness to take up the slack in oil production created by the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwait\\'s oil. In this connection, I met this morning with our energy advisers who are watching the oil production &lt;b&gt; situation &lt;/b&gt; very, very closely. And we are pleased with OPEC\\'s decision to help take up the slack in crude oil production. And although we are in what I would see as a transition period, the &lt;b&gt; situation &lt;/b&gt; appears manageable. At the present time, we don\\'t anticipate &lt;b&gt; major &lt;/b&gt; imbalances in the oil market. But we do have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve tested and available if it is truly needed. And our energy &lt;b&gt; policy &lt;/b&gt; is resulting in increased oil production and fuel switching to natural gas and to other fuels. I also repeat my previous request for Americans to conserve and for all parties to act responsibly. Right now, the situation, I would say, is relative stable, and I am very pleased by the coordination that has taken place with so many countries in maintaining adequate fuel levels.

The European Community and its member states have consistently followed developments in South Africa with the greatest attention and have given a favorable reception to the initiatives which have been to bring about the abolition of apartheid and the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. They have already expressed approval of the results of the talks between the government and the ANC (African National Congress), in particular those of the Pretoria meeting in August which opened the way to the negotiation of a new constitution. They deplore the phase of serious violence through which South Africa is passing, which may endanger these developments. They welcome, however, further indications serving to confirm that the process of &lt;b&gt; change &lt;/b&gt; already begun is going ahead in the direction advocated by the Strasbourg European Council. They have decided to continue to encourage this process. Against this background, the European Council has decided that as soon as legislative &lt;b&gt; action &lt;/b&gt; is taken by the African government to repeal the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, the Community and its member states will proceed to an easing of the set of measures adopted in 1986. As of now, so as to contribute to combating unemployment and improving the economic and social &lt;b&gt; situation &lt;/b&gt; in South Africa, and to encourage the movement under way aimed at the complete abolition of apartheid, the European Council has decided to lift the ban on new investments. At the same time, the Community and its member states, with the objective of sending a clear message of political &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; to the victims of apartheid, and intending to contribute to a new economic and social balance in South Africa, have agreed to strengthen the program of positive measures and to adapt it to the requirements of the new situation, including requirements related to the return and resettlement of the exiles. The Community and its member states hope in this way to be able to contribute to the speeding up of the process under way through sending to all the parties involved in negotiations a concrete sign of &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; for the establishment of a new South Africa, united, non-racial and democratic and capable of resuming the place which it deserves in the international community. &lt;/p&gt; 0.272641028930976  \\n   The Federal Communications Commission has decided to relax its rule on ownership of more than one radio station. The new rule would allow commonly owned stations to be as close as 25 miles apart, as long as they are in different markets. The rule would reduce by about half the distance required between two stations owned by the same person or company, and it would allow common ownership of stations in adjacent markets. The FCC said the new rule will enable more station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that result from common ownership of stations. The FCC also agreed to recommend that Congress require cable companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights to carry their signals. The commission is expected to extend that recommendation to cover local TV signals before it issues a final order in the matter. &lt;/p&gt; 0.272405528356638  \\n   ``It is a magnitude that no one in their wildest imagination or scientific predictions could have suggested.\\'\\' _ Yellowstone National Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo, discussing a complex of wildfires. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  building project center space built site museum heart build construction cost buildings hotel atlanta device approval artifacts projects tower jarvik &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.486027145015763  \\n   Thousands of relics left by a lost Indian tribe in the ruins of their famed cliff houses were methodically looted before the turn of the century. Now a band of ``reverse archaeologists\\'\\' wants to bring them home. Before Congress outlawed the practice in 1905, collecting baskets, pots, tools and other everyday household items from Anasazi Indian ruins was a thrilling romp through history for explorers hired by East Coast collectors. Like the swashbuckling treasure hunter in the ``Indiana Jones\\'\\' movies, they took the ancient ruins of a culture that vanished before Europeans reached the New World. Most of the loot eventually found its way into &lt;b&gt; museum &lt;/b&gt; display cases. Large collections are housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Museum of the American Indian in New York, among others. But a group of volunteer researchers is eager to bring them home to the Four Corners area of the Southwest where the Anasazi pioneered farming and &lt;b&gt; built &lt;/b&gt; dense communities hundreds of feet high in scenic cliffsides. Julia Johnson, the director of the volunteer Wetherill-Grand Gulch researchers, decried the looting at a recent symposium on the early Anasazis, known as the Basketmakers, in Blanding, Utah. The group wants to reverse the actions of 1890s explorers and return the &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; to museums as close to the ruins from which they were taken as possible. To help achieve that and to help scientists study the Anasazi, 5,000 pages of documents and 500 photographs have been compiled on the &lt;b&gt; museum &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; to trace their origins. Since many of the early-day explorers kept meticulous diaries, ``it\\'s possible in some cases to identify exactly which hole something came out of,\\'\\' said Fred Blackburn, a biologist who joined the ``reverse archaeologists.\\'\\' Blackburn, 40, and his colleagues crawl through Grand Gulch in Utah, about 100 miles west of Cortez, searching for signatures the explorers carved into cliff walls. By matching the individual &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; on display in Eastern museums with the diaries, Blackburn\\'s group can supply a research base for scientists studying the Basketmaker era of the Anasazi, he said. The ruins were virtually cleared out and their treasures carted off by the time Congress forbade the practice in 1905, Blackburn said. ``And the expeditions weren\\'t real researchers,\\'\\' said Blackburn, whose wife, Victoria Atkins, is an archaeologist. ``There\\'s so much we don\\'t know about the Basketmakers.\\'\\' The Basketmaker Anasazis lived in the area from about the time of Christ until the year 700, Blackburn said. They are believed to be the farming pioneers of the tribe that &lt;b&gt; built &lt;/b&gt; a thriving civiliation in the famous cliff houses of Mesa Verde National Park. Their Pueblo Anasazi descendants disappeared from the area, apparently driven by a long drought, in about 1300. ``We\\'re putting this together so researchers can go back and find out what the origins of these people were, their customs, where they came from and where they went,\\'\\' Blackburn said. He started with the diary of Charles Cary Graham, who with Charles McLoyd began excavating Grand Gulch in 1890. The pair met Richard Wetherill and Charlie Mason just as the latter two were riding out after discovering the landmark Balcony House at Mesa Verde. Wetherill, a nearby rancher and amateur archaeologist, hired Graham and McLoyd to bring &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; from Grand Gulch to the local historical society. The collection later ended up at the Field Museum in Chicago. As news of the rich ruins spread, other expeditions followed, explorers erasing clues to the mysterious Anasazi\\'s past in their diligence to gather prized artifacts. One likely &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; for any relics returned to the region would be the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores, a town north of Cortez. Initial efforts will try to arrange artifact loans, with the eventual goal of establishing permanent exhibits, volunteers said. Fund-raising is under way to pay for lobbying visits to museums that house large Anasazi collections. Blackburn, who specializes in studies of Bighorn sheep, says his strong ties to the Four Corners area prompted his ``reverse archaeology\\'\\' work. He\\'s especially fascinated with evidence of the Anasazis ability to co-exist with the sheep that used to roam the area in large numbers. The fledgling ``reverse archaeolgist\\'\\' movement _ looking for &lt;b&gt; artifacts &lt;/b&gt; in museums to bring them back to historic sites, rather than the other way around _could provide clues to true archaeologists enabling them to unravel the mystery surrounding the demise of the Anasazi, he said. ``Archaeology is really pretty new here in southwest Colorado,\\'\\' he said. ``And there hasn\\'t been much done on the Basketmakers. ``There are a lot of parallels between the Anasazi and what we have today. Overpopulation and drought were a major problem for them and many archaeologists think that\\'s what drove them out of here. Overpopulation and drought are big problems for us, too.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.469916214218051  \\n   A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and nondescript. Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; planned for downtown Atlanta. Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the 50-story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is a slender, post-modern &lt;b&gt; tower &lt;/b&gt; of stone with tall arched entryways and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high, eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern. Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words like ``gracious,\\'\\' ``truly wonderful,\\'\\' ``serene,\\'\\' ``imposing\\'\\' and ``glamorous\\'\\' to describe the tower. ``It certainly &lt;b&gt; projects &lt;/b&gt; a vibrance to the rest of the world,\\'\\' said Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development with the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ``It\\'s just beautiful. Everybody\\'s just staggered by it.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; tower &lt;/b&gt; is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of the city\\'s tallest buildings. Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going up in Atlanta, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper complex was altered to complement the rose-colored IBM tower. New York architect John Burgee, whose firm designed the IBM &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; with design consultant Philip Johnson, won\\'t take credit for transforming Atlanta\\'s skyline. But he said the city\\'s image, as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change. ``Atlanta has been looking for its identity,\\'\\' Burgee said in a telephone interview from his New York office. ``It\\'s an historical city (but) its architecture and image is not strictly historical. You think of Atlanta and you think of `Gone With The Wind.\\' Now, there is an attempt to come up with a visual image. ``We all know Peachtree Street, but you don\\'t think of its buildings,\\'\\' he said. ``Like in New York, the Empire State Building; Chicago, the Sears building; San Francisco, the TransAmerica building. Atlanta doesn\\'t have that. It\\'s moving toward that, very definitely.\\'\\' Burgee and Johnson also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown Atlanta. Another planned &lt;b&gt; project &lt;/b&gt; grouped in the ``Son of IBM\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section, a complex of three office &lt;b&gt; buildings &lt;/b&gt; and a &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; being developed by AT&amp;T and the Atlanta-based Landmarks Group. When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the excitement over the nearby IBM Tower, its architects, Thompson, Ventulett &amp; Stainback, redrew the plans to use rose glass above rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire. The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by Portman, whose imprint is already deeply felt in Atlanta, primarily through the Peachtree Center and the towering cylindrical Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. Portman\\'s new &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; is slated to begin &lt;b&gt; construction &lt;/b&gt; next year and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One Atlantic as the Southeast\\'s tallest building. Unveiling the design in May, Portman said it was ``respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern architecture.\\'\\' Dale Durfee, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech, said completion of the IBM &lt;b&gt; tower &lt;/b&gt; signaled the acceleration of a change in the look of the city that began a decade ago. ``Atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla,\\'\\' he said, ``with no development of architectural significance.\\'\\' Burgee echoed that appraisal, saying, ``It was pretty nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you (to Atlanta) blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you wouldn\\'t have a clue where you are.\\'\\' Durfee said that 10 years ago, Atlanta was groping to form an identity and had no demand for the type of &lt;b&gt; buildings &lt;/b&gt; now are going up. Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office buildings, Durfee said, and corporate sponsorship of &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; projects &lt;/b&gt; has changed the rules of skyscraper financing. Some say that all the &lt;b&gt; building &lt;/b&gt; activity simply makes good business sense. ``Sure, there\\'s competitive prestige. Good architecture is good business,\\'\\' said Truman Hartshorn, chairman of the geography department at Georgia State University and a specialist in urban affairs. A good-looking building, he said, ``is easier to sell to the financing people as well as the tenants.\\'\\' Hartshorn said he expects the new &lt;b&gt; projects &lt;/b&gt; in Atlanta will bring special recognition. ``I think it\\'s going to open some eyes,\\'\\' he said. ``We have prestige with our cultural buildings, but I don\\'t know that our office &lt;b&gt; buildings &lt;/b&gt; are that distinctive nationally. ``These aren\\'t just ultra post-modern. They\\'re classic. They\\'re different.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.438359862371807  \\n   The &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; of living in Fairfield County is among the highest in the country, but the &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; of dying has become pricey, too. To make matters worse, burial plots are running out. Most cemeteries, where single plots can &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; $1,000 and more, are likely to be filled within 10 or 15 years, according to funeral home and cemetery managers. ``Cemeteries are going to become a thing of the past,\\'\\' said William E. Magner Jr., who manages Willowbrook Cemetery in Westport. Harriet Steuber, president of a group that administers Union Cemetery of Norwalk, said that once &lt;b&gt; space &lt;/b&gt; runs out, ``I guess we\\'ll all have to be cremated and dumped in the sound,\\'\\' referring to Long Island Sound, the stretch of ocean off the Connecticut coast. ``I don\\'t like to think about it. It gives me the creeps,\\'\\' Steuber said. One solution may lie above ground. Mausoleums up to four stories high are becoming increasingly common in the region. Construction of one such facility by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport began this month at Darien\\'s St. John\\'s Cemetery. ``It\\'s one of the, shall we say, contemporary modes of burial to help meet the lack of space,\\'\\' said Monsignor Nicholas B. Grieco. The structures are often multistory units containing hallways lined with crypts. Each floor might contain up to 100 bodies. ``Think of it as a giant bookcase with slots,\\'\\' Magner said. But mausoleums are not cost-savers. They are generally more expensive than below-ground burial, Grieco said. Other cemetery managers say mausoleum interment is about twice the price of traditional burial. Sometimes it\\'s possible to economize. At St. John\\'s Cemetery in Norwalk, a two-grave plot can be used for four individuals _ one on top of another. The practice is allowed at the discretion of the cemetery, which charges $1,050 for the double plots. But the &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; of the grave &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; is only the start. Add to that payments to the cemetery for digging the grave and the price of a concrete vault, plus a foundation for a gravestone and it could &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; as much as $2,000. Cremation, which one local funeral director said now accounts for about 30 percent of his business, can save several hundred dollars at the funeral home and there would be no cemetery costs. Basic cremation and transporation services can &lt;b&gt; cost &lt;/b&gt; as little as $160. &lt;/p&gt; 0.431739320901043  \\n   One of the last persons to receive a Jarvik artifical &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; before federal &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; was withdrawn died after surgery to replace the pump with a donor organ. He spent 87 days on the device. Carl E. Bryant, 43, of Louisville, died Wednesday, eight hours after the transplant operation, said doctors at Louisville\\'s Jewish Hospital. ``We did everything we could for Carl Bryant,\\'\\' said Dr. Laman A. Gray Jr., who transplanted the heart. Physicians said the donor heart, which became available late Tuesday, met the criteria for transplantation. But the left ventricle, or main pumping chamber, failed to function once the &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; was inside Bryant. The Jarvik 7-70 assist &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; was implanted Dec. 22 at Humana Hospital-Audubon by Dr. William DeVries, who pioneered use of the artificial heart. ``The transplant surgery offered Carl\\'s only real chance for survival,\\'\\' DeVries said in a statement Wednesday. Bryant was the second-to-last person to receive a Jarvik pump in this country before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew its &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; Jan. 8, said Gary Cole, an executive vice president with Symbion Inc., the Arizona manufacturer of the pumps. The agency said its inspections uncovered ``serious deficiencies\\'\\' in the way Symbion was carrying out studies with the device. In February, the FDA said it would allow use of the &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; as a last resort, but only when all other available treatments had failed and when no other life-saving &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; could be used. The &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; was last implanted in the United States in Columbus, Ohio, on Dec. 31, Cole said Thursday. He said two Jarvik pumps have been implanted in other countries since the FDA withdrawal. Cole said 159 Jarviks have been implanted as bridges to transplants since 1985. He said the longest-surviving patient to use the Jarvik while awaiting a donor organ was a French woman. She lived 603 days on the device. Dr. Barney Clark, the first person implanted with a Jarvik heart, died in 1983 after 112 days on the device. He received a Jarvik-7, which was supposed to be a premanent replacement for his heart. Bryant had a massive &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; attack in July and underwent cardiac catheterization and angioplastic surgery in his left coronary artery. His wife, Cynthia, took him to the hospital Dec. 16 after he complained of chest pains. Three hours before he was to undergo triple bypass surgery, Bryant suffered a second massive &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; attack. DeVries implanted the Jarvik &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; during a six-hour procedure. ``I have no qualms about Carl being on the assist &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; at all,\\'\\' Cynthia Bryant said. ``It worked wonderfully and may further research to help someone else. And we had three good months together that we would not have had otherwise.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.428420640878955  \\n   Proponents of artificial hearts fear the Food and Drug Administration\\'s withdrawal of &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; for the Jarvik &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; could hurt research toward a totally implantable device, but most see it as a temporary setback. And they don\\'t believe the action will have a serious impact on &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; patients because other temporary heart-assist devices still are available as a bridge to a &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; transplant. ``It is a shame because the Jarvik, for its limitation, did make some positive contributions,\\'\\' said Dr. Antonio Gotto, chief of internal medical services at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and past president of the American Heart Association. ``I hope this will be only a temporary, not a permanent, setback toward the goal of achieving a totally implantable heart.\\'\\' The FDA informed Symbion Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., this week that it was withdrawing &lt;b&gt; approval &lt;/b&gt; for continued investigational uses of its artificial heart, both as a permanent replacement and a temporary bridge for patients awaiting a human &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; transplant. The Jarvik heart, named after its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik, gained household recognition after it was implanted in Barney Clark on Dec. 2, 1982. He lived 112 days, his new &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; tethered to a bulky external power system, before he succumbed to multiple organ failure. In revoking Symbion\\'s approval, the FDA said it had found ``serious deficiencies\\'\\' in manufacturing quality control, monitoring of research sites, servicing of equipment, training of personnel and reporting of adverse reactions to FDA. Dr. Donald Olsen, director of the University of Utah\\'s Institute for Biomedical Engineering, said he was ``surprised and disappointed\\'\\' by the FDA\\'s action and hoped it would not hurt future federal funding of artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; research in general, particularly for totally implantable devices. ``Our concern, of course, is that this particular publicity will not have a negative influence\\'\\' on artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; development in general, said Olsen. ``But I would like to make sure (people know) that the artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; did not fail; it was a failure on the part of Symbion to meet the requirements of the FDA\\'\\' for improving the device. Gerson Rosenberg, a biomedical engineer who leads Pennsylvania State University\\'s efforts to design an electric heart, said he did not think the decision to pull the Jarvik would hinder research. But others felt the decision could slow research in the field. ``By removing the Jarvik, you take the first and main artificial &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; player out of the ballgame,\\'\\' said Dr. Jacob Kolff, who heads Temple University\\'s efforts to develop the temporary ``Philadelphia Heart.\\'\\' ``That leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think there may be a future for an artificial heart,\\'\\' said the surgeon, whose father, Dr. Willem Kolff, developed the first artificial kidney in 1943. Withdrawal of the permanent Jarvik &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; leaves only one other natural-heart replacement with FDA investigational approval, but that &lt;b&gt; device &lt;/b&gt; is used only as a temporary bridge and only at Hershey Medical Center of Penn State. Other companies have approvals for temporary implants and for left ventricular assist pumps that help the natural &lt;b&gt; heart &lt;/b&gt; work without replacement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  market stock index exchange trading points stocks rose jones shares million dow average issues volume wall york unchanged board big &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.866173563713779  \\n   The Dow Jones &lt;b&gt; average &lt;/b&gt; of 30 industrials closed down 13.29 &lt;b&gt; points &lt;/b&gt; to 2,583.56.

The delegation\\'s four members made no statement upon arriving at the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut. However, a committee source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the four planned to maintain ``daily presence in Sidon this week, waiting for a contact concerning our two &lt;b&gt; kidnapped &lt;/b&gt; colleagues.\\'\\' The team was led by the Red Cross chief delegate in Lebanon, Michel Dufour, and the committee\\'s spokeswoman for the Middle East, Marjolaine Martin, who flew into Beirut from Geneva on Wednesday. ``We remain optimistic after our &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; here about the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of our two officials,\\'\\' Dufour said, without elaborating. The delegation is seeking the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of Red Cross orthopedic technicians Emanuel Christen, 33, and Elio Erriquez, 24. They were &lt;b&gt; kidnapped &lt;/b&gt; by unidentified gunmen in Sidon on Oct. 6. No group claims responsibility for their seizure. However, Lebanese and foreign security sources blame the Fatah-Revolutionary Council group of Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal. The group has denied involvement and urged the captors to &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; Christen and Erriquez. The Red Cross team &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; on Thursday with Mustafa Saad, who heads the Sunni Moslem independent Nasserite organization whose 1,000-strong Popular Liberation Army militia dominates Sidon. Saad renewed his appeal for the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of the two Red Cross workers, saying failure to free them ``will be considered a hostile act against us.\\'\\' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, as well as Palestinian and Lebanese groups, have appealed for the pair\\'s release.

U.N. officials said Georges Vassiliou, president of the Republic of Cyprus, and Rauf Denktash, president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, will visit New York for &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; Aug. 24. ``The leaders of the two sides in Cyprus have accepted my proposal for resumption of &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; to negotiate a settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem,\\'\\' Perez de Cuellar said in a brief news conference. He did not elaborate on his proposals for peace in Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkish troops invaded in 1974 and captured the northern third of the island. Turkish Cypriots, who comprise one-fifth of the island\\'s 650,000 people, have formed their own breakaway state, headed by Denktash, in the Turkish- controlled territory. Several rounds of &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; between Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders, under U.N. mediation, have failed to resolve disputes over the form of a federation and withdrawal of about 29,000 Turkish troops. &lt;/p&gt; 0.341912830507224  \\n   Thousands of Iranians gathered at the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\\'s tomb Thursday, the 11th anniversary of his return from exile, and his son preached continued hostility to America, Tehran &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; said. On the first anniversary since the revolutionary patriarch\\'s death June 3, Ahmad Khomeini said his father, known as the Imam, constantly defied ``global arrogance,\\'\\' an Iranian phrase for United States and its allies. ``We must always remain on the Imam\\'s path,\\'\\' he said at a ceremony beginning a 10-day celebration of the Islamic revolution. Ahmad Khomeini said his father warned that, ``if we show the slightest bit of complacency, America will deliver its final blow against us. You, the people, must prepare for struggle against America.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; the younger Khomeini, a leading radical, praised his father\\'s successor as spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for ``treading the same path as the Imam.\\'\\' His exhortation for no compromise with the United States was seen as a warning to President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatist faction in Iran. Rafsanjani, who attended the ceremony Khomeini\\'s golden-domed tomb in the Behesht Zahra cemetery, seeks better relations with the West in order to obtain help in recovering from eight years of war with Iraq. The first part of Rafsanjani\\'s 5-year development plan, calling for up to $20 billion in foreign investment, got Parliament\\'s approval Wednesday over opposition from radicals who want state control and no foreign involvement. Tehran television showed throngs at the cemetery chanting ``Death to America!\\'\\' and ``Death to Israel!\\'\\' Iranian officials paid their respects at the tomb and promised to safeguard Khomeini\\'s ideological legacy, the &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; said. ``At a time when the government was in the hands of the enemy, the Imam\\'s coming from a safe place to the center of the danger was an act rooted in the immense power of the Lord,\\'\\' Rafsanjani said at the graveside, the &lt;b&gt; radio &lt;/b&gt; reported. Khomeini returned from 14 years of exile Feb. 1, 1979, after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced to flee. Ten days later, the government he left behind collapsed and Khomeini proclaimed the Islamic republic, Rafsanjani said: ``The Iranian people have proved that if a nation is resolute in its stand, and if it has courage and spirit, it cannot be defeated.\\'\\' He said recent changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere were ``a small example of what the people of Iran achieved 11 years ago, and these popular rebellions are the legacy of the people of Iran.\\'\\' Khamenei, the nation\\'s spiritual leader, told another gathering in Tehran: ``The future belongs to Islam, the Moslems and the freedom-loving nations of the world,\\'\\' the television reported. ``In the confrontation with the organizations of the satanic powers (the West), it will be Islam which triumphs.\\'\\' Despite the fiery rhetoric, this year\\'s anniversary of the revolution differs from past observances. It reflects the more more relaxed character of Rafsanjani\\'s government, formed in August, and an easing of Islamic rigidity. While Khomeini was alive, the anniversary was a time of rallies to show support for him, and of reruns on state television of bloody clashes between revolutionary zealots and the shah\\'s forces. On Thursday, television showed film of Khomeini arriving in Tehran in 1979 on a chartered Air France jet, but comedy and children\\'s shows dominated the morning programming. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said music would be part of the celebrations this year for the first time. Khomeini felt good Moslems should shun music. &lt;/p&gt; 0.329791664560139  \\n   An Iranian official said both presidential candidates have asked Iran for help securing the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; in Lebanon. Hussein Sheikholeslam, a deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, spoke at a news conference late Thursday in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, where he stopped en route to Kenya. He said Republican candidate George Bush and Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis made contact with Iran through third parties, including governments and individuals. Bush has denied this, and officials in Washington insist the United States has no direct or indirect contacts with the Iranians. Sheikholeslam said the identity of the intermediaries is ``a touchy question\\'\\' and that he did not want to get involved ``in the election games of the United States.\\'\\' But he said the contacts were not at the level of those conducted in 1986 that led to the Irangate scandal, in which arms were secretly sold to Iran. He did not elaborate. Sheikholeslam stressed that normalizing relations with the United States should be separated from the issue of the &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; in Lebanon. Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem militants are believed to hold most of the 14 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Nine of the captives are American. The longest &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was &lt;b&gt; kidnapped &lt;/b&gt; March 16, 1985. Sheikholeslam said Iran also was concerned about four Iranians who have been missing in Lebanon for six years. He said that while Iran was appealing for the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of its nationals, it was not necessarily linking their fate to that of the 14 Westerners. Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who lives in exile in Paris, said recently that Richard Lawless, a former U.S. official, negotiated with Iranian government representatives on behalf of Bush for the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of the American hostages. In Washington on Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied again that the U.S. government was negotiating with Iran. Fitzwater took issue with a report Friday in The Nation, a Jerusalem weekly, that &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; on the &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; but recessed because of news leaks. ``No one is authorized to talk for the (U.S.) government,\\'\\' he said. ``As we have said before, there are all kinds of people around the world freelancing on this situation.\\'\\' Fitzwater also predicted more such stories, although he did not say why. ``Suffice it to say, we find them (the news reports) mostly detrimental,\\'\\' he said. ``What they do is build up people\\'s expectations when they are not warranted.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.322289821428602  \\n   The United States and Iran have signed a $105 million settlement of some 3,000 financial claims, bringing the two countries one step closer to re-establishing economic relations, a U.S. official said today. The settlement deals primarily with so-called ``Small Claims\\'\\' for under $250,000 that stem from the 1979 Islamic revolution, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. It clears the way for the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal to deal with about $16 billion in major claims, whose resolution in turn could open the way to normalizing economic ties between the two nations, the official said. The settlement accord was signed late Sunday night or early this morning by Timothy Ramish, U.S. agent to the tribunal, and Iranian Agent Ali Nobari, according to the American official at the tribunal. The most recent settlement &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; between U.S. and Iranian officials occurred shortly after the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of American &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; Frank Reed and Robert Polhill by pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon. But U.S. and Iranian representatives to the tribunal have repeatedly stated the &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; dealt only with financial arbitration and not with the six remaining Americans still in captivity in Lebanon. Last week a U.S. State Department official in Washington, who commented on condition of anonymity, said he could not predict whether resolving its financial disputes will result in the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of remaining &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; or was in any way related to the &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; of Polhill and Reed. The Small Claims package dealt primarily with Americans who left behind personal possessions or were owed salaries by Iranian companies when they fled Iran during the revolution. They were settled for a total of $50 million. The settlement also provided $55 million for repayment of a loan from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The tribunal was set up as part of the Algiers Accord of 1980, which resulted in freedom for the American &lt;b&gt; hostages &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; held &lt;/b&gt; by Iranian militants at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The tribunal has three Iranian, three American and three third-nation arbitrators. The biggest claim still before the tribunal, valued at up to $11 billion by Iran, is for military equipment which Iran ordered but did not receive as a result of the embargo imposed by the U.S. government. After the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979, Iran canceled contracts for $9 billion worth of weaponry, including four destroyers under construction that were later taken over by the U.S. Navy. Remaining major claims, totaling about $5 billion, were filed by American oil companies for property and operations expropiated by the Iranian government, as well as for broken contracts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  investigation keating regulators case lincoln deconcini office loan savings thrift meeting senators frank ethics annunzio federal april contractors cuomo staff &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.537365733743194  \\n   Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini wrote an aide in 1986 asking what ``we can do to bring heat\\'\\' on a &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; banking regulator who was opposed by &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; owner Charles H. Keating Jr., the Senate Ethics Committee was told today. The senator\\'s memo to his &lt;b&gt; staff &lt;/b&gt; aide, Laurie A. Sedlmayr, was written in December 1986, after Keating had made clear his opposition to top bank regulator Edwin Gray, who wanted Keating\\'s &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; to adhere to investment limits. Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett cited the memo in questioning Sedlmayr as the panel held its fifth day of hearings into allegations DeConcini and four other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; improperly intervened with &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on behalf of Keating, a financial contributor. Sedlmayr said she was aware Keating wanted Gray out of office. DeConcini wrote her a memo on Dec. 11, 1986, citing press accounts of potential financial and ethical problems facing Gray and asking, ``Anything we can do to bring heat?\\'\\' She said she responded five days later saying it was ``probably unnecessary\\'\\' for him to take action and suggesting the senator ``stay out of this.\\'\\' Sedlmayr, under questioning by Bennett, said Keating was more aggressive than many other businessmen she dealt with. ``I found him to be something of a zealot and I wasn\\'t comfortable with that,\\'\\' she said. ``I think the senator probably thought I was overstating the case,\\'\\' she said. Keating, who owned the now defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan, and his associates contributed $1.3 million to the senators\\' campaigns or favored causes. As the panel began its fifth day of hearings in three weeks, DeConcini, D-Ariz., was the only one of the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; under &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; who attended the session. The other four are Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Donald Riegle of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio. Sedlmayr was questioned about a memo she wrote to DeConcini in 1987 suggesting a possible deal with the government on behalf of Keating\\'s &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and loan. DeConcini denies he offered a deal or tried to negotiate for Keating in the April 2, 1987, meeting. Sedlmayr testified that DeConcini went to the April 2 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with three other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; and Gray despite being warned by an aide that the session was a ``political mistake.\\'\\' She testified that she was not concerned about the propriety of the meeting, but was concerned Gray ``would misrepresent it\\'\\' later. ``I told him I didn\\'t think it was a good idea and could later be misinterpreted by the press,\\'\\' she said. ``I thought ... it was a political mistake.\\'\\' Sedlmayr and other aides were not included in the meeting, but she said that when it ended, DeConcini ``said he was pretty disgusted.\\'\\' She said DeConcini recounted that Gray had said, ``I don\\'t know anything about Lincoln, I don\\'t have any information and you\\'ll have to meet with the &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; in San Francisco.\\'\\' Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, did not attend that meeting. However, he did attend a session on Lincoln a week later with the other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; and San Francisco-based &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulators. The question of whether DeConcini offered a deal on Keating\\'s behalf is considered crucial to the &lt;b&gt; ethics &lt;/b&gt; investigation. Bennett, told the panel ``there is overwhelming evidence\\'\\' DeConcini asked Gray to withdraw a regulation opposed by Keating in exchange for a promise by Lincoln to make more home loans. The regulation limited Lincoln\\'s ability to make risky investments in speculative real estate ventures. Sedlmayr\\'s memo to her boss detailed ``What American Continental wants from Gray for concessions,\\'\\' and ``What American Continental is willing to do.\\'\\' American Continental was Lincoln\\'s Phoenix-based parent company, controlled by Keating. A sworn statement by another Senate aide says that DeConcini took the Sedlmayr memo with him to the April 2 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; and ``made verbal references to the subjects discussed in the memorandum.\\'\\' That statement was by Mary Jane Veno, administrative assistant to Glenn. She said she was told of the memo\\'s use by Gene Karp, DeConcini\\'s administrative assistant. When the &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; was over, she said, McCain asked DeConcini to explain what he had been talking about and in response DeConcini gave McCain a copy of the memo. But Karp said Friday he did not know if DeConcini actually referred to the memo and could not recall what he told Veno. ``As I remember it now, Gray said at the very beginning he didn\\'t know anything about Lincoln and DeConcini never got into the subject matter of the &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; or anything about that,\\'\\' Karp said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Whether there was any specific reference made, I can\\'t answer. Only the principals that were there can answer it.\\'\\' Gray has said DeConcini offered a ``quid pro quo\\'\\' proposal and that Gray believed the &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; was improper. No aides attended the April 2 meeting, and Bennett said there is evidence DeConcini\\'s &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; instructed all to come alone. Lincoln was the object of a bank board examination at the time of the meeting. Bennett said the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; were there ``with varying degrees of intensity, to pressure the board to end promptly the Lincoln examination.\\'\\' Lincoln was seized by the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; government in April 1989 at a potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion to cover insured deposits. &lt;/p&gt; 0.526604334871864  \\n   A U.S. &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; regulator testified Friday that Sen. Dennis DeConcini broke the bounds of propriety - but four other &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; did not - when they intervened on behalf of &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; owner Charles H. Keating Jr. Regulator Michael Patriarca, addressing the Senate Ethics Committee, drew the line between the behavior of DeConcini, D-Ariz. and four colleagues: John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif. Patriarca said it was wrong for a senator to attempt to ``influence, to change the outcome\\'\\' of an examination that was highly critical of Keating\\'s Lincoln Savings and Loan. ``My personal view is Senator DeConcini did that,\\'\\' he said. ``It\\'s not clear to me that any of the others did.\\'\\' The regulator was referring to the senators\\' conduct at an April 9, 1987 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with four San Francisco-based &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; - including Patriarca - who were responsible for the Lincoln investigation. Patriarca also said he would fault the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; generally, because they ``appeared to have made up their minds in advance\\'\\' that Keating was right and the &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; were wrong in finding serious problems at Lincoln. Patriarca\\'s two days of testimony backed the assertion of his ex-boss, former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray, that DeConcini took the lead in trying to negotiate a deal on Keating\\'s behalf. DeConcini denied that he sought a waiver for Lincoln of a rule prohibiting risky investments, in return for the &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; establishing a home mortgage &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; program. Patriarca was questioned by Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., one of six Ethics Committee members who will judge whether the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; improperly intervened for Keating. Keating and associates donated $1.3 million to the campaigns and political causes of the five senators. The committee has held nine days of hearings in an effort to determine whether the money influenced the intervention. The hearing adjourned until Monday after a former member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board testified he received calls from Cranston and DeConcini in April 1989 - immediately before the government takeover of Lincoln. In those calls, said Roger Martin, both &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; urged the board to approve a sale of Lincoln rather than its seizure. The requests were rejected. All the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; except Riegle met on Keating\\'s behalf with Gray on April 2, 1987 in DeConcini\\'s office. When the chief regulator said he lacked details of the Lincoln investigation, the four San Francisco-based &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; including Patriarca, were summoned to the April 9 meeting. That also was in DeConcini\\'s &lt;b&gt; office &lt;/b&gt; and this time Riegle joined the group. Rudman asked Patriarca whether he thought DeConcini was ``out of line\\'\\' in the April 9 meeting, when he sought the waiver for Lincoln. ``Yes I did, senator,\\'\\' the regulator responded. He said that the proper way to challenge the regulation was through the courts and Lincoln ``had a retainer with every significant law firm in the country\\'\\' to do so. Lincoln in fact did, shortly before the meetings with regulators, file a court suit challenging the rule. The suit was not successful. Patriarca said McCain showed the ``least prejudice\\'\\' toward &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; at the April 9 meeting; DeConcini and ``perhaps Sen. Glenn seemed to have their minds made up pretty substantially\\'\\' and Riegle was ``in the middle.\\'\\' Another member of the committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., asked if the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; were hostile at the meeting. ``I think it was hostile,\\'\\' Patriarca said. ``We were being dressed down.\\'\\' Helms then asked whether the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; expressed ``surprise or shock\\'\\' after the &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; informed them that serious problems - and possible criminality - were found at Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif. ``We didn\\'t seem to be getting through to the senators,\\'\\' the regulator said. ``They did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that we were trying to convey to them.\\'\\' On Thursday, Patriarca said the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; became less aggressive when &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; said they would make criminal referrals to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt; 0.430818882237569  \\n   The Senate Ethics Committee today opened politically-charged hearings into links between five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; and the owner of a failed &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; and the panel\\'s chairman bluntly told the lawmakers that many people believe ``you sold your office.\\'\\' Four of the so-called Keating Five looked on as Sen. Howell Heflin said, ``many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services were bought by Charles Keating, that you were bribed, that you sold your office, that you traded your honor and your good names for contributions and other benefits.\\'\\' Sens. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona each listened intently as Heflin spoke in his gravely Southern accent. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment, did not attend. All five deny any wrongdoing. Committee counsel Robert Bennett jostled a boxed puzzle before the committee members as he began his opening statement, saying he would provide them with a picture that later pieces of evidence would fill in. Bennett said Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle ``were important players\\'\\' in helping Keating in his ``all-out war\\'\\' with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulators. He said McCain and Glenn played lesser roles. Bennett said he did not contend it was improper for the &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; to hold meetings with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; regulators, but that it was up to the panel to decide whether their actions were improper. He said ``there can be no doubt\\'\\' that the intent of each of the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; was to help Keating when they met with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; in 1987. The five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; received a total of $1.3 million in campaign contributions or donations to their favored causes from Keating and his associates. All contacted &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on behalf of Keating at a time when the government was considering whether to seize the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine, Calif.-based &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; institution. The &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; later collapsed at an estimated cost to the taxpayers of $2 billion. Heflin told the five they would have the chance to say whether the donations ``influenced your actions in any way.\\'\\' He said lawmakers\\' activities legitimately include helping their constituents and overseeing government institutions and added that there is room for disagreement about conclusions in the case. Bennett said the evidence will be clear despite the refusal of Keating to answer questions during the Senate inquiry. Keating has been indicted in California on state securities fraud charges and is awaiting trial. ``One could ask the question, `If Mr. Keating were here, would you believe what he had to say anyway?\\'\\'\\' Bennett said. The five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; have become a symbol of the massive &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; industry collapse, and the outcome of the &lt;b&gt; ethics &lt;/b&gt; hearings could intensify the political ramifications of what so far has been a bipartisan scandal. In addition, the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; has highlighted a political system that gives lawmakers great latitude in contacting &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on behalf of constituents, at the same time they are dependent on campaign contributions to mount their political campaigns. The hearings stemmed from a complaint last year by the citizens group Common Cause. ``It\\'s not just the five &lt;b&gt; senators &lt;/b&gt; but the whole Senate whose integrity and credibility is on the line,\\'\\' said Fred Werthheimer, the organization\\'s leader. Heflin and others on the panel said the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; should not create a standard that bars members of Congress from intervening with &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; agencies on behalf of constituents or campaign contributors. ``A standard of conduct which would preclude members of Congress from intervening on behalf of individuals who happened to have contributed to or raised funds for their campaign is nonsensical and unworkable under existing law,\\'\\' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., another member of the committee, complained that panel has taken too long with the case. ``We should have already taken certain ... actions,\\'\\' he said. Heflin, D-Ala., defended the panel\\'s decision to hold the hearings against charges of partisanship. ``On all the votes taken by the committee ... not one was divided along partisan lines,\\'\\' he said. With documents stacked several inches high on a table covered with green felt, Heflin framed the issue that the &lt;b&gt; ethics &lt;/b&gt; panel will have to grapple with: ``The allegation in this case, that an individual used his wealth to get preferential treatment from government officials in the performance of their official duties, raises questions which are as old as history, and issues that bear on the balance of power among the branches of the &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; government. The committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or recommend a more serious punishment to the full Senate. Each senator has denied any connection between Keating\\'s money and their meetings with regulators. The basic issue is whether any violated Senate rules against exerting improper influence in return for compensation. All except Riegle attended an April 2, 1987, &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with Ed Gray, then the top &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; regulator. All five attended another &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; a week later with San Francisco-based bank examiners who revealed that potential criminal actions by Lincoln were involved. McCain\\'s top aide, Chris Koch, said McCain would make the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; that he ended his friendship with Keating on March 24, 1987, when Keating asked the senator to negotiate with &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; on his behalf. ``There\\'s no smoking gun on Don Riegle,\\'\\' the Michigan senator\\'s lawyer, Thomas Green, said before the hearing. He contended that Riegle\\'s &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; was unrelated to a fund-raising effort Keating directed for Riegle. DeConcini wrote a letter to about 5,000 supporters this week denying wrongdoing. ``You may hear derogatory statements about me and my office, but I can assure you that I have not betrayed my public trust, nor do I intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their dealings with our government,\\'\\' DeConcini said. Glenn has said in the past that he had no discussions on behalf of Lincoln after the 1987 &lt;b&gt; meeting &lt;/b&gt; when &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; said criminal charges were possible. Cranston\\'s spokesman, Murray Flander, said Cranston contends, ``I pocketed no money, I broke no law, I violated no Senate rule. Those are undisputed facts.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.352777354026735  \\n   Gov. Mario Cuomo today accused lawyers for a black teen-ager who says she was assaulted by six white men of ``making up conditions\\'\\' as part of their continuing refusal to have the young woman testify about the case. Meanwhile, the teen-ager\\'s aunt was quoted today as saying the girl hadn\\'t even talked about the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; with the lawyers representing her. Tawana Brawley, 16, missing for four days in November, was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces, with racial insults scrawled on her body. She said she was assaulted by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge. Miss Brawley, of Wappinger\\'s Falls north of New York City, and her family have refused to be questioned further on the advice of attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. of New York City, the lawyers who used a similar tactic to get a special prosecutor appointed in the Howard Beach manslaughter case. Cuomo had nothing good to say about those lawyers at an impromptu news conference today. ``They said they had reasons they could not cooperate. ... It\\'s clear now they don\\'t really,\\'\\' Cuomo said of the two lawyers. ``These conditions obviously don\\'t mean anything. They keep making up new conditions.\\'\\' Maddox and Mason were on the road this morning and not immediately available for comment on Cuomo\\'s statements or today\\'s report in the Middletown Times Herald Record newspaper that Miss Brawley hadn\\'t talked to the lawyers about the case. Cuomo said again today that he was willing to meet with Miss Brawley if it would help push the stalled &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; along. However, he said he would do so only if her lawyers approved and state Attorney General Robert Abrams, Cuomo\\'s special prosecutor in the case, said it would be helpful. In her interview with the Middletown newspaper, Juanita Brawley, who helped raise Tawana for eight years and who has spent time with her since her attack, said she is the only one who knows enough about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girl\\'s mother informed. ``I know a few things that no one else knows,\\'\\' she said in an interview at her home. She said of Maddox: ``He has not talked to Tawana. He does not need to talk to Tawana.\\'\\' She did not elaborate. On Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said the Brawley family would go to jail before testifying before a grand jury empaneled by Abrams. Sharpton, a minister from New York City who has said he is advising the family, said Cuomo is using ``macho politics\\'\\' in trying to compel Tawana\\'s testimony. On Wednesday, Cuomo had called on Abrams to ask a grand jury when it convenes Monday in Poughkeepsie to force Miss Brawley and her family to cooperate with investigators. ``Someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a young girl who has already been abused,\\'\\' Sharpton said of Cuomo. This morning, Cuomo said that whatever happened with the grand jury, he thought it was ``very unlikely\\'\\' that Tawana would be sent to jail even if she continued her refusal to cooperate with Abrams\\' investigation. On Thursday, Cuomo had told New York City radio station WLIB that he can\\'t understand why the Brawley family will not cooperate with authorities. ``I see no reason, no common-sense reason, no difficult-to-understand reason, why there is not cooperation,\\'\\' Cuomo said. ``At one point you have to ask yourself, why aren\\'t they cooperating with the prosecutors?\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.350349098513716  \\n   Highflying former &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; owner Donald Ray Dixon goes on trial Wednesday on charges he used depositors\\' money to finance lavish acquisitions, leaving taxpayers with a $1.3 billion &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; bailout. Dixon, 50, traveled the world for gourmet parties and acquired such trinkets as a 17th Century castle door, Baccarat crystal, Remington sculptures, a silver-studded saddle and a posh house in Solana Beach, Calif., just north of San Diego. The government says those luxuries, as well as payments to prostitutes and political campaigns, were financed from the vaults at Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association, which collapsed under the weight of Dixon\\'s excess in 1987 and was taken over by the government. A dozen other Vernon executives and associates have preceded Dixon in court; 10 have been convicted and a guilty verdict against two others was set aside because the jury discussed Dixon\\'s indictment. ``Perhaps when my day in court comes, if they\\'ll listen, they\\'ll find out what really happened and the blame can be properly assessed and properly assigned,\\'\\' Dixon said in July when he was arraigned on a 38-count indictment. The indictment charged him with conspiracy, misapplication of funds, making false statements and other crimes. Jury selection was to begin Wednesday in &lt;b&gt; federal &lt;/b&gt; court. Testimony is expected to begin Monday, and continue three to four weeks. If convicted on all counts, Dixon could be sentenced to up to 190 years in prison and fined as much as $9.5 million. An extra-large panel of 75 to 80 potential jurors was called because of publicity in the case, said Jean Hiller, court coordinator for U.S. District Judge Joe A. Fish. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jarvis of Dallas said 40 to 50 prosecution witnesses could testify. Included on that list is a convicted madam, who has confirmed that she supplied prostitutes for Vernon executives when they were in San Diego. Defense and prosecution attorneys declined to discuss the &lt;b&gt; case &lt;/b&gt; this week, citing a instructions from Fish. Until the recent notoriety given Neal Bush and Silverado Savings and Loan in Colorado or Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loan in California, Dixon and Vernon were at or near the top of the list of abuses cited in the industry. Dixon\\'s trial is an effort ``to bring to justice people who break the law, who use &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; associations as personal piggy banks, and who may have thought they could just walk away free and let the American taxpayer shoulder the cost of their greed,\\'\\' said Timothy Ryan, Office of Thrift Supervision director in Washington. Vernon had a luxury yacht and a fleet of five planes worth $6 million. The S&amp;L also paid the $22,000 tab for Dixon\\'s gastronomic tour of European restaurants, the government said. Dixon also is charged with illegal contributions to such politicians as former House Speaker Jim Wright and Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York who is now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Recipients of those funds did not know they came from illegal sources, prosecutors have said. When &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; closed Vernon, it was the largest &lt;b&gt; thrift &lt;/b&gt; bailout in history, and it remains among the most expensive. Most of the expensive acquisitions have been sold at auction since the government takeover. When &lt;b&gt; regulators &lt;/b&gt; closed Vernon, they renamed it Monfort Savings Association. In December 1988, Monfort was one of five insolvent thrifts combined to create First Gibraltar Bank, the largest &lt;b&gt; savings &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; loan &lt;/b&gt; in Texas. Vernon also has resulted in the stiffest sentence to date for an S&amp;L officer. Former Chairman Woody F. Lemons was sentenced to 30 years in prison earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  government party political opposition minister power leader elections country communist democratic national leaders parties movement groups council prime parliament constitution &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.477649757052216  \\n   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, head of Sweden\\'s caretaker Cabinet, is ready to lead a new &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; to replace the one which resigned last week, the &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; news agency TT reported Thursday. Earlier Thursday, the Social Democratic &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; informed Parliament Speaker Thage G. Peterson he was ready and able to present the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; to the legislature for approval. He was expected to get active support from the small Communist Party and passive support for the comeback by the middle-of-the-road Center Party. His previous &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; resigned on Feb. 15 when the Communists joined other &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; to defeat a bill for a two-year wage and price freeze. &lt;/p&gt; 0.473102375922439  \\n   The resignation of Bulgaria\\'s Socialist premier calmed raging anti-Communist sentiment, but it hasn\\'t done anything to solve the country\\'s deep economic and &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; crisis. Unrelenting pressure from the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; in Parliament and from strikes and street demonstrations forced Premier Andrei Lukanov and his &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; of former Communists to leave office on Thursday. Tens of thousands of people cheered in the streets of Sofia, an &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; stronghold. But Lukanov\\'s demise may prove a Pyrrhic victory. The main &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, the Union of Democratic Forces, must now prove it can help solve Bulgaria\\'s social and economic woes. ``Not even Jesus can fill Bulgarian stores,\\'\\' Lukanov said in a recent speech. A new coalition &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; probably will be announced next week. So far, nothing has been revealed about who will head it, whether it will be a collection of nonpolitical experts or draw in equal numbers on &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; and the still-powerful Socialists. The Union of Democratic Forces &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; had long criticized Lukanov for mismanagement, demanding that he step down. But it is questionable whether anybody could manage Bulgaria\\'s economy, which is so dependent on the collapsing Soviet bloc that it can only reflect the chaos of that disintegrating alliance. The &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; case against Lukanov always seemed to rest more on a desire to get the former Communists out of office. The opposition, and many of its Western supporters, seemed convinced it would win June elections. When the Socialists won, the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; formally accepted the result, but has seemed unable to live with it since. Street demonstrations got under way almost immediately, with students around the &lt;b&gt; country &lt;/b&gt; occupying universities to force the resignation of Socialist President Petar Mladenov. Mladenov bowed to the pressure in early July. Then it took three weeks of Byzantine &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; wrangling to get Zhelyu Zhelev, formerly the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; leader, appointed president. Lukanov, seen by observers as one of the few capable politicians in Bulgaria, was widely credited with persuading the Socialists to accept Zhelev. But the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; never came through with the tacitly implied second part of the deal: agreement to join the former Communists in Lukanov\\'s government. Backed by some Western diplomats, the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; apparently felt the Socialists were a spent &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; force bound to disintegrate. For his part, Lukanov refused to break with the Socialist Party, arguing that it stood for his social &lt;b&gt; democratic &lt;/b&gt; ideals. Lukanov eventually appointed an all-Socialist &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; but continued to battle for broad support, arguing this was vital to a vague but sweeping program of economic reform. Meanwhile, the economy and society slid into chaos. Electricity and food rationing began in Sofia and other cities in September. Stores have grown barer since. Power is now shut off two hours in every four in the capital. The worst outburst of violence came in late August, when an angry crowd invaded Socialist Party headquarters, burning and pillaging several offices. Last week, the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; took the decisive step of walking out of Parliament. A general strike by the main &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; union this week proved the final blow to the Socialist government. Although the &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; are said to have agreed on a transition &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; until new &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; are held in May, there is virtually no evidence of &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; unity. The Socialist Party draws on 100 years of tradition and is even older than the Soviet Communist movement, but remains severely split. The unwieldy &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; coalition of 16 &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; also is deeply divided, and boasts few figures of Lukanov\\'s caliber. On Friday, Sofia returned to its bitter reality. The shoppers glumly queuing for food know the new &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; is unlikely to make life much better. ``Even though I am stepping down, my economic and social program has no alternative,\\'\\' Lukanov told the Grand National Assembly in his farewell speech Friday. In his last weeks before resigning, Lukanov pushed for radical market-oriented reforms including an austerity budget that would jack up many state-controlled prices, close down unprofitable firms and introduce guarantees for foreign investments. If Bulgaria does not carry out radical reforms soon, it could find itself lagging far behind ``the European train\\'\\' of change, Lukanov told reporters. ``I\\'m afraid we have already missed the train,\\'\\' he added. --- EDITORS: Veselin Toshkov, AP correspondent in Sofia, has worked in posts in Bulgaria and abroad for 15 years. &lt;/p&gt; 0.431498096259634  \\n   Opposition &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; and Communist officials have tentatively set &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; for June, &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; television reported. ``According to unofficial information, the first round of (parliamentary) &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; should take place on June 8,\\'\\' Czechoslovak TV said Thursday. The report came as the Communists, other &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; Civic Forum met to review procedures for the &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; and the status of independent &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; parties. ``The draft &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; law is aimed at having the &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; for the Federal Assembly and both National Councils (parliament) first ... and in the second half of the year the &lt;b&gt; elections &lt;/b&gt; to the lower levels of representative bodies should take place,\\'\\' the television said. The 35O-member Czechoslovak Parliament is so far dominated by Communists. The discussions are expected to produce a solution to balancing its membership to reflect the current &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; situation. The talks are being attended by all five &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; existing before the revolution and the loosely organized &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, Civic Forum. About 20 new &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; have been created in Czechoslovakia the past two months, but none is represented at the current talks. The peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia led to the ouster of Communist &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; chief Milos Jakes and his hard-line colleagues in late November. Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel became president last month. &lt;/p&gt; 0.398983304235509  \\n   Efforts to reshape South Korea\\'s faction-ridden politics took a new turn today when President Roh Tae-woo\\'s governing &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; indicated it would dissolve itself to form a new ``grand\\'\\' conservative party. The move by the governing Democratic Justice Party, coupled with strenuous efforts by the two centrist &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; to merge, made the country\\'s &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; picture complex. ``We will actively respond to moves by the two &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; to merge,\\'\\' said the governing party\\'s secretary general, Park Jun-byung. Another Democratic Justice official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``It is possible that we would consider forming a new pan-national, centrist &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; representing all &lt;b&gt; democratic &lt;/b&gt; groups.\\'\\' If the new conservative &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; is formed, the governing &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; could be folded and its leader, Roh, would give up &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; membership and stay neutral, the same official said. Kim Young-sam, head of the No. 2 &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, said today that he would firm up plans next month to merge his Reunification Democratic Party with the No. 3 &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, the New Democratic Republican Party, led by former premier Kim Jong-pil. The two &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; earlier agreed in principle to merge their &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; possibly before local elections, scheduled in the first half of this year. ``It would not be a simple merger of two parties. The new &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; to be born would be a central force comprising all conservative groups,\\'\\' Kim Young-sam told reporters. Kim said his ultimate goal is to make the present four-party system into a bipartisan setup. If the two &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; merge, it would become the largest &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; group, replacing Kim Dae-jung\\'s Party for Peace and Democracy. The emergence of a centrist &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; would be welcome news for the governing party, which has been trying to isolate and discredit Kim Dae-jung\\'s liberal, pro-reform party. Kim Dae-jung, holding a news conference today, vehemently opposed the planned merger by his &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; rivals, contending an artificial restructuring of the present four-party system would only benefit Roh\\'s governing party. He said the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; camp would try to use the planned &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; merger to seek a conservative alliance, through which it would try to remain in &lt;b&gt; power &lt;/b&gt; beyond 1993, when Roh steps down at the end of a single five-year term. Many politicians believe the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; camp also favors a &lt;b&gt; political &lt;/b&gt; realignment that would enable it to hold onto &lt;b&gt; power &lt;/b&gt; as Japan\\'s governing Liberal Democratic Party does. If its plan to merge or seek alliance with &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; moderates is successful, the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; camp, assured of enough votes in the Assembly, would propose a constitutional amendemnt to change the present presidential system into a Cabinet setup headed by a &lt;b&gt; prime &lt;/b&gt; minister, they said. The governing party, with 127 seats in the Assembly, is currently far short of a two-third majority required for a constitutional amendment. South Korea\\'s politics are currently controlled by four main parties, neither of which has a controling majority in the 299-member National Assembly. The three main &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; parties &lt;/b&gt; have a combined majority in the single house but intense rivalry makes it difficult for them to cooperate. At his news conference, Kim Dae-jung said he would try to rally support from ``centrist &lt;b&gt; democratic &lt;/b&gt; forces\\'\\' to counter moves by his rivals to merge or seek alliance. However, his proposal lacked details. He also reiterated that his &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; would, if the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; endorses the plan, send delegates to &lt;b&gt; communist &lt;/b&gt; North Korea in the first half of this year to discuss &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; unification. If the dispatch of the &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; delegation is proven successful, Kim said he would visit Pyongyang with &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; approval to meet with North Korean &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; Kim Il Sung He said President Roh responded favorably when he raised the issue last week. But presidential and &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; officials said the &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; plan to send delegates to the north was premature. &lt;/p&gt; 0.395253676640631  \\n   Neil Kinnock, &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; of Britain\\'s &lt;b&gt; opposition &lt;/b&gt; Labor Party, will be challenged for the post by veteran leftist Tony Benn at the &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; conference in the fall, a Labor coalition said Wednesday. The Campaign Group, composed of about 40 leftist &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; lawmakers, said Kinnock\\'s deputy, moderate Roy Hattersley, will be challenged by leftist Eric Heffer. The announcement came after a meeting of the party\\'s &lt;b&gt; national &lt;/b&gt; executive committee. Kinnock, 46, and Hattersley are considered not as left wing as Benn and Heffer. Benn, 62, a former Cabinet minister, has accused Kinnock of watering down socialism after the party\\'s three defeats in nine years by the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Kinnock and Hattersley have worked for a united &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; and cracked down on militants in hopes of making a broader appeal to voters. They say a leadership contest will distract the &lt;b&gt; party &lt;/b&gt; from opposing the government. Kinnock and Hattersley denounced the challenge in a joint statement as ``futile and selfish\\'\\' and predicted ``massive defeat\\'\\' for Benn and Heffer. Benn told reporters: ``Democracy is about choice.\\'\\' Heffer said: ``The time has come for a crusade for socialism. The working people of this &lt;b&gt; country &lt;/b&gt; are getting a worse and worse deal.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  women men population training education program discrimination young programs minority language bureau society rights male included hispanic association female groups &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.402719350256743  \\n   The University of California at Berkeley, recently disrupted by student protests demanding more &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; teachers, has launched a new cultural studies program. Beginning with the freshman class of 1991, all undergraduates will be required to take one course on &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; culture. Each of the courses will focus on three &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; ethnic groups, said Ron Choy, assistant director of the new program. ``We\\'re creating a whole new &lt;b&gt; program &lt;/b&gt; from scratch,\\'\\' said Choy, assistant director of the new Center for the Teaching and Study of American Cultures. The center, planned for some time, opened Thursday. Choy said he expects students to welcome the courses, noting the ethnically diverse student body has a strong interest in race and &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; reations. Some students boycotted classes for two days last month to protest the lack of ethnic diversity among the faculty. Out of 1,636 full professors, only 24 percent are &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; or members of &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; groups. ``Frankly, this center was created partly to help get the faculty up to date,\\'\\' Choy said. ``We have to teach them, too.\\'\\' The 1989-90 student body is 45 percent white, 27 percent Asian, 13 percent Hispanic, 8 percent black, 1 percent American Indian and 6 percent undeclared, according to the school. The cultural studies center was created as part of a restructuring of Berkeley\\'s 1960s-era ethnic studies programs, Choy said. ``Most ethnics studies classes just talk about one group,\\'\\' he said. ``We want to create new classes that will deal with at least three &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; groups &lt;/b&gt; at one time in an integrated, comparative way.\\'\\' Such an overlapping picture of ethnic &lt;b&gt; groups &lt;/b&gt; will better mirror society, he said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.333286187168428  \\n   A federal judge apologized Thursday to an attorney he had scolded and threatened with jail when she insisted on using her maiden name and the courtesy title ``Ms.\\'\\' in court. ``I have always referred to married &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; by their married name. This is the way my generation was taught,\\'\\' said Senior U.S. District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum, 73. ``I recognize your right to be addressed in any manner in which you see fit, and I apologize for my comments and the resulting situation,\\'\\' the judge told Barbara Wolvovitz and three other attorneys involved in the trial of a race &lt;b&gt; discrimination &lt;/b&gt; suit against PPG Industries Inc. On July 8, Teitelbaum told Ms. Wolvovitz, whose husband is University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel: ``From here on, in this courtroom you will use Mrs. Lobel. That\\'s your name.\\'\\' The judge originally threatened her with jail when she resisted his instruction, and when her co-counsel, Jon Pushinsky, protested, Teitelbaum found him in contempt for ``officious intermeddling\\'\\' and gave him a suspended 30-day jail sentence. Ms. Wolvovitz, representing two black &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; suing PPG, moved Monday for a mistrial, which Teitelbaum rejected. When she again stated her preference, he said: ``What if I call you sweetie?\\'\\' The judge said he would settle for calling her ``counselor.\\'\\' He also vacated his contempt order for Pushinsky. The jury began deliberations Wednesday afternoon and was still out when the judge made his apology, which was officially entered into court records. Teitelbaum said that if Ms. Wolvovitz still wanted to press for a mistrial, he would grant it before the jury returned with a verdict. Teitelbaum said the parties would be ``stuck with that verdict\\'\\' if they declined his offer. The attorneys agreed to not seek a mistrial. Hours later, the jury decided against Ms. Wolvovitz\\'s clients, who had charged they were harassed at work because of their race. Ms. Wolvovitz, 36, who has practiced law for 10 years, and Pushinsky did not want to comment further after the judge\\'s apology, Pushinsky said Thursday. ``I think that he did what he had to do, and thank God he did it,\\'\\' said National Organization for Women President Molly Yard, a Pittsburgh resident who is familiar with Teitelbaum. ``I think it\\'s raised everybody\\'s consciousness and that\\'s fine.\\'\\' Tom Hollander, president of the Allegheny County Bar Association, said: ``I think it was big of him to apologize.\\'\\' JoAnn Dempler, Teitelbaum\\'s law clerk for eight years, said the judge ``is not sexist ... does not discriminate against woman ... does not demean women.\\'\\' ``He\\'s a tease,\\'\\' she said Thursday. ``His sense of humor is such that he likes to tease and joke and kid around, and if people do not know that, they could easily misconstrue what he\\'s doing or saying. ``Even in court, because we\\'re dealing with very serious matters, every once in a while to just sort of inject a little levity or reduce tension he will make a lighthearted remark, and people who know him realize he doesn\\'t mean to offend anyone,\\'\\' Mrs. Dempler said. Teitelbaum said he wasn\\'t teasing when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she would ``sleep in the county jail tonight\\'\\' if she refused to be addressed as Mrs. Lobel. ``I unfortunately lost my temper and the matter then got out of hand,\\'\\' he said. The judge also said he misstated Pennsylvania law when he told Ms. Wolvovitz she was legally required to use her husband\\'s last name unless she had court permission to do otherwise. ``I was wrong,\\'\\' Teitelbaum said. ``I made a mistake.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.332884933072444  \\n   In South Africa, feminism is viewed with suspicion as a foreign philosophy, even among many women. With racial &lt;b&gt; discrimination &lt;/b&gt; the overriding social issue, sexist practices go unchecked in both white and black communities.

The accolade and note of caution came Tuesday as the commission released a report entitled ``Ten Years in Prime Time: An Analysis of the Image of Women on Entertainment Television, 1979-1988,\\'\\' which examined the portrayal of &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; and compared the fictional panorama with the profile of real-life &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; during the decade. ``The 1980s mark a decade of progress for &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; on television. Their portrayals have become more diverse and, for the most part, more true-to-life,\\'\\' the report said. ``... The networks get a pat on the back,\\'\\' said the study\\'s author, Sally Streenland. The study said 60 percent of &lt;b&gt; female &lt;/b&gt; characters on the 25 top Nielsen rated shows in 1979 were portrayed as employed outside the home. By 1987, that figure had risen to 75 percent. By comparison, 1987 &lt;b&gt; population &lt;/b&gt; statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau show that 56 percent of all &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; were in the labor force. Streenland\\'s study also showed TV painting an unrealistically rosy picture of the types of jobs held by women. In 1979, more than 40 percent of television\\'s &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; were employed in clerical or service jobs. By 1987 only 23 percent of the &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; on TV had the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional careers. The real life situation is that 47 percent of working &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; have clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent work in professional or managerial jobs. The report also showed that black &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; have become more visible on TV. In 1979 there was only one black &lt;b&gt; female &lt;/b&gt; character on television, but by 1987, 22 percent of &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; characters were black. &lt;/p&gt; 0.312385004656423  \\n   Authorities are extending mandatory birth control to the far northwest\\'s ethnic minorities, but they will be allowed more children than majority Hans, an official report said Sunday. As of July 1, &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; couples in cities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be limited to two children, and those in rural areas will be permitted three, the Xinhua News Agency said. Minority ethnic &lt;b&gt; groups &lt;/b&gt; in Xinjiang total 8.6 million, or more than 61 percent of the population, the report said. Most Hans or ethnic Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of China\\'s 1 billion people, are limited to one child with the country struggling to feed and educate its spiraling population. However, the policy has been more relaxed toward China\\'s 56 ethnic &lt;b&gt; minority &lt;/b&gt; groups. The different standard toward minorities has been designed in part to win their loyalty to the Han-controlled government and allay their fears of being overwhelmed by ethnic Chinese. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  magazine newspaper paper newspapers editor publisher press news publication article note publishing hotel published women reporter advertising media editorial journal &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.683699096281642  \\n   The following are the most popular videocassettes as they appear in next week\\'s issue of Billboard magazine.

Photographer David Mecey had planned to meet with Providence College students for part of a Big East athletic conference layout scheduled for the April 1989 issue, Playboy spokeswoman Cindy Rakowitz said from New York. Mecey, who planned to stay in Providence from Wednesday through Friday, intended to interview and photograph &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; in various locations, including the Providence Marriott Inn where he had a reservation. The planned feature would include nude and semi-nude photos. The hotel\\'s name and number were listed on a Playboy leaflet and in a quarter-page advertisement to appear in today\\'s edition of The NewPaper, said Anne Trumbore, an employee at the weekly alternative newspaper. But Stephen McCarthy, the hotel\\'s resident manager, said that when officials realized Wednesday morning who Mecey was, they decided not to allow him to conduct business at the hotel. Mecey was told by &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; officials when he arrived Wednesday night that he could not conduct interviews on &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; property. ``If he wants to stay here, he can. He has rented a room and we are in the business of renting rooms,\\'\\' said general manager Rene Neidhart. ``But he did not have our authorization to use our name in any advertisements, and he cannot interview or photograph in the hotel.\\'\\' ``I\\'m not entirely taken aback, but I think that\\'s pretty drastic,\\'\\' said Rakowitz when informed of the Marriott\\'s decision. ``That\\'s sort of eliminating the rights of the individual to make a freedom of choice _ but a &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; is private property.\\'\\' Playboy also was banned from interviewing or staying at the Sheraton Tara in Braintree, Mass., when it interviews Boston College students in mid-November, said Jeff Cohen, Playboy\\'s managing photo editor. Some people who arrived at the Marriott looking for Mecey were escorted off &lt;b&gt; hotel &lt;/b&gt; property by security guards, said McCarthy. He said several people, both &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; and men, were removed from the lobby and floors. Playboy had decided against seeking the cooperation of administrators at any of the schools it will visit, deciding instead to advertise off-campus and in college newspapers. Playboy had hoped to run an ad in the Cowl, the student &lt;b&gt; newspaper &lt;/b&gt; at the 3,800-student college, but students and administrators decided against it, said a school spokesman, the Rev. John McGreevy. Officials at St. John\\'s University in New York, another Catholic school, decided earlier this month against running an &lt;b&gt; article &lt;/b&gt; about the Playboy feature in its student newspaper. ``I\\'m still confident that we will recruit our women,\\'\\' said Rakowitz, who said about 20 &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; were wanted for the feature. ``I\\'ve never come into a problem at a hotel. I think it\\'s sort of repressing.\\'\\' Other schools in the Big East Conference are Villanova University, in Villanova, Pa.; Washington\\'s Georgetown University; Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J.; the University of Connecticut; the University of Pittsburgh; and New York\\'s Syracuse University. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  india people indian state militants killed pakistan percent government kashmir sinhalese bc-spe--health miles moslem sikh tamil hindu million extremists united &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.564022268790565  \\n   Authorities moved to placate separatist Moslem &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; Monday by dissolving the legislative assembly of Jammu-Kashmir &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; and acknowledging that the 1987 polls in which it was elected might have been rigged. Also Monday, at least three &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and six injured in confrontations between security forces and Moslem protesters agitating for the secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-majority India. State Gov. Jagmohan said the Jammu-Kashmir assembly was being dissolved because it had ``lost its representative character.\\'\\' The move clears the way for new elections to the assembly, which could form the basis for making peace overtures to the militants. Many of the &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; say they were members of political parties earlier, and began agitating for an independent nation after what they claim was widespread rigging during the 1987 elections. ``It has been alleged that in 1987 some vested interests had rigged the election,\\'\\' Jagmohan said in a statement issued in Srinagar. In those elections, Farooq Abdullah was voted the chief minister, the top elected post in the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; administration, for a five-year term. Abdullah resigned from the post on Jan. 19 to protest the appointment of Jagmohan as governor of the state. Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, has said that quelling militant violence and holding new elections is the only way to defuse the separatist movement in the Moslem-majority state. Police reported at least three deaths Monday as Moslem crowds violated curfew orders in two towns in the valley. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and six injured when police opened fire to control a rioting mob in the town of Bijbehara, 30 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southeast of Srinagar. One person was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in the town of Shopian, 33 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; south of Srinagar, in another incident of police firing, they said. The deaths raise to at least 103 the number of &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since authorities launched a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20. Most of the victims have been protesters &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in police firing on curfew violators. The movement for secession of Kashmir from India is at least four decades old, but has flared in recent months. The &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; of Jammu-Kashmir, which includes the valley and the plains of Jammu to the south, is India\\'s only Moslem-majority state. India and Pakistan have both claimed Kashmir since the Indian subcontinent was divided along religious lines after gaining independence from Britain in 1947. The countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, and Pakistan occupies a slice of the valley. A U.N.-monitored cease-fire line divides the valley into Indian and Pakistani sectors. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the trouble in Kashmir. Islamabad denies the charge but says the Kashmri &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have a right to self-determination. About 64 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Jammu-Kashmir\\'s 6 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; population. Hindus make up 82 percent. &lt;/p&gt; 0.562268472012152  \\n   Three Sinhalese &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; and a soldier were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; torched buses on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence, police said today. Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in Colombo, the capital, and its surburbs. Police said &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were afraid to open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed to the Indian-brokered peace accord. A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the island\\'s south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike. Residents in the northern city of Vavuniya, about 125 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of Colombo, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also declared curfews in some areas in the island\\'s north and east until Sunday morning to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels. The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for five years for independence in the north and east of the island and by the Peoples Liberation Front, an extremist group from the island\\'s majority Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority, while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for independence. Three men were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by police in separate incidents in which Sinhalese &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; tried to attack &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; property, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said a Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; in Hambantota district in the south. In southern and central Sri Lanka, strongholds of the Sinhalese extremists, at least eight government-owned buses were set afire Thursday night and this morning, the police spokesman said. Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern Sri Lanka were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; bew up electrical transformers, he said. A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a firebomb as it pulled into Colombo, police said. Only a few government-owned or private buses were seen running. In the island\\'s north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called for a demonstration to protest the peace pact. On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; by Tamil rebels near Padaviya village, about 100 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of Colombo. The peace accord, signed by India and Sri Lanka on July 29, 1987, calls for the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; to grant limited autonomy to minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight for a separate Tamil nation. India agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, refused to accept the accord. India is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its own Tamil minority of 60 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; for the island conflict. Before the peace pact was signed, Sri Lanka regularly accused India of training and supplying the rebels. More than 8,000 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have been &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since the ethnic war began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Sri Lanka\\'s 16 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; and control the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; and the army. More than 400 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have been &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since the accord was signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists. Most of the victims have been &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; officials or members of the governing United National Party of President Junius R. Jayewardene, who signed the accord. &lt;/p&gt; 0.551098179376065  \\n   Eight bombs exploded today in the stronghold of Moslem &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; seeking independence for the Himalayan valley of Kashmir, authorities said. No one was injured. Authorities said the blasts, at two banks, a post office and other shops and businesses, occurred hours after fire swept through a shopping complex in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. No one claimed responsibilty for the explosions. Police said they believe the blaze was an accident since it occurred before dawn while a curfew was still in force. But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed the fire and the bombs on the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, the militant group leading the four-decade-old drive for the country\\'s only Moslem majority &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; to secede from predominantly Hindu India. India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but says the Kashmiri &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have a right to self-determination. At least 82 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have been &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since Jan. 20 in frequent street clashes between &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; and security forces in Srinagar and adjoining areas. Most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying curfew imposed by &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; forces to stem rising violence. The curfew was relaxed during the day from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m., except in the areas where the explosions occurred. Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir. Sixty-four &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the state\\'s 5 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Moslems, but Moslems make up 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; population nationwide. Kashmiri &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population, but the &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; now demand independence and the status of a neutral country. India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir. &lt;/p&gt; 0.532038328268148  \\n   Police today detained about 10,000 Hindu students on their way to a protest rally in the Kashmir Valley, where a day earlier 21 Moslems were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in a reported shootout. The caravan of buses and trucks that was stopped in Udhampur, 45 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; north of Jammu, was headed toward Srinagar, where the Hindu activists of the All India Students\\' Federation had planned to hoist Indian flags. The government, fearing violence, had appealed to the Hindu activists not to hold their procession to Srinagar, a Moslem stronghold in Kashmir, the northern sector of Jammu-Kashmir state. The students, based in Jammu in a predominantly Hindu sector, had ignored the official pleas. The Hindu students are opposed to a Moslem secessionist movement that is attempting to get independence for Jammu-Kashmir state, the only Indian &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; in which the majority of the population is Moslem. The students were arrested without resistance, one official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. They were expected to be released after a few hours without charges being pressed. In Srinagar, shops were closed and traffic stayed off the roads today in response to a general strike call given by Moslem militants. The strike was to protest the deaths of 21 Kashmiris Tuesday during a shoot-out with paramiltary troops near Srinagar. The &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; claimed all the victims, including 17 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; in a bus which exploded and caught fire, were militants. A &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; statement said the bus exploded when a stray bullet hit a pile of ammunition inside it. At least 1,175 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; have ben &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; in Kashmir since January, when the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; started a crackdown on the secessionists. About 64 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of Jammu-Kashmir\\'s 6 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Moslems. About 82 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of India\\'s 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; are Hindus while Moslems account for 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt; 0.521947258258326  \\n   A bomb hidden in a motor scooter exploded in a crowded vegetable market in Punjab &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; today, killing at least 31 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; and wounding 70 others as Hindus celebrated a religious holiday, police said. The bombing, which police blamed on Sikh separatists, raised to 39 the number &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; since Monday in the northern state. Sikhs campaigning for a separate nation have &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; more than 500 &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; so far this year in Punjab, a rich northern farming &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; where they hold a slight majority over Hindus. Soon after the blast in Batala, 25 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, Hindu mobs hurled stones at a police station 150 yards from the vegetable market, senior police superintendent S.K. Goel said. Goel was unsure whether any policemen were injured. The violence prompted officials to impose an indefinite curfew on the city, he said, adding that ``the situation is very tense.\\'\\' Most of those &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; were Hindus and the wounded included both Sikhs and Hindus, said Sanjeev Gupta, another senior police official. Thirty-two of those wounded were in serious condition. Goel said the bomb exploded during a march by about 100,000 Hindus celebrating the birth of Rama, a heroic warrior-king. Rama is extolled in Hindu lore as an incarnation of Vishnu, a member of the supreme Hindu trinity of gods. Witnesses, contacted by telephone, said portions of bodies were hurled across the market, which was covered with blood-soaked pieces of vegetables. ``Some &lt;b&gt; people &lt;/b&gt; were crying for help. Those who were lucky to survive ran away in panic. Many shops, scooters and one car were destroyed,\\'\\' said one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier today, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near Amritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, both Sikhs, senior police superintendent Anil Sharma said. Police blamed Sikh &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; for the blast near Taragarh, 17 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of Amritsar. Sikh Extremists initially targeted only Hindus in their campaign but now have also turned their guns on Sikhs who don\\'t support the separatist cause. On Monday night, Sikh &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; shot and &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; four members of a Sikh family in another part of Punjab, police said. At Salghowal, 95 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; southeast of Amritsar, five or six Sikh gunmen burst into the farmhouse of a Sikh constable Monday night, killing the policeman, his parents and a younger brother, senior police superintendent Baramjit Singh said. Police also blamed Sikh &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; for an attack on a bus Monday night in Uttar Pradesh state, which is separated from Punjab by Haryana state, news agencies reported. United News of India said one police guard was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and 11 passengers were wounded when five gunmen stopped the bus. But a second police guard &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; one of the gunmen and the others fled, according to United News. Press Trust of India said police recovered a Chinese assault rifle bearing the inscription ``Khalistan Commando Force.\\'\\' Khalistan, which means ``Land of the Pure,\\'\\' is the name Sikh &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; use for the independent Sikh nation they want to create in Punjab. The bus was halted while traveling between Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar, about 75 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; northeast of New Delhi and about 95 &lt;b&gt; miles &lt;/b&gt; from the Punjab-Haryana &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; line. Most attacks by Sikh &lt;b&gt; extremists &lt;/b&gt; have occurred in Punjab. Nationwide, Sikhs comprise only 2 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of India\\'s 880 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; people, while Hindus account for 82 percent. The &lt;b&gt; militants &lt;/b&gt; say members of the Sikh faith, which has roots in both Islam and Hinduism, are discriminated against politically and culturally by the Hindu majority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  south north korea korean war roh games communist seoul talks kim sports visit olympic remains peninsula hyundai korea\\'s delegation team &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.552162424874947  \\n   South Korea launched regular ferry service with China today for the first time since the Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; was divided in 1945. A 4,300-ton ferryboat carrying 130 people left the western port city of Inchon for Weihai on China\\'s Shandong peninsula, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. The boat will leave Inchon twice a week, Yonhap said. It will fly a Panamanian flag because the two countries have no diplomatic relations. South Korea has strengthened economic and non-political ties with China, a close ally of Communist North Korea. In recent months it has also increased ties with the Soviet Union and most of the formerly Communist nations in Eastern Europe. China intervened on North Korea\\'s side in the 1950-53 &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; between the Koreas. The two Koreas have never signed a peace treaty, and hundreds of thousands of troops guard their borders. &lt;/p&gt; 0.526919836958041  \\n   The two Koreas met on the soccer field at Olympic Stadium today before more than 80,000 South Koreans, who cheered for both teams and roared approval for unification. South Korea\\'s national &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; won 1-0, but the score was insignificant beside the diplomatic coup in having two enemy nations share a playing field for only the second time since World War II. The first time was two weeks ago in North Korea, when the northern &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; beat the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; 2-1. Today\\'s crowd was the largest to see a South Korean &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; event since the 1988 Olympic Games. At the end of the game, spectators rose for a standing ovation as the athletes jogged around the stadium holding hands and waving. The teams exchanged shirts and waved them in the air. ``Our wish is unification,\\'\\' blared a unification song over the loudspeakers. The game, called North-South Unification Soccer, is the high point of a five-day &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; by a 78-member North Korean &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; delegation, the first from the Communist &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; since the 1945 division of the peninsula. South Korean soccer players visited the &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; earlier this month. That &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; was only the second civilian exchange between the countries in more than four decades. The soccer &lt;b&gt; delegation &lt;/b&gt; returns to North Korea on Friday after rounds of sightseeing, dinners and &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; on future &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; exchanges. South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong Sung and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, agreed in principle to form a joint single &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; for the 1992 Olympic Games and other international &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; events at &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; in Pyongyang. They said further discussions would be held in Seoul. About 5,000 plainclothes police were positioned inside and outside the stadium. Spectators were searched twice and passed through metal detectors to get to their seats. Scalpers were asking $140 for tickets, 10 times the highest face value price. The teams of the rival Koreas entered the stadium side by side, holding hands and waving to thunderous applause. ``This is not purely &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; festival,\\'\\' Kim said before the match began. ``It should lead to a unification festival.\\'\\' ``I hope this soccer match will be a spring board for national unification,\\'\\' Chung. Thousands roared in approval and waved colorful pompons. Spectators had been asked not to bring national flags, decorative placards or other paraphernalia which would be identified only with South Korea. A drum and bugle corps played and a gigantic electric signboard flashed the pictures of the ministers. The North Korean &lt;b&gt; team &lt;/b&gt; threw half a dozen soccer balls signed with their signatures into the grandstand and screaming spectators raced to retrieve them. During the game, the South Korean crowd cheered wildly for plays by both teams. Radical students, who had said they would root for the North Korean visitors, were not visible. News reports said tickets were sold on an individual basis apparently to avoid large radical or dissident groups sitting together. The &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; exchange comes at a time when South Korea and North Korea are seeking to find ways to ease tensions and work together for unification. The prime ministers of both Koreas met for the second time last week in Pyongyang, the north\\'s capital, and have agreed to meet again in Seoul in December. A South Korean musicians\\' &lt;b&gt; delegation &lt;/b&gt; returns Wednesday from a 10-day &lt;b&gt; visit &lt;/b&gt; to the north. The Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; was divided into the Communist North and capitalist South in 1945 at the end of the World War II. The two nations fought a &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was never signed. The border between the Koreas &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; tightly sealed and is one of the most heavily fortified demarcations in the world with more than 1.5 million troops on either side. &lt;/p&gt; 0.486592565118984  \\n   Last month, Communist North Korea turned over what it said were the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of five U.S. servicemen killed in the Korean War. Now American officials say they\\'re not sure whose &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; they have. The &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; were handed over to to a U.S. congressional &lt;b&gt; delegation &lt;/b&gt; in an emotional Memorial Day ceremony in the truce village of Panmunjom in what was billed as the first return of U.S. Korean War dead since 1954. Only two of the five bodies were identified by name by the North Koreans, based on dogtags they said were found with them. They were U.S. Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah and Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, of Chester, Pa. But the United Nations Command said today that the bodies, which were sent to the Army\\'s Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu for identification, were not those of Saunders and Seaton. ``While North Korea has indicated name association for two of the five remains, dental and physical characteristics of the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; were compared with the dental and physical records of the those two individuals, with negative results,\\'\\' the command said. The command said its findings were preliminary, but said it did not appear that the other &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; returned were those of Saunders or Seaton either. ``Until the identification process is complete, we can\\'t even be sure they were the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of Americans,\\'\\' the command added. The soldiers\\' relatives have been told of the findings, the command said. The other three sets of &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; were not identified by North Korea, but it said at the time of the return that they were believed to be those of another Army servicemen and two U.S. Air Force members. All five were believed to have been prisoners of &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; who died in Hwanghae Pukto province, &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; of North Korea\\'s capital of Pyongyang. Saunders and Seaton had been listed as missing in February 1951, the Pentagon said. According to U.S. military, 8,172 U.S. soldiers remain unaccounted for from the war. The return of the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; was widely seen as a sign of healing and reconciliation after decades of emnity, an effort by North Korea to improve relations with the United States. The two countries do not have diplomatic ties. The United Nations Command says 33,629 U.S. soldiers were killed and 103,284 wounded in the war. More than 2 million Koreans were killed. The 16-nation command, led by an American general, was formed at the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War to help South Korea repel invaders from the North. There were large-scale returns of &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of U.S. &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; dead in 1953 and 1954. Then, after years of no returns, the North Koreans announced May 14 that they would turn over the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of the five. Ho Jong, North Korean\\'s deputy permanant representative at its U.N. mission, said at the time that the Communist government was prepared to discuss the return of more remains. He said the move was an ``eloquent illustration\\'\\' of North Korea\\'s wilingness to ``settle pending issues with the U.S. government in a good way.\\'\\' North Korea acknowledged for the first time in January 1988 that it was still holding the &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; of U.N. Command &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; dead. &lt;/p&gt; 0.439376559501793  \\n   Communist North Korea on Friday offered to open a small stretch of its border to promote unification with South Korea, but its capitalist rival dismissed the gesture as insignificant. The Communist overture came as the prime ministers of the two nations prepared to hold historic talks, perhaps as early as August. North Korea announced it would open the northern sector of Panmunjom, a border village, on Aug. 15, according to Naewoe Press, a semi-official South Korean news agency that specializes in Communist affairs. North Korea said the opening, about 800 yards long and 500 yards wide, was aimed at promoting unification of the Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; and urged South Korea to do the same, according to Naewoe. ``For successful progress of contact and visits between the &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; and the south, we will open the portion of our side ... and hope that the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; side will take a corresponding measure,\\'\\' the agency quoted the Communist government as saying. The opening, however, would not permit foreigners to travel inland, past the perimeter of Panmunjom, a truce village that straddles part of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas. The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a United Nations Command, comprising the United States and 15 other countries that fought with South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. No civilians may enter the area from either side without approval. South Korea\\'s Defense Ministry said it had not been officially notified of the north\\'s plans and would not comment on whether anyone would be allowed to cross the border. But a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity that North Korea\\'s move was ``insignificant\\'\\' because it affected only a small, restricted section of the heavily fortified border. Other officials said the move was aimed at dividing opinions in South Korea, where dissidents are pushing for free contacts with their Communist neighbors. The South Korean opposition welcomed the announcement. Dissidents asked Seoul to allow 300 people to meet with North Koreans at the border village Aug. 15, the day in 1945 that Korea was freed from Japanese colonial rule. But a spokesman for South Korea\\'s umbrella dissident group, Chonminyon, said the Seoul response had been negative. The South Korean government bans unauthorized border &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; with North Korea. After a five-month suspension, South Korean and North Korean officials have been meeting to discuss an accord that would outline terms for the first &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; between their prime ministers. On Tuesday, the Koreas agreed in principle to hold the prime ministers\\' meeting, possibly in August in Seoul. They agreed to adopt a formal accord July 26. Talks have been held sporadically between the two Koreas, but little progress had been made until recently. The border on both sides is heavily fortified and sealed, blocking exchanges of mail and transportation. North Korea is one of the last totalitarian Communist states, and sweeping changes in Eastern Europe and its socialist allies have made little impact. The two Koreas are still technically at war. No peace treaty has been signed since the three-year Korean War ended in 1953. &lt;/p&gt; 0.433794463538924  \\n   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today accused North Korea of trying to disrupt the Olympic Games and said the United States would beef up its military forces to stop any threat. ``Let me assure you that we will do all we can to help ensure the security of the 1988 Summer Olympics Games,\\'\\' he said. Communist North Korea continues to threaten peace on the divided Korean &lt;b&gt; peninsula &lt;/b&gt; by refusing to work with South Korea to defuse the tension, Carlucci said. ``It is most unfortunate that the &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; continues its trouble-making role and &lt;b&gt; remains &lt;/b&gt; unwilling to make the simple concessions necessary to bring about a reduction in tensions on the peninsula,\\'\\' he said. Carlucci gave the assurance to South Korean defense officials at the start of the 20th annual U.S.-South Korea security conference to discuss mutual defense. South Korea Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok also stressed the North Korean threat to the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; and said the Olympics was adding to the tension. ``With the danger of their scheme to disrupt the coming Olympics remaining undiminished, military tension between &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; north &lt;/b&gt; on the peninsla continues, thus posing a grave threat to the stability of Northeast Asia,\\'\\' he said. U.S. and South Korean delegates agreed during the &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; to build up their early warning systems to detect any possible North Korean military threat. Up to three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will help provide security for the Games, officials said. North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the demand, saying the Games are awarded to a single city. The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter opponents that have clashed repeatedly. The United States has about 42,000 U.S. troops based in the &lt;b&gt; south &lt;/b&gt; under a mutual defense pact. After meeting with Oh, Carlucci had lunch with President Roh Tae-woo and was awarded the Order of National Security. His scheduled visits later in the day with frontline American and South Korean troops were canceled due to bad weather, officials said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  spain hijackers crime spanish gunmen owen cain red saturday gotti hostages hijacking o\\'ferrell mafia suitcase plot italian libya barahona brigades &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.411058162177051  \\n   Police said they raided a Mafia summit Saturday and arrested five people meeting to draw up new territories for Naples\\' &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; families. The five were charged with criminal association of a Mafia type and with illegal possession of firearms. They are reputed leaders of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia. Authorities said the five met at the apartment of the boss of one Camorra gang and that the apartment had been under surveillance for months. The five were identified as Antonio Egizio, 35; his brother Umberto Egizio, 24; Vincenzo Romano, 28; Vincenzo de Michele, 36; and Salvatore Manna, 44. Police said Antonio Egizio recently sent a letter to President Francesco Cossiga complaining that he was a good person who was continously being persecuted, stopped and followed by the police. &lt;/p&gt; 0.387572594340656  \\n   Reputed mob boss John Gotti was described as ``God\\'s gift to the underworld\\'\\' in tapes secretly recorded by law enforcement agents and played Wednesday to jurors at his assault and conspiracy trial. Prosecutors say Gotti, 49, became boss of the Gambino &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; family, largest of New York\\'s five Mafia factions, in December 1985 after then-boss Paul Castellano was gunned down in front of a steak house. Transcripts of the tapes, which were released to the news media, show Gotti concerned about keeping underlings, including lifelong friends, in their place. At least once on the tapes, Gotti uses the term ``Cosa Nostra\\' when he is apparently telling an unidentified man that mob soldiers should not address him directly on business matters but should go through their ``capos,\\'\\' or captains. The tapes also indicate a relationship with the Westies, a vicious Irish-American gang that operates on Manhattan\\'s West Side. The Westies are a key factor in Gotti\\'s trial with associate Anthony Guerrieri, 60, on charges of assault and conspiracy in the 1986 revenge shooting of John F. O\\'Connor, former vice president of a Carpenters Union local. Gotti is accused of commissioning the Westies to shoot and wound O\\'Connor because the union leader had thugs trash a restaurant owned by Gotti associate Philip ``Philly\\'\\' Modica. The transcripts show at least one mention by Gotti of the restaurant and several comments on the Westies. At one point Gotti says ``...they\\'re doing something for me them Irish guys...,\\'\\' but does not say what. At another point, Gotti refers to James Coonan as ``my friend\\'\\' who is ``the leader of the West Side gang, Irish guys.\\'\\' He also says, ``He\\'s on the payroll, and he gets it legitimately ...\\'\\' The tapes were introduced by Edward Wright, an investigator with the state\\'s Organized Crime Task Force. Wright said the alleged mobsters, suspecting they might be under surveillance, turned on hair dryers, flushed toilets, whispered and used other means to try to make conversations inaudible. The tapes were made from listening devices placed in Gotti\\'s hangout in the borough of Qeens and monitored by police between June 19, 1985, and Feb. 26, 1986. More than 1,000 cassettes were recorded, prosecutors say. One 1986 tape shows Gotti in a telephone conversation quoting someone who praised him: ``When they say God\\'s gift to the underworld, you are it. ``He speaks with his heart,\\'\\' Gotti said on the telephone. ``He means it. I tell ya something, I love the guy.\\'\\' On another tape, Gotti expressed annoyance with lifelong friend Angelo Ruggiero for his familiarity during business hours. ``I told Ange, `You gotta forget them liberties you take. Take `em when we\\'re alone,\\'\\'\\' Gotti said. Gotti apparently had just made Ruggiero a ``caporegime,\\'\\' or crew captain, according to the tape transcripts, and was not satisfied that his friend was acting like a leader. Ruggiero, a defendant in the O\\'Connor case with Gotti, died of natural causes last month. &lt;/p&gt; 0.317650341569912  \\n   The Town Council has resigned to protest reports its members are suspected of ties with the Mafia. The councilmen followed the lead of the mayor, Paolo Scarna. He quit after a nephew was suspected of killing a judge last month who was ruling on whether purported Mafia members should be kept under house arrest, news reports said Friday. The resignations of the 32 council members came amid reports that police were investigating local politicians for possible links with organized crime. The town of 25,000 people, one of the poorest in Sicily, is in the province of Agrigento, an area that over the last few years has seen many slayings linked to the mob, including the murder of two anti-Mafia magistrates. Italy\\'s top anti-Mafia fighter, Magistrate Domenico Sica, has looked into possible Mafia activity in the town. In Palermo, meanwhile, officials announced on Friday that police have arrested 12 people suspected of drug-trafficking and money-laundering. The arrests came in a nationwide sweep that began Thursday night and involved searches of houses and business offices in Palermo, Rome, Milan and the northern cities of Como and Asti, police officials said. Those arrested were held for investigation of suspected organized &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; ties that involved drug dealing and money laundering. Investigators said they were aided by the testimony of a former mobster-turned-informer and by the discovery in January of a ledger that police say contained entries on Mafia financial transactions. The ledger was found in the house of a fugitive suspected Mafia boss. The drugs appeared to have moved directly from Turkey to Sicily and the drug profits appeared to have been laundered through Swiss banks, the Italian news agency AGI reported. &lt;/p&gt; 0.313418487504187  \\n   Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, a close friend and adviser of Premier Ciriaco De Mita, was shot to death Saturday at his home in northern Italy. An anonymous caller said Red Brigades terrorists were responsible. Investigators told Italian news agencies the body of the 51-year-old Christian Democrat senator was found on a couch in his living room at Forli, 40 miles southeast of Bologna. They said he was shot in the back of the neck. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said an anonymous telephone caller to the Bologna office of the Rome newspaper La Repubblica asserted responsibility on behalf of the Red Brigades. The spokesman quoted the caller as saying, ``We have killed Senator Ruffilli, attacking at the heart of the state. Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party.\\'\\' President Francesco Cossiga said: ``Our institutions and all the forces that are alive in the country will know how to act with firmness for the defense of liberty and of right. ``The assassination of Sen. Roberto Ruffilli is a horrendous &lt;b&gt; crime &lt;/b&gt; against the most sacred of human values _ life. It is an abominable attack on the parliamentary and representative institutions which are the fulcrum of our democratic state.\\'\\' Maurizio Laudi, a magistrate who has investigated the terrorist group, was quoted by the news agency AGI as saying the Red Brigades for the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party is the most dangerous and active group in what remains of the Red Brigades. He said it also is the most difficult to penetrate. AGI said Ruffilli had received threatening phone calls in recent days. He led the Christian Democrat committee on problems of the state and was working with the premier on institutional reform. Ruffilli also was on the parliamentary commission that investigated the P-2 Masonic Lodge scandal. Premier De Mita convened a special meeting Saturday night of Interior Minister Antonio Gava and the chiefs of the Italy\\'s police forces. ``The criminal warning of the terrorists could not have been any clearer,\\'\\' he said. ``It has the same clarity with which 10 years ago through the person of Aldo Moro they aimed at his political program.\\'\\' Red Brigades terrorists kidnapped and killed Moro, a former premier, in 1978. According to the news agency ANSA, investigators at Ruffilli\\'s home found the door open and no signs of forced entry. State-run RAI television said the assassins fled on foot after the shooting at about 1 p.m. In a dispatch quoting government sources it did not identify, AGI said the car bombing that killed five people and wounded 17 at a Naples club for U.S. military personnel Thursday night may have inspired terrorists to kill Rufilli. An American servicewoman and four Italians were killed in the blast. The murder of air force Gen. Licio Giorgieri in Rome on March 20, 1987, was the last terrorist act for which a branch of the Red Brigades claimed responsibility. A month before that, the Red Brigades for the Formation of Fighting Communist Party claimed responsibility for an armored car robbery in Rome. In December 1981, Red Brigade terrorists disguised as plumbers kidnapped U.S. Brig. Gen. James Dozier, who was with the NATO command in Italy, from his home in Verona.

The arrival of 700 to 800 of the $2 billion Thyssen collection\\'s most significant paintings will cement the Spanish capital\\'s reputation as a leading world art center. The agreement was signed by collector Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and the Spanish government. The ceremony took place across the street from Prado museum in the 19th-century Villahermosa Palace, which Spanish authorities are refurbishing to devote exclusively to the new works. The collection is expected to open to the public in November. Thyssen said his decision to chose Spain over museums in the United States, Switzerland and West Germany was ``completely objective\\'\\' but stressed that his ties to Spain played a deciding role. The Baron\\'s fifth wife, Spanish-born Carmen Cervera, was an important factor in the final decision, according one of the plan\\'s chief architects, the Duke of Badajoz, who also is the brother-in-law of King Juan Carlos. Cervera, a former beauty queen and widow of ``Tarzan\\'\\' actor Lex Barker, ``has a great influence over her husband,\\'\\' he said. The duke said Thyssen had not yet completed the choice of which paintings would make up the Madrid collection, but the agreement stipulates they include ``the most significant paintings\\'\\' of the Thyssen collection. The duke said the 10-year loan agreement paves the way for a second pact to make Spain the collection\\'s permanent home. ``It takes away a bit of the tension,\\'\\' he said. ``Now we can proceed with calm to work out the definitive agreement.\\'\\' A beaming Culture Minister Javier Solana said the collection ``is going to fundamentally improve the cultural life of our country.\\'\\' The Swiss-based Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Trust, headed by the baron, owns 1,600 paintings from the 13th to 20th centuries, including 570 old masters. The collection was started by his father, Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a German steel baron who died in 1947. News that Thyssen was looking for a bigger home for the bulk of the paintings currently housed at his Villa Favorita residence in Lugano, Switzerland, elicited offers from Spain, the Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., and museums in several West German cities. The 10-year loan is to be administered by a private foundation set up by the Spanish government and Thyssen, and chaired by the baron. The agreement stipulates that the pieces on loan to Spain will be able to travel freely to other museums without prior approval from Spanish authorities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  dollar yen late london gold bid ounce dealers fell trading troy bank tokyo price west rates francs currency compared close &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.895672441142999  \\n   The &lt;b&gt; dollar &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; fell &lt;/b&gt; against most major currencies in European &lt;b&gt; trading &lt;/b&gt; today.

They said the mark rose amid speculation that the Bundesbank would raise its Lombard rate by a half percentage point to 5.5 percent. The Lombard rate is the interest the central &lt;b&gt; bank &lt;/b&gt; charges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as collateral.

He and I were governors together,\\'\\' said Carter, who was governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and won the presidency in 1976. Carter said the Massachusetts governor ``is highly competent. I think among all the governors, he would be voted one of the top ones in administrative ability, in vision and competence and sound judgment.\\'\\' Carter said Dukakis\\' nomination was ``the obvious likelihood now\\'\\' and predicted ``he will do well\\'\\' against Bush. As a former Democratic president, Carter is a delegate to the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; in Atlanta this summer. He said it is still his intention to go to the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; as an uncommitted delegate because he &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; the candidates earlier that he would not choose among them until the convention. &lt;/p&gt; 0.51658736644396  \\n   Illinois Republican Gov. James Thompson came to this &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; city to taunt the Democrats, but wound up hinting that he\\'d make a good &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate for GOP candidate George Bush. As the Democrats embraced the ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, who differ on a number of issues, Thompson stressed his compatibility with the &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. ``George Bush and I agree on a lot of things,\\'\\' said Thompson, a four-term governor who was an early Bush supporter. ``I\\'m too moderate for some people, but I\\'ve never been &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; I\\'m too moderate for George Bush,\\'\\' he said. Thompson was careful to avoid sounding overly eager as a job applicant. Vice &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; hopefuls traditionally refrain from tooting their own horns. ``There are a number of qualified candidates,\\'\\' Thompson said. ``There\\'s no lack of talent in our party.\\'\\' Thompson\\'s &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; gave Bush a boost in the Illinois primary, where he thrashed his GOP rivals after an impressive showing in the South. Since then, Thompson has been mentioned as a &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; prospect, and ``Thompson-Bush\\'\\' bumper stickers have appeared in Springfield, the Illinois capital. Thompson was in Atlanta on Wednesday to carry the GOP banner. He clearly relished the task, signaling what\\'s certain to be a Republican effort to focus attention on Jesse Jackson as part of the Democratic team. ``Gov. Dukakis has accepted Jesse Jackson as his partner in this campaign, elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps higher than his nominal &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate, Lloyd Bentsen,\\'\\' Thompson &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; reporters. Thompson said it was a clever strategy by Dukakis to offer Bentsen as ``the soothing, reassuring conservative.\\'\\' But he said, ``my guess is those two partners of the troika, Dukakis and Jackson, will soon leave Bentsen in the dust.\\'\\' Thompson added: ``With Bentsen whispering in one ear and Jackson whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen to? ... I think that\\'s the question the American people need to have answered.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.498473725482628  \\n   Talk of a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; is making some Democrats shudder, while former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip\\'\\' O\\'Neill says he thinks it would be a lot of fun and other party leaders say the scenario probably will be avoided one way or another. ``A brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; is nothing,\\'\\' said O\\'Neill on Wednesday evening. He recalled the brokered 1952 &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; that nominated Adlai Stevenson and said, ``It was enjoyable ... it makes it more fun.\\'\\' ``If I had my way _ they talk about the smoke-filled rooms _ we ought to open them up to the TV and the press,\\'\\' he said in an interview Wednesday night. Sen. Paul Simon\\'s favorite-son &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; victory in Illinois on Tuesday brought the brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; speculation to the fore, along with concerns that the Democrats could only be hurt by such a lack of unity. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who some hope would emerge the nominee if there were a deadlocked convention, condemned the possibility as ``the best way to give this election away to the Republicans.\\'\\' He joined Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk in calling for the Democratic leadership to unify behind the front-runner when the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; season ends in June, rather than wait until the July &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; in Atlanta. Simon, reviving his faltering campaign, took most of the &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; in Illinois, with the other home-state candidate, Jesse Jackson, coming in second and taking the rest of the delegates. Simon said no one will have enough &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to lock up the nomination before the convention, and added, ``We\\'re going to have to work out some kind of a compromise.\\'\\' Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who currently holds a slim lead in delegates, said the party should unite behind the front-runner at the end of the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; season, and that encouraging a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; ``would be a very dangerous thing.\\'\\' ``I think there is agreement on the part of most Democrats across the country that somebody will come out of this &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; process with, if not an absolute majority, a substantial plurality ... and that people will rally behind that person. Obviously, I hope I will be that person,\\'\\' the governor said in Boston. But other prominent Democrats, interviewed Wednesday at a congressional dinner, professed not to be worried about the deadlocked &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; prospect, mostly because they don\\'t think it will come to that. ``Nobody said the process had to end by March,\\'\\' said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But he said he thinks his candidate, Dukakis, will have enough &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to take the nomination by June, and that ``the process is going to work its way out.\\'\\' Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, who opted not to seek the &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; nomination this year, said he doubts anyone will have a winning cache of &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; in June. But he predicted that the party would unite behind a candidate before the convention. Nonetheless, he added, ``I don\\'t fear a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; ... I don\\'t think any harm comes from it.\\'\\' After Illinois, Dukakis had 464.5 delegate votes, Jackson 460.55 and Simon 171.5. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee had 354.8 and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri 145. Uncommitted &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; totaled 272.65 of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination. Boosted by his Illinois win, Simon plans to &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; vigorously for the upcoming Michigan caucuses March 26 and the Wisconsin &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; April 5. Gore, who fared poorly in Illinois, said he is ``almost prepared\\'\\' to agree that the race will still be fluid at the convention. ``I still think this process is likely to produce a winner before the first ballot is over,\\'\\' Gore said. ``The results (from Illinois) ... make it more likely we will go to a second ballot.\\'\\' Gephardt, who skipped Illinois to try to resuscitate his &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; in Michigan, said the Democratic battle could go all the way. ``The race is wide open,\\'\\' he said in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``I think if I can get a good result in Michigan, which I think I can, I\\'m going to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great chance to be the nominee.\\'\\' House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said Wednesday night he anticipated he would be involved in any discussions to unite behind a candidate before the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; if no one had the winning number of &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; in June. He said a brokered &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; wouldn\\'t be the worst thing, but added, ``All things considered, it would be desirable if it didn\\'t happen.\\'\\' Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey on Wednesday signaled the likelihood that he, too, would help in early selection of a nominee. First, he &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; party leaders in his home &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; that he would endorse a candidate before the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; there June 7, with Dukakis the favorite for his backing. And he said party leaders should halt an effort to put together an uncommitted delegate slate for the state. Victory for such a slate, he said, could cause problems for the front-running candidate when the &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; is held. &lt;/p&gt; 0.479709693591917  \\n   Michael Dukakis, the clear Democratic front-runner after beating Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. in New York, said today the party\\'s runner-up after the primaries won\\'t necessarily be the &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; choice. Gore, conceding ``things didn\\'t turn out exactly as I planned,\\'\\' suspended his &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; but said he would hang on to the &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; he\\'s won so far. ``I want no part of a stop-Jackson or stop-Dukakis movement. The only man I want to stop is George Bush and we\\'re going to stop George Bush, Gore said, bringing applause from supporters at a news conference in a Senate office building. ``Technically, I shall remain a candidate for the nomination but only to enable my &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to go to the &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; so they can represent our point of view in our party\\'s deliberations,\\'\\' he said. Gore, the youngest candidate in the race, joked that in the campaign, ``I was doing great until I turned 40.\\'\\' Jackson, in Pennsylvania, brushed aside surveys suggesting he faces an uphill fight in next week\\'s &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; in that state. ``I do not follow opinion polls, I mold opinion,\\'\\' Jackson &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; cheering supporters in Philadelphia. Gore\\'s decision to merely suspend his &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; followed a similar action by Sen. Paul Simon earlier. Both Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning today in Pennsylvania, where 178 Democratic &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; are at stake on Tuesday. Dukakis was going on to Ohio, which holds its &lt;b&gt; primary &lt;/b&gt; a week later. Dukakis, asked about a potential &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate during an interview with The Associated Press, said, ``I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination or it looks as if it\\'s pretty well in hand.\\'\\' Some Jackson backers were beginning to float the idea of Jackson as a possible &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; mate if Dukakis were the nominee. ``There would be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket,\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; chairman Willie Brown &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; The New York Times. But Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said such a ticket was unlikely. Kirk, in comments published in today\\'s Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said, ``Only once in 19 elections since the turn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placed second and asked him to run. It was 1960.\\'\\' Dukakis himself said, ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn\\'t entitle me to anything more than consideration, period.\\'\\' He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer questions about the &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; presidency away from Jackson. ``The nominee makes that decision _ as he (Jackson) himself said. And rightly so,\\'\\' Dukakis said. On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush continued his march to the nomination, with 1,052 of the 1,139 &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; needed to nominate. Bush was endorsed Wednesday by California Gov. George Deukmejian, who had initially pledged neutrality through the June 7 California primary. But Bush\\'s only remaining competitor is Pat Robertson, who has all but halted his campaign. Simon\\'s suspension of his Democratic &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; earlier this month drew fire from Jackson, who complained bitterly about the Illinois\\' senator\\'s decision to keep a lock on &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; that would otherwise have gone to him. Jackson &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; spokesman Bob Brosage brushed aside talk of Jackson as &lt;b&gt; vice &lt;/b&gt; president. ``We\\'re still &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; for president,\\'\\' he said. ``There are significant primaries to come.\\'\\' And Jackson himself gave no indication he\\'s giving up his drive for the nomination. ``We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,\\'\\' he &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; an enthusiastic crowd of 3,500 at a Philadelphia rally. Jackson was also picking up the endorsement today of the Philadelphia Daily News. A survey commissioned by the newspaper, in concert with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, suggested this week that Dukakis had a 3-1 lead in the state. Even so, ``Jesse Jackson can win,\\'\\' the Daily News said in an editorial. Financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission indicated Jackson had his best fund-raising month ever in March, raising $2.8 million. But Dukakis, whose &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; has been well bankrolled all along, raised $3.4 million during the same period. Jackson\\'s stops in Pennsylvania today ranged from a high school to a labor rally to a homeless shelter. Dukakis was heading for Pittsburgh tonight, after spending a day in Boston following the New York primary. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, at a Democratic dinner in Washington Wednesday night, was eager to move beyond the raucous contest in his home state. ``I expect the &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; will be converted to an intelligent, civilized exchange of opinions,\\'\\' he said. Dukakis is comfortably ahead of Jackson in the delegate count, getting a boost Wednesday from the selection of congressional ``super delegates.\\'\\' The latest Associated Press delegate count gives Dukakis 1,063.15; Jackson 841.1; Gore 421.55; and uncommitted 613.75, out of 2,081 needed to nominate. But Dukakis was doing his best to dampen any talk of inevitability. When he was introduced at a Statehouse reception in Massachusetts as ``the next president of the United States,\\'\\' he grinned but quickly cautioned: ``Steady as she goes.\\'\\' In one respect, however, Dukakis was behaving as if he were the nominee, focusing attacks on Bush, who is all but certain to carry the GOP banner in the fall. ``I\\'m a doer,\\'\\' Dukakis said Wednesday, saying that characteristic stands in ``sharp contrast to the Republican nominee.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.451467600268355  \\n   Democratic &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; contender Michael Dukakis said today at the White House that the Reagan administration\\'s anti-terrorist policy is worthless because of arms dealing with Iran. In the Midwest Republican Bob Dole taunted George Bush for refusing to compete in Minnesota and South Dakota. Dukakis, speaking to reporters after a National Governors\\' Association meeting with the president, said, ``I\\'d have a much tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy.\\'\\' The Massachusetts governor, referring to the sale of arms to Iran during secret negotiations to free American hostages, said, ``We\\'ll be living with the consequences of what happened in 1985 for a long time.\\'\\' ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless. And that\\'s what we did,\\'\\' said Dukakis. Asked about Dukakis\\' statement, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I think it\\'s very dangerous to make terrorism a political issue, especially when you\\'re talking about specific episodes. Vice President Bush, who has said repeatedly he supported Reagan\\'s Iran initiative but was involved with few details, was campaigning in South Carolina today. But Dole, in Duluth, Minn., was suggesting Bush wasn\\'t where he should have been. Minnesota and South Dakota, the next two events on the long road to the 1988 &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; nominations, vote on Tuesday. ``We\\'re ready to do well here tomorrow. We\\'re here to play,\\'\\' Dole &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; supporters in Duluth today. ``I don\\'t know where George Bush is,\\'\\' Dole said. ``I didn\\'t find him yesterday in Wyoming. Couldn\\'t find him in South Dakota. Couldn\\'t find him in Minnesota. Must be somewhere. And these are very important states. Later today we\\'re going to send him a map of Minnesota so at least he gets a little idea where it is.\\'\\' Among the Democrats, Richard Gephardt, who also finished first in Iowa, is bidding for a strong showing in South Dakota\\'s Democratic straw poll to give him a boost as the &lt;b&gt; campaign &lt;/b&gt; moves toward the Super Tuesday showdown on March 8. The 4,067 Minnesota caucuses are the first step toward choosing 78 &lt;b&gt; delegates &lt;/b&gt; to the Democratic National Convention, while on the Republican side caucus attendees will mark a non-binding straw ballot to express their &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; preference. In South Dakota\\'s primary, Republican voters will determine allocation of 18 &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; delegates, while the Democrats will hold a beauty contest ballot that will not have a binding effect on who gets the state\\'s national &lt;b&gt; convention &lt;/b&gt; delegates. Bush, faced with the potential of a repeat of the Iowa results in which Midwesterner Dole was a big winner, is concentrating on the South where he hopes to cripple the Kansas senator\\'s effort. Dole is a strong favorite in South Dakota, while Minnesota is shaping up as a three-way fight between Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former television evangelist Pat Robertson. Dukakis, winner of the New Hampshire Democratic &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; primary, is campaigning hard in both these upper Midwest states in an effort to prove he can win &lt;b&gt; support &lt;/b&gt; outside his native New England. After an appearance at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, including a session with President Reagan, Dukakis was flying to Minnesota to campaign. On his way into the White House for a black-tie dinner Sunday night, Dukakis quipped, ``I\\'m just looking the place over, that\\'s all.\\'\\' Asked where he hoped to be next year, Dukakis replied, ``I hope right here.\\' Gephardt, who has made tough action to correct trade imbalances a cornerstone of his campaign, got a blow from his House colleagues when words came out they planned to scuttle his legislation that would impose sanctions on countries that maintain large trade surpluses with the United States through unfair practices. ``We\\'re going to dump it because it\\'s bad policy,\\'\\' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the Trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``I\\'m going to fight for my amendment,\\'\\' said Gephardt, when &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; of the plan. Much of the sniping between &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; rivals was being done by long distance. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who made little effort in Iowa and not much more in New Hampshire while pursuing a Southern strategy for the Democratic nomination, was interviewed on the NBC show ``Meet the Press\\'\\' on Sunday and got in jabs at both Dukakis and Gephardt. The senator attacked Gephardt for shifting positions. ``It\\'s not a case of just having one or two or three issues where he has changed 180 degrees,\\'\\' said Gore. ``There is a long, long list of issues.\\'\\' Turning to Dukakis, Gore said the governor has not had ``a single day\\'s experience in foreign policy.\\'\\' Dukakis\\' spokesman Leslie Dach quickly retorted that ``Al Gore\\'s never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building an economy.\\'\\' Gephardt was attacking Dukakis in ads &lt;b&gt; running &lt;/b&gt; in South Dakota that criticize the Massachusetts governor for not supporting farm legislation sponsored by Gephardt and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. The ads also take a shot at Dukakis for once suggesting in Iowa that farmers ought to consider diversifying into such crops as Belgian endive. The ads drew retorts from Dukakis supporters in both Minnesota and South Dakota. ``A new low in South Dakota &lt;b&gt; presidential &lt;/b&gt; politics,\\'\\' said State Sen. Roger McKellips, a co-chairman of Dukakis\\' South Dakota campaign. After his surprising second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Robertson was considered a strong contender in Minnesota where caucus organization is once again important. The former evangelist was in Spartanburg, S.C., on Sunday and &lt;b&gt; told &lt;/b&gt; a crowd of about 4,000 at a church dedication that ``the problem facing America is not a government problem but a moral problem.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  immigration united cuba states cuban illegal aliens cubans czechoslovakia havel communist ins prague castro czechoslovak embassy diplomatic havana apply justice &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.392362370466602  \\n   Since the prison disturbances by Mariel Cuban detainees last fall, the government has released more than 1,000 of the detainees into halfway houses or with family sponsors in communities, the Justice Department announced Friday. One of the triggers to last year\\'s uprisings at federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was the fact that the government was taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were deemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for the detainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble finding halfway house space for the detainees. From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in November, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released 106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A total of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances. INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots. Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the denials have been decided since the uprisings. When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detainees in various facilities. The Justice Department also announced it plans to repatriate 14 Mariel Cubans, the first group of detainees designated for return to Cuba since the prison disturbances. The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences for crimes committed in the United States, have been notified that the INS intends to send them back, the Justice Department said. Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of crimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape. The repatriation process will include a review of their cases by a Justice Department review panel under an agreement which ended the rioting at Atlanta and Oakdale. Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to submit additional information on their behalf to the Justice Department review panels, which specifically exclude &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; officers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.376502286739609  \\n   A 101-year-old Mexican who was smuggled into the United States in the back seat of his son\\'s car 14 years ago became the oldest alien to gain legal status under the amnesty program, officials said Friday. ``Gracias, muchas gracias a todos (Thank you very much everyone),\\'\\' Carlos Romero-Gaitan said as he was presented a temporary residency permit, or green card, by Howard Ezell, western regional director the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In recent weeks, Ezell and other INS officials have taken pains to publicize the impending May 4 deadline to &lt;b&gt; apply &lt;/b&gt; for amnesty. Romero-Gaitan, who was born in San Pedro, worked on a hacienda and as a rodeo rider, and operated a Guadalajara tortilla shop until his retirement at age 82 in 1968. When his wife died in 1974, his son Carlos Jr. of Watsonville, Calif., flew to Guadalajara and took him by plane to Tijuana, where they got into a waiting car. With the father asleep in the back, Carlos Jr. drove to the border. ``They (the Border Patrol) asked everyone else in the car for identification, but they didn\\'t want to disturb the man who was asleep, so he got through clean,\\'\\' INS spokesman Joe Flanders said. Flanders said Romero-Gaitan has lived ever since in Watsonville, tending the family\\'s garden, watching cowbody shows and boxing matches on television and venturing out to an annual rodeo in the Salinas area. Romero-Gaitan said Friday that he decided to &lt;b&gt; apply &lt;/b&gt; for amnesty now ``so I can feel free to go out of my house and not be afraid of being picked up.\\'\\' Four of his five children are alive and live in the United States and Mexico.

CTK quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the grace period should permit Havana ``to cope with the new situation, without jeopardizing its interests in the U.S.A.\\'\\' The Czechoslovak Embassy has represented Cuban interests in Washington since 1977. Diplomatic and consular ties between Cuba and the United States were severed in January 1961. Interests sections enable countries to maintain &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; contact without having to have full-fledged embassies. A senior Cuban &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; official in Washington, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the Cuban government has no alternate plan in mind at present to replace the current arrangement with the Czechoslovak government. He said he assumes both the Cuban and U.S. governments wish to maintain a &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; presence in each other\\'s capital and that Cuba will seek a new arrangement. The official said he had seen news reports about Prague\\'s decision but had heard nothing officially. U.S. &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; activities in Havana have been carried out under the auspices of the Swiss embassy. One &lt;b&gt; diplomatic &lt;/b&gt; source suggested that Cuba may ask the Swiss to perform that function for Cuba in Washington. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry source as saying that ``the different opinions of the two countries on the exercising of human rights\\'\\' and other fundamental differences prompted the Czechoslovak decision. Czechoslovakia has become a democracy following the revolution that toppled the Communist leadership one year ago; Cuba remains Communist-ruled. The ministry source suggested that deteriorating relations after Czechoslovakia embraced democracy contributed to Prague\\'s decision, CTK said. He singled out the storming of Czechoslovak &lt;b&gt; embassy &lt;/b&gt; premises in Havana in July by Cubans who claimed they were dissidents but who the Czechoslovaks believe were in the pay of the Cuban government. The invasion of the &lt;b&gt; embassy &lt;/b&gt; ``can be rightfully presumed to have been intended to discredit the new Czechoslovak regime in the eyes of the Cuban public,\\'\\' CTK quoted the source as saying. Efforts to contact the Czechoslovak &lt;b&gt; embassy &lt;/b&gt; in Washington by telephone were unavailing. &lt;/p&gt; 0.365187116447699  \\n   At least 12 Mariel prisoners have apparently exhausted their administrative appeals and could be deported within days, but plans are in the works by prisoner advocates to block any deportations, a newspaper reported Thursday. Gary Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed by the Justice Department that there would be an announcement Thursday on the prisoners. Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in Miami and Atlanta plan to ask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried out would mark the first time Cubans have been deported to their &lt;b&gt; communist &lt;/b&gt; homeland since May 1985, The Miami Herald reported. ``There is a chance if we all speak with one &lt;b&gt; united &lt;/b&gt; voice here and explain the merits of our case,\\'\\' said Rafael Penalver, chairman of the Task Force of Cuban American Citizen Organizations. Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in Oakdale, La., and at an Atlanta prison last November. ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He can block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the airport.\\'\\' A special three-member Justice Department panel was created in the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Mariel detainees in federal prison in Talladega, Ala. In the past two months, the panel has looked at prison records, &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; history, written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but there have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers. Deportations to Cuba were reinstated as part of a renewed &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; pact between the United States and Cuba that allows up to 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families to emigrate and, in return, the Cuban government will take back 2,500 prisoners. The Justice Department contends that these prisoners are criminals the Cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from the port of Mariel. Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of Mariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984 &lt;b&gt; immigration &lt;/b&gt; pact. Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, acknowledges there is much division over the deporations, even in Dade County\\'s Cuban exile community. He said the foundation favors letting Cubans &lt;b&gt; apply &lt;/b&gt; for visas to immigrate to the United States but opposes the deportations to Cuba. ``I cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation in Cuba and then support sending them back,\\'\\' Mas said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.363299074150423  \\n   An attorney for 13 Cuban detainees argued Tuesday they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylum before being sent back to the homeland they fled in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Lee Ochoa of Miami, an attorney for 13 of 15 Cubans convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, told U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon that some of the Cubans were afraid to go home because they did not know how they would be treated by Fidel Castro\\'s government. Clemon said he will rule Monday on whether to allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to fly the 13 back to Cuba. Clemon said he wanted to give attorneys for the Cubans time to support their request for a preliminary order blocking the deportation. The INS on Nov. 17 notified 15 Cubans at at the Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega that they would be deported within 72 hours. However, the next day the government promised Clemon it would not send them home until their attorneys had a chance to study their files. Leo Ochoa of Miami, attorney for 13 of the 15, told Clemon that they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym and to due process. ``In this country we want to do things fairly and properly,\\'\\' Ochoa said. But Lauri Fillppu of the INS said that the Cubans\\' only claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in Cuba. He said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court in Atlanta already had rejected that argument. Fillppu questioned what he called ``a last-minute tactic\\'\\' by the Cubans, claiming there was no new evidence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  cents farmers cent lower prices higher futures corn agriculture tons grain wheat bushel market crop farm drought soybean agricultural production &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.77791170723425  \\n   Grain and &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; were mixed in volatile early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.

However, traders began to liquidate their positions for the weekend, and &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; were moving lower. Soybean &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; were steady to slightly &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; as soggy fields delay the planting of the &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; crop. But the potential for increased &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; acreage as &lt;b&gt; farmers &lt;/b&gt; switch from &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; is weighing on prices. Wheat &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; on reports that disease is spreading through the soft red winter &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; crop &lt;/b&gt; in the southern Midwest, Lespinasse said. In early trading, &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; was a { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; to 1 &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; with the contract for delivery in July at $3.35\\\\ a bushel; &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; was 1 &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to 3 &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; with July at $2.87 a bushel; oats were } &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to 1 &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; with July at $1.48{ a bushel; soybeans were a \\\\ &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; to 2 &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; with July at $6.02{ a bushel.

Cattle &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; on follow-through buying from Thursday\\'s strong close and on active meat sales. Pork &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; plunged on fund liquidation due to &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; cash prices.

Reports that the Soviet Union had cut off oil shipments to the breakaway republic triggered speculation that the United States will back away from granting the Soviets most favored nation trade status. The designation would allow for freer trade between the superpowers. Forecasts for increasingly wet, warm weather in the Midwestern croplands prompted further selling this morning. Rain was expected in the region today and Friday, and the National Weather Service has predicted above-normal temperatures for the Midwest during the latter half of next week. Higher &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; for &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; meal in Europe helped to limit losses in the &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; market.

Grain &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; closed mixed to lower. Soybean &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; opened &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; on news that rain had eased dry conditions in the soybean-growing region of Brazil. Later in the morning, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimated the impending harvest would yield 19.4 million metric tons, significantly &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; than the U.S. Agriculture Department\\'s latest estimate of 18.5 million metric tons. ``This estimate was obviously negative for the U.S. market, and it took off any rallying attempt the beans might have had,\\'\\' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. Grain and &lt;b&gt; soybean &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; futures &lt;/b&gt; also retreated in reaction to generally &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; for other commodities, Spilka said. Losses in &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; were limited by expectations of new Soviet purchases, he said. At the close, &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; was 2 &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to 1 &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; with the contract for delivery in March at $3.18 a bushel; &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; was unchanged to { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; with March at $1.98{ a bushel; oats were { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to } &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; with March at $1.90} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; to 3\\\\ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; with March at $6.22 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt; 0.679714597098978  \\n   Futures &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; for grains and soybeans were mostly &lt;b&gt; higher &lt;/b&gt; at the close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. ``There was a pretty good rally in soy oil that gave soybeans a good boost,\\'\\' said Joel Karlin, analyst with Research Department Inc. ``India bought into the palm oil market. African countries have shown some interest in vegetable oils, too.\\'\\' Corn was supported by a rumor that the Soviet Union might be interested in as much as 1 million tons, he said. Export news sent &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; higher, said Susan Leighty, grains analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed rumors that China had bid for 300,000 &lt;b&gt; tons &lt;/b&gt; of the U.S. commodity, and rumors persisted that the Chinese would bid for 300,000 &lt;b&gt; tons &lt;/b&gt; more. The Soviet Union was also said to be in the &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; for 500,000 &lt;b&gt; tons &lt;/b&gt; of export bonus wheat, she said. Also firming &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; were weather reports calling for mild conditions in the next few days that might make the winter &lt;b&gt; crop &lt;/b&gt; more vulnerable to a cold snap later, Mrs. Leighty said. At the close, &lt;b&gt; wheat &lt;/b&gt; was 1 &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; to 1{ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; higher, with the contract for March at $4.10} a bushel; &lt;b&gt; corn &lt;/b&gt; was \\\\ &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; lower &lt;/b&gt; to { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; higher, with March at $2.37} a bushel; oats were { &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; to 2{ &lt;b&gt; cent &lt;/b&gt; lower, with March at $1.50}, and soybeans were 2 &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; to 6{ &lt;b&gt; cents &lt;/b&gt; higher, with January at $5.67 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  mexico mexican taylor miss salinas cows pageant milk shark america mexico\\'s wynberg hormone carlos border positive burton bst castaneda rocky &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.476114516313481  \\n   It was ``an act of God\\'\\' that brought two love-struck bulls together with the &lt;b&gt; cows &lt;/b&gt; next door, says a man accused of negligence for failing to keep them apart. The bulls were unexpectedly freed from their pen when a tree limb felled by a storm crushed the fence enclosing them. They headed for Maggie and Blackbird, two pure-bred &lt;b&gt; cows &lt;/b&gt; awaiting artificial insemination by a $770,000, prize-winning Angus bull named Broadway. Since the bulls, aged 9 and 13 months, may have beaten Broadway\\'s time with the cows, the cows\\' owners were advised to wait 60 to 90 days before artificial insemination, to make sure Broadway was the father. Though this was done, the owners are suing Kirk Hardin, caretaker of the bulls and cows, for $39,000, accusing him of negligence in not keeping the guys and gals apart. Lonnie Pembrook, owner of Pembrook Cattle Co. near Fairview, and Tom Young, a New Jersey businessman, each owned a half-interest in Blackbird. Pembrook owns Maggie. Hardin, a specialist in artificial insemination and embryo transfer techniques, contends the fence mishap, in the fall of 1986, was an ``act of God\\'\\' that could not have been prevented or foreseen. The trial began Monday before a Payne County jury, and testimony ended Tuesday. Closing arguments are scheduled Friday. After the artificial insemination took place, the embryos were frozen, according to testimony. Pembrook picked up the frozen embryos in October, but there was no testimony on whether the embryos had since been placed in host cows. &lt;/p&gt; 0.394664977062178  \\n   Elizabeth Taylor ignored her ex-boyfriend in court Wednesday as their lawyers began selecting a jury to decide a multimillion-dollar dispute over the rights to her ``Passion\\'\\' perfume. Miss Taylor walked across the courtroom surrounded by her lawyers and made no acknowledgement of former beau Henry Wynberg, seated at the opposite end of a table. A panel of 50 prospective jurors sat with their eyes riveted on the actress, dressed in purple, as the judge explained what the trial was all about. Miss Taylor won permission earlier in the day to tell jurors about Wynberg\\'s criminal record after her lawyers said it would explain her decision to keep him out of her perfume business. Lawyers for Henry Wynberg sought to prevent jurors from hearing that Wynberg - who courted Miss Taylor between her two marriages to Richard Burton - once pleaded guilty to statutory rape, providing drugs to underage high school girls in return for sex and taking pornographic photos of young girls. They called the evidence ``irrelevant, inflammatory and prejudicial.\\'\\' But Miss Taylor\\'s lawyers argued that those issues were crucial to proving that she was justified in breaking off her business relationship with Wynberg ``because any reputable cosmetics company would refuse to deal with Wynberg.\\'\\' Superior Court Judge Coleman Swart declined to bar the evidence. Wynberg claims he conceived the actress\\' line of ``Passion\\'\\' perfume, and he\\'s seeking a hefty share of the profits. He says he created the fragrance under the Elizabeth Taylor Cosmetics Inc. banner. At stake: about $70 million a year in profits. Litigation has produced volumes of depositions and affidavits about Wynberg\\'s claim that he had a contract with Miss Taylor for exclusive rights to her name and likeness for promotion and sale of cosmetics. Wynberg sued in 1986 for 72 percent of ``Passion\\'\\' profits. Court documents show Wynberg\\'s two-year romance with the violet-eyed actress ended in August 1975, when Miss Taylor said, ``I\\'m going back to Richard, Henry. I\\'ll see you later.\\'\\' Burton and Miss Taylor remarried in Africa, and Wynberg returned to California. Court records show that a short time later, Miss Taylor and Wynberg signed the cosmetics agreement in Switzerland, with Burton as a witness. Wynberg said he spent years consulting with chemists and manufacturers, smelling perfumes and looking for the perfect bottle. ``I wanted sparkling little lights like stars in there, and I wanted it to look like money, feel like money,\\'\\' Wynberg said. According to Wynberg, Hen he presented the actress with the heart-shaped bottle and fragrance in November 1983, Miss Taylor said: ``Let\\'s let bygones be bygones, Henry. Let\\'s split 50-50 on the perfume deal.\\'\\' In a deposition, Miss Taylor denies Wynberg\\'s assertion. ``I didn\\'t want to do any business with him,\\'\\' she said. Miss Taylor contends that Wynberg\\'s failure to follow through on the project violated the contract and made it invalid. In 1986 she signed with the Chesebrough-Ponds Inc. cosmetics company to market ``Passion\\'\\' using her name and likeness. It went on to be a big seller. &lt;/p&gt; 0.346147855963656  \\n   A woman who dropped out of the 1988 Miss USA &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; after being charged with shoplifting pleaded guilty Wednesday. During her appearance in Hennepin County District Court, former Miss Minnesota-USA Sue Bolich, 24, of Mound admitted stealing several items from the Dayton\\'s store at the Southdale shopping mall. She was arrested Jan. 22. Police said she had taken $370 worth of items, including a swimsuit, silk scarves and hairpieces. In exchange for her guilty plea, she will be placed in a program while she receives counseling. ``It\\'s fair for a first-time alleged offender like Susie, and I think things will turn out fine for her,\\'\\' said Bolich\\'s attorney, Peter Timmons. Bolich\\'s successor to the Miss Minnesota-USA title also withdrew before the Miss USA pageant, after it was reported that she had pleaded guilty to shoplifting in 1986. &lt;/p&gt; 0.338342307362292  \\n   A teen-ager who required 110 stitches after a &lt;b&gt; shark &lt;/b&gt; attack in southeastern Australia said Friday that his surfing days are over. Murray Taylor, 15, said the ``huge shark\\'\\' dragged him from his surfboard and bit him repeatedly. Murray said he escaped by punching the &lt;b&gt; shark &lt;/b&gt; on the nose and trying to gouge its eyes. The attack occurred Thursday at Moana Beach, 30 miles south of Adelaide. ``When he reached the shore he actually walked up the beach on his own,\\'\\' said Murray\\'s mother, Wendy Richardson. ``Murray said he wasn\\'t sure how big the &lt;b&gt; shark &lt;/b&gt; was, but he said its head was at least a foot wide.\\'\\' The teen-ager was recuperating at Flinders Medical Center in Adelaide. &lt;/p&gt; 0.332970176259661  \\n   Three contestants in the Mrs. America &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; have complained about being given a survey to fill out on their love lives. According to Mrs. Alabama Diane Gamble, Mrs. Wisconsin Gale Coleman and Mrs. North Carolina Connie Hedrick, the survey included such questions as ``Can you be in love with two men at the same time?\\'\\' and ``Outside of the bedroom, where is the most unusual place you have had romance with your husband?\\'\\' Pageant president David Marmel said he had not seen the survey, adding that they were used in the past to find out types of products used by contestants for the product-marketing purposes of &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; sponsors. Marmel said the women were not obliged to answer the questions. The three contestants also complained Tuesday about the use of bikinis, saying the skimpy attire was degrading for a &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; featurng mothers and professional women. ``How is it going to look for my fellow workers to see me bumping and grinding in a bikini on national television? It\\'s demeaning, said Mrs. Gamble, a marketing director for an engineering firm. Only single-piece suits were used in state contests leading to the national pageant, she said. Jennifer Kline, 21, of Minnesota, won the &lt;b&gt; pageant &lt;/b&gt; that ended Sunday and was televised Tuesday by ABC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  million year sales billion percent share total company quarter corp products industry earnings american operations reported largest estimated market profit &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.752168768863863  \\n   Hilton Hotels Corp. &lt;b&gt; reported &lt;/b&gt; its &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; rose 22 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in the third &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; partly because of improved results in its casino operations. Hilton said Wednesday it earned $27.2 million, or 57 cents a share, in the &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; ended Sept. 30, up from $22.3 million, or 44 cents a share, a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. Sales totaled $236.1 million, up 19 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; from $198.2 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; earlier. Gambling revenue nearly doubled, jumping to $33.1 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; from $18.5 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; in the 1987 third quarter. The gain was partly due to better results at Hilton\\'s Nevada casinos and to the company\\'s interest in the Conrad International hotel-casino in Queensland, Australia. Operating revenue in the hotel sector declined 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $21 million. The drop was largely due to a one-time credit that boosted revenue in the 1987 &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; and a charge for taxes that depressed the figure for the latest quarter, said Roy Judge, a vice president and assistant to the chairman. Hilton said hotel occupancy increased to 71 percent, from 70 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago, while Nevada gaming occupancy reached 90 percent, against 83 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in 1987. For the &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; to date, &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; rose 17 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $95.7 million, or $1.99 a share, from $81.5 million, or $1.62 a share. Revenue in the nine-month period totaled $699.2 million, up 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; from $623.4 million. &lt;/p&gt; 0.733807466553406  \\n   New European business and better &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; margins on North American &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; boosted Whirlpool Corp.\\'s fourth-quarter &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; nearly 21 percent, the appliance manufacturer said Tuesday. Whirlpool said earned $49.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $12 million, or 17 cents a share, in the fourth &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; of 1988. The year-earlier period included a $45 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; loss on the sale of Whirlpool\\'s kitchen cabinet business. The company\\'s 1989 fourth-quarter results include $9.2 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; in writedowns connection with Whirlpool\\'s plans to close its Mount Sterling, Ky., plant. Revenue totaled $1.57 billion, up from $1.02 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; in the fourth &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; of 1988, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said. For the year, Whirlpool said it earned $187.2 million, or $2.70 a share, on revenue of $6.29 billion, up from $94.1 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $4.42 billion, in in 1988. Whirlpool became the world\\'s &lt;b&gt; largest &lt;/b&gt; appliance concern with the January 1989 acquisition of a $470 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; stake in the appliance division of Dutch electronics giant NV Philips. In line with the agreement, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said 1989 results included all of the revenue of the joint venture, Whirlpool International BV, and 53 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of its net earnings. Whirlpool International\\'s performance and strong &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; in North America helped boost earnings, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said. However, these gains were offset by several factors, including higher interest expense and taxes, Whirlpool said. David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool chairman and chief executive officer, predicted flat &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; to come and said wage cuts accepted by Whirlpool workers in Evansville, Ind., would help keep costs competitive. Whitwam predicted appliance &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; would be down slightly in the first half of 1990, possibly rallying in the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt; 0.729792065674015  \\n   Avon Products Inc. said Wednesday its third &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; jumped 29 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; on slightly higher &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; of its beauty goods.

Sotheby\\'s, which announced its &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; in New York, said its net income came to $113 million, or $1.96 a share, in 1989 compared with $62 million, or $1.10 a share, in 1988. Sotheby\\'s said its revenue rose 40 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $445 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; from $317 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; in 1988. For the fourth quarter, net income increased 94 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $62 million, or $1.07 a share, from $32 million, or 56 cents a share, a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 48 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $200 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; from $135 million. Michael Ainslie, Sotheby\\'s president, said in a statement that the results showed ``we have further strengthened our leadership postion in the international art market.\\'\\' Sotheby\\'s auction &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 62 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $2.95 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; for the &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; and 76 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $1.49 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; for the quarter. Christies said in London that its net &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; for the &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; came to 40 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds, or $64 million, compared with 24.8 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds in 1988. Earnings per &lt;b&gt; share &lt;/b&gt; came to 23.4 pence, or 38 cents, compared with 14.8 pence. Christies said its pre-tax &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; rose 57 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 66.9 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds, or $108 million, from 42.5 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds. Sales soared 71 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to 1.33 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; pounds, or $2.1 billion, from 777 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; pounds in 1988. Christies Chairman Lord Carrington said &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; in 1990 are ahead of a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. Growth in the breadth of interest in art, he said, allows the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; to ``look forward to the 1990s with optimism.\\'\\' Christies didn\\'t break out quarterly or six month results. It isn\\'t required to under British law. &lt;/p&gt; 0.683501740690939  \\n   General Motors Corp. and &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; analysts credit the automaker\\'s 29 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; increase in its second-quarter &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; to a return to profitability in its North American automaking business and continued strong results overseas. GM barely broke even building cars and trucks in North America in 1987, reaping $3.56 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; in 1987 &lt;b&gt; profit &lt;/b&gt; from accounting changes, tax benefits and record contributions from its streamlined overseas businesses and its subsidiaries. But second-quarter revenue for the nation\\'s biggest automaker rose 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $29.9 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $26.7 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago, breaking the previous quarterly record of $27.6 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; set in 1986 when the auto &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; set a 16.3 million-vehicle annual &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; record. GM &lt;b&gt; reported &lt;/b&gt; net &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; of $1.5 billion, or $4.52 a common share, up from $1.17 billion, or $3.39 a common share, in the second &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. ``It was a good quarter. The number of units produced per employee went up almost 17 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; versus second-quarter last year. That\\'s phenomenally good, showing the kind of &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; General Motors can have if &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; pick up,\\'\\' said Ronald Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco. Car and light truck &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; in 1988 have continued to surge well ahead of pessimistic predictions issued in the wake of the October 1987 stock &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; crisis. Expectations for the &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; have risen to a consensus of about 15.6 &lt;b&gt; million &lt;/b&gt; vehicles, and GM has benefited from the industry\\'s surprisingly strong performance. ``Last year, (sales) volume was so low that most of their gains came from accounting changes. This year, it seems based on volume. Sales were strong in the first half, particularly in the second quarter,\\'\\' said Kathleen Heaney, analyst with Nikko Securities International in New York. Second-quarter revenue rose 12 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; from a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago and broke the previous GM record for any &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; of $27.6 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; set in 1986, GM said. The &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; were the best for any &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; since second &lt;b&gt; quarter &lt;/b&gt; 1984. GM also said that as of June 30, it had shaved $2.7 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; of the $4 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; it plans to trim from its costs during 1988. In the second quarter, operating income rose 64 percent, to $1.75 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $1.07 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; earlier. It rose 16 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in the first six months, to $2.4 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $2.08 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. GM said the improvement came both from a return to stronger profitability in North America and overseas performance stronger than last year\\'s record. However, GM said it does not provide income for different geographic areas on a quarterly basis. GM\\'s worldwide vehicle &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 9.3 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; in the second quarter, to 2.25 million. At the end of the second quarter, GM\\'s North American-built cars and light trucks held 35.1 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; of the U.S. market, up slightly from 33.8 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; at the end of June 1987. In the first six months of 1988, GM &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; rose 13.3 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; to $2.6 billion, or $7.63 a share, on revenue of $56.34 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; from $2.29 billion, or $6.65 a share, on revenue of $52.8 &lt;b&gt; billion &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; ago. On Wednesday, GM &lt;b&gt; reported &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; by its three subsidiaries _ General Motors Acceptance Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp., and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. GM blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings for an 18.9 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; drop in GMAC earnings. Second-quarter &lt;b&gt; earnings &lt;/b&gt; for EDS and Hughes were up 33 &lt;b&gt; percent &lt;/b&gt; and 16.4 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  health aids disease drug patients doctors treatment blood medical cancer research virus researchers study center fda immune university american system &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.673929140719054  \\n   The number of white &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cells infected by the AIDS &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; rises sharply in the year before virus-infected males actually develop the disease, says a &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; that may lead to speedier &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; for AIDS victims. While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is trying to develop a simpler test that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown AIDS, said the CDC\\'s Janet Nicholson. Such a test would help &lt;b&gt; doctors &lt;/b&gt; decide when the benefits of giving &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks, said Dr. Paul Volberding, associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and AIDS program director at San Francisco General Hospital. ``If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point, even if he hadn\\'t developed full-blown AIDS,\\'\\' he said. Nicholson, the CDC\\'s clinical immunology chief, presented her findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cells from 15 homosexual Atlanta men who were infected by the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didn\\'t suffer AIDS. Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, Nicholson said. She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected peripheral &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; mononuclear cells _ a class of white &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cells. If a simple test could show that someone infected with the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; soon will get AIDS, &lt;b&gt; doctors &lt;/b&gt; could better decide when to prescribe AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections that kill AIDS &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; once the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; has crippled their &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; systems, Volberding said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is believed to slow progression of AIDS. From a scientific standpoint, ``learning what a person\\'s risk of developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,\\'\\' he said. But Nicholson and Volberding acknowledged that some AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will develop &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; symptoms. Nicholson said &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; previously knew that people infected with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting white &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection progresses. Her &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; found that the number of helper cells decreases more quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in infected &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms. ``It\\'s not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will develop disease,\\'\\' she said, adding that her findings point the way toward determining which &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; are likely to do so. AIDS, or acquired &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; deficiency syndrome is caused by a &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; that damages the body\\'s &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. The CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991. &lt;/p&gt; 0.654384948653109  \\n   The Red Cross acknowledged Saturday it erred in distributing 24 pints of &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; that had failed AIDS procedures but said none of the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; was used and none carried the deadly virus. The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the questionable one-pint units were shipped last month to hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers in Washington and Nashville, Tenn., but were never used on any patients. The FDA did not identify the facilities that received the blood. ``While it should not have been shipped, it actually proved to be HIV (AIDS virus) free, and a number of units underwent processing that would inactivate the virus,\\'\\' said Gene Jeffers, American Red Cross spokesman. He said there was ``no known &lt;b&gt; health &lt;/b&gt; hazard associated with the 24 units of blood. We were very fortunate and lucked out in that there was no human risk at all involved here.\\'\\' Jeffers acknowledged, however, that five of the units tested positive for hepatitis B antigens and could have posed a &lt;b&gt; health &lt;/b&gt; risk had they been used in transfusions. However, they were not used, he said. Initial tests showed 10 of the questionable units contained HIV antibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those units underwent a process that breaks down the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; into components for specific uses and eliminates the virus, Jeffers said. The remaining nine units, he said, were from donors who were unacceptable because they previously tested ``false positive\\'\\' for AIDS, but all the actual units were tested as safe, he said. Federal officials estimate that the chances of getting AIDS, or acquired &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; deficiency syndrome, from a transfusion are one in 40,000. The chief victims have been homosexual men or intravenous &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; users. No one is known to have recovered from the &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; that attacks the body\\'s &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The Nashville Banner reported Saturday that two additional pints from disqualified donors were actually used in transfusions, but no patient was harmed. The newspaper gave no details of the transfusions but said follow-up tests of the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; donors showed they did not carry the AIDS virus. Jeffers said he knew of no actual transfusion of &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; that should have been rejected. The FDA report said none of the questionable &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; was used on patients. As a result of the errors, the FDA said it has increased its periodic audits of the &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; supply and instituted new training procedures for &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; bank employees. The mistake in Washington was discovered in a routine audit. The Tennessee errors came to light in an FDA investigation that followed a lawsuit against local &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; bank officials by a woman who said she became infected with AIDS through a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; transfusion. Two senior officials of the Washington regional office of the American Red Cross _ John McGraw and Frederick Darr _ have been suspended with pay for 30 days pending an investigation of their actions, said Richard Schubert, president of the American Red Cross. Schubert said no officials in the Nashville &lt;b&gt; center &lt;/b&gt; had been disciplined, but that the investigation there was continuing. Six of the questionable units of &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; were from the Washington &lt;b&gt; center &lt;/b&gt; and the other 18 were from Nashville, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.644204546928449  \\n   The Centers for Disease Control disputes a &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; by the Hudson Institute that the number of Americans infected with the deadly AIDS &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; is actually twice the official estimate. In a &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; released Friday, the Hudson Institute said that up to 3 million Americans are infected by the AIDS virus, an estimate that is far above the calculation by CDC, the primary federal agency monitoring the spread of AIDS. Kevin R. Hopkins, a Hudson mathematician, said his &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; uses ``realistic\\'\\' assumptions not used by the CDC and, as a result, his estimate is closer to the true number of Americans infected by the human immunodeficiency &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; which causes AIDS. ``The actual number of people carrying the HIV &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; in the United States (at the end of 1987) was not the 900,000 to 1.4 million the official sources estimate, but probably more than twice that number,\\'\\' the Hudson report said. ``There were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the AIDS virus, with the most likely total of infections probably close to 2.4 million,\\'\\' the report said. Dr. Timothy Dondero, chief of a CDC branch studying the spread of AIDS, quickly disputed the claim, however. In a telephone interview from the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Dondero said he and his staff reviewed the Hudson &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; and the methods used and said, ``We do not feel a change in our data is appropriate.\\'\\' He said that for the Hudson model to be correct, about 2 percent of the young adult population in the United States would have to be infected with HIV. Yet, he said, ``their figures are inconsistently high within segments of populations for which there are test results.\\'\\' Dondero said tests from hospital patients, military recruits and prisoners show HIV infection rates of less than 1 percent _ 0.2 percent to 0.66 percent _ among young adults. Hopkins admitted, ``We\\'re all in a guessing game\\'\\' when it comes to estimating the number of people infected with the AIDS virus. Nonetheless, he said he believed the Hudson method is a more realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation. ``The CDC may be right and we may be wrong,\\'\\' Hopkins said. ``Until a national seroprevalence test is conducted, we will not know. ... The main conclusion is that we cannot be complacent about this disease.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; by Hudson, a privately financed public policy &lt;b&gt; research &lt;/b&gt; organization with headquarters in Indianapolis, used basic CDC data on the number of AIDS cases. But Hopkins said Hudson used different computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques to estimate the rate of HIV infections. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is caused by the HIV virus, is the end stage of the &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; and may not develop for years after a person is infected with the virus. But an infected person can spread the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; before developing AIDS. For this reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic. HIV infection is determined by a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; test which identifies antibodies in &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; serum. A person with such antibodies is known as seropositive. Hopkins said the Hudson &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; also estimated that the number of heterosexuals infected by the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; may be three times higher than CDC estimates. The CDC says the chief victims of AIDS, a contagious &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; that attacks the body\\'s &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system, have been homosexual men and intravenous &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; users. The Hudson &lt;b&gt; study &lt;/b&gt; estimates that of the 850,000 to 1.4 million heterosexuals infected with the HIV virus, between 200,000 and 500,000 are those who do not use drugs. ``There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,\\'\\' said Hopkins. ``A breakout into the non-monogamous population is unavoidable.\\'\\' The CDC has estimated that the AIDS &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; has infected only 80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population. The Hudson report said about 118,000 of the heterosexuals infected are ``mainstream\\'\\' population members. ``They are not poor, and they are not IV &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; users,\\'\\' Hudson said. ``But they are nonetheless carriers of the &lt;b&gt; virus &lt;/b&gt; and, through their sexual contacts, can proceed to spread the &lt;b&gt; disease &lt;/b&gt; to others of their same class.\\'\\' The CDC says that as of Aug. 15, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,702 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,898, have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. &lt;/p&gt; 0.621781836027599  \\n   Mice prone to developing a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; gained partial protection from a human gene that influences &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell development, suggesting that developmental genes may affect vulnerability to cancer, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; say. Such genes may make a difference in how long normal cells remain susceptible to turning malignant, they said. The work is reported in Thursday\\'s issue of the British journal Nature by Philip Leder, Michel Nussenzweig and Emmett Schmidt of Harvard Medical School with colleagues there and at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. They worked with mice that carried a human c-myc gene, which puts them at high risk for developing a &lt;b&gt; blood &lt;/b&gt; cell &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; called pre-B cell lymphoma. Pre-B cells are those that will develop as B cells, an important part of the body\\'s disease-fighting &lt;b&gt; immune &lt;/b&gt; system. Those mice were bred with others that carried a different human gene, one that makes B cells skip an early stage in their development. Some progeny from these matings inherited both human genes, and their lymphoma rates were compared to those that carried only the cancer-causing gene. Results showed that the gene that speeds development caused both a delay and a reduction in the tumors, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; said. By 117 days of age, half the mice that carried only the cancer-causing gene had developed lymphoma, but none of the mice with both genes had developed it. After a year, more than 90 percent of the first group had developed tumors, compared to only 40 percent of the mice with both human genes. The developmental gene apparently hampered development of &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; by speeding up the maturation of pre-B cells, leaving fewer at stages most susceptible to the cancer-causing gene, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; suggested. In general, a diverse group of genes that produce either an acceleration or pause in cell development may influence the rates and time of onset for cancer, &lt;b&gt; researchers &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.615171713382808  \\n   A panel of experts says removing a cancerous tumor in the early stages of breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; gives as good a survival chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast is removed. Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give ``excellent\\'\\' results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the panel said. The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the National Institutes of Health to consider &lt;b&gt; research &lt;/b&gt; on the survival of women with early stages of breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; and to develop a consensus on what therapy should be used to treat the disease. ``The therapies appear to be equivalent in survival,\\'\\' said Dr. William C. Wood, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and chairman of the committee. ``We believe it is preferable to preserve an organ.\\'\\' Mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early stage breast cancer, Wood said. A lumpectomy is followed with radiation therapy, and Wood said some &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; choose mastectomy because they ``prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of radiation therapy.\\'\\' In its report, the committee said surgery in which the breast is saved, or conserved, ``is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer, and is preferable\\'\\' because the breast is preserved and the survival chances are the same as for mastectomy. Wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the removal of nearby lymph nodes. If these nodes are cancer-free and the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter, both methods of &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; have about a 90 percent chance of cure. About 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; this year, the committee report said. Between 75 percent and 80 percent of this group will have Stage I or Stage II disease, and about two-thirds of these will have cancer-free lymph nodes. Stage I and II cancers have not spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes. But just how to treat this early-stage breast &lt;b&gt; cancer &lt;/b&gt; long has been controversial. Traditionally, the preferred &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; has been a radical mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is removed. During the past two decades, there have been a number of studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast surgery, including lumpectomy. The committee found that, based on the studies, survival rates are virtually the same for the two types of therapy. The experts said the picture was less clear for follow-up &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/b&gt; using chemotherapy or a &lt;b&gt; drug &lt;/b&gt; that blocks the hormone estrogen. The studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy, but the committee said the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patient\\'s quality of life. For &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; with very small primary tumors _ one centimeter or less _ adjuvant therapy is not required, the committee said. The committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full understanding by the patient of all the options. Lumpectomies are not appropriate for all Stage I or II &lt;b&gt; patients &lt;/b&gt; because of the size of the breast, or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps within the breast, the committee said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  black city mayor white barry community blacks council memorial city\\'s moore racial jackson whites koch rights robinson civil members rev &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.374482495957865  \\n   Marion Barry\\'s lawyer is portraying Rasheeda Moore as a vengeful ex-lover who trapped the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; in an FBI sting operation because he had abandoned her for another woman.

Midway through the FBI videotape in which Barry ultimately smoked crack cocaine, Moore asked the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; if he wants to use drugs. ``No, not tonight,\\'\\' Barry replied in the tape, which was played in court Thursday. ``You felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade, influence, coerce or beguile\\'\\' Barry into using drugs, Mundy asked Moore. ``I did,\\'\\' she replied. ``Why did you do that?\\'\\' the lawyer asked. ``Just in the gist of the evening,\\'\\' said Moore, who said she got ``overcarried\\'\\' in performing her duties for the FBI. ``In your zeal to get Mr. Barry,\\'\\' Mundy said accusingly. ``For all you knew, he had been off drugs since May\\'\\' 1989 when Moore moved to California. ``Not in my zeal,\\'\\' the witness insisted. ``I was not out to get Mr. Barry.\\'\\' ``What was your intent?\\'\\' Mundy asked Moore. ``Working this operation\\'\\' with the FBI, she replied. The defense lawyer suggested that Moore had been badly treated by the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; and motivated by revenge. ``Were you mad at Mr. Barry because he didn\\'t return your calls\\'\\' throughout an eight-month span in 1989, Mundy asked. ``No, I wasn\\'t,\\'\\' Moore replied. She also denied that she was angry because the married &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; was involved with another woman, Maria McCarthy, or because he had slapped her when they broke up their romantic relationship. Had Moore been scorned? a reporter asked Mundy after the day\\'s court session. ``A woman scorned,\\'\\' Mundy agreed immediately. ``Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\\'\\' McCarthy was jailed for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury looking into the mayor\\'s alleged drug use. She later relented and is now listed as a possible witness at Barry\\'s trial. Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. One of the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation. Meanwhile Friday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, presiding in the Barry case, barred &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; activist clergyman George Augustus Stallings, a Barry supporter, from attending the trial. Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest, broke with the Vatican by starting his own African-American church. Mundy and the American Civil Liberties Union said they were asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn Jackson\\'s decision regarding Stallings as well as his order Thursday barring Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Jackson said Stallings\\' and Farrakhan\\'s presence in the courtroom would be potentially disruptive. Barry told reporters he could ``not understand why any citizen\\'\\' who wanted to use one of the four courtroom passes provided to the defense cannot do so. ``So I think that we are in a totalitarian situation where Bishop Stallings or Minister Farrakhan (cannot attend.),\\'\\' Barry said. ``It\\'s like in Nazi Germany.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.364913244447588  \\n   Beneath a naked bluff on a mile-long Boston Harbor island known chiefly for its antiquated jail lie the unmarked graves of about 4,100 early immigrants whose American dreams ended in death. Most were famine-weakened Irish who fled their starving country in the mid-1800s only to be deemed ``undesirable\\'\\' and detained on Deer Island, where they died and until now were largely forgotten. ``They symbolize all immigrants that have come to Boston and to America,\\'\\' Mayor Raymond Flynn said this week. ``They may have been poor, probably didn\\'t have any family and weren\\'t among the elite. ``But still every respect should be afforded to their memory.\\'\\' Residents of Boston, home to more Irish-Americans per capita than any other U.S. city, are resurrecting the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; missing chapter. Deer Island\\'s low-security jail is scheduled to close in 1991 and local business, labor and other groups plan to have the gravesite landscaped by 1995, the 150th anniversary year of the potato famine. The &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; has announced plans to erect a Celtic cross on the island and a statue near Fanueil Hall as part of the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; ``Great Hunger Memorial Project,\\'\\' the nation\\'s first &lt;b&gt; memorial &lt;/b&gt; to Irish famine victims _ and victims of hunger around the world. The graves on the island about four miles from Boston\\'s wharves came to Flynn\\'s attention several months ago, after construction workers turned up bones at a new sewage treatment plant site. ``You think of them getting this far, coming across the Atlantic and being able to look over and see the &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; ... only to end up in an anonymous pauper\\'s grave,\\'\\' said Francis J. Costello, the mayor\\'s adviser on Irish-American Affairs. ``We have to put a proper finish on this.\\'\\' Many of the thousands of immigrants held on Deer Island eventually made it to a new life on the mainland. But thousands more were buried in shallow, lime-lined trenches that held eight or 10 bodies each. Their anonymous graves tell the story of immigrants who saw but never reached America\\'s shores. Ireland\\'s population of 8 million was cut in half by fatal disease, starvation and emigration after a devastating plant disease hit the country\\'s staple potato crop in 1845. During the next 10 years, more than 152,000 Irish fled to Boston, many of them tenant farmers forced to move on when they no longer could afford to pay rent. The Yankees were unprepared for the influx of penniless, weak and diseased immigrants, many of whom were near death after a month or more aboard the crowded ``coffin ships\\'\\' they had taken across the Atlantic. ``As a precautionary measure to ward off a pestilence that would have been ruinous to the public health and business of the city,\\'\\' a quarantine hospital was established on Deer Island, according to a Massachusetts Senate document dated 1848. Paupers and inmates also were held on the island because officials deemed them, like the Irish and a fraction of immigrants from other countries, ``undesirable within the core urban area,\\'\\' according to &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; documents. ``It was really a human dump heap,\\'\\' said Dennis P. Ryan, author of ``Beyond The Ballot: A Social History of the Boston Irish.\\'\\' Several rough-hewn wooden crosses stood for years on the bluff near the graves, but by about 1970 they had disappeared or disintegrated. A lone &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; Celtic cross also was erected amid the yellow rapeseed, but that too is gone. ``It wasn\\'t a deep dark secret,\\'\\' said Deborah Cox, president of the Public Archaeology Laboratory Inc. in Pawtucket, R.I. ``I think it was just one of those things people don\\'t pay attention to and then eventually forget,\\'\\' said Cox, whose company surveyed Deer Island before construction began on the new sewage treatment plant in late 1988. Boston\\'s archivist, Edward Quill, has begun researching death records and handwritten weekly logs kept by physicians at Deer Island\\'s quarantine hospital. For years the records have gathered dust, now they\\'ll be available to genealogists and other researchers. Several Flynns have turned up among the 872 names Quill has traced. ``It could well have been any immigrant group that has come to our country,\\'\\' said Mayor Flynn. ``That\\'s why we need a symbol, a decent resting place ... so their history won\\'t be forgotten.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.352500052649356  \\n   The cocaine and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry has focused attention on race relations in the nation\\'s capital, a &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; with a 70 percent &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; population and little recent history of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; strife. ``I think that there is a perception with a substantial number of the population that he is being picked on unfairly,\\'\\' said Kenneth Robinson, a local attorney who consulted with Barry\\'s counsel. Robinson is white. ``I think the Barry trial is just another indication that people are very, very sensitive to race and how people are treated,\\'\\' said Ethelbert Miller, a poet who teaches at Howard University. Miller is black. A U.S. District Court jury began deliberating the Barry case Thursday afternoon. Two members, both men, are white. One of them has been chosen jury foreman. Barry admits that the trial has brought to the surface ``a simmering amount of polarization and racism that was already there.\\'\\' Some &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; agree with Barry\\'s claim that he was the target of overzealous &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; prosecutors. Others feel betrayed by the mayor, who had claimed repeatedly that he didn\\'t use drugs. ``The majority of &lt;b&gt; whites &lt;/b&gt; are just plain annoyed and angry and just want this guy to go,\\'\\' D.C. Councilman Jim Nathanson said before the trial began. Nathanson, who is white, represents a predominantly &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; district. For all the talk about &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; polarization, Barry is the one who was often credited with cooling the tempers that erupted after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Ten people died, 1,191 were reported injured and 7,650 were arrested in the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; worst riots. Washington was then 63 percent black. Some &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; leaders, Jesse L. Jackson among them, have suggested that the climate exists for a resurgence of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; violence in Washington if Barry is convicted. Barry himself said it will not. ``Those who would even talk about that don\\'t represent me, don\\'t represent what I stand for,\\'\\' he told reporters last week. ``You obviously don\\'t realize that we have grown as a people the last 20 years. We will not destroy that which we have worked so hard to build up.\\'\\' ``To equate this to the violence that would occur when a &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; man killed Martin Luther King is asinine,\\'\\' Robinson said. ``People will talk about it in bars and on the street, but I just don\\'t believe that it is going to happen.\\'\\' ``Some of the noise that you hear is sort of par for the course,\\'\\' said Sam Smith, the &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; publisher of the Progressive Review, a Washington opinion journal. ``It\\'s just that more people are paying attention to it now.\\'\\' The presiding judge in the trial, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is white. One of the prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin, is white. The other, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts, is black. Barry\\'s lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, is black. Barry has called the case ``a political lynching\\'\\' and a case of ``satanic, dirt-like tactics.\\'\\' Jackson called it part of an ``ugly pattern\\'\\' of ``white judicial leadership attacking &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; political leadership.\\'\\' NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks voiced a similar complaint. U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said he believes in trying cases ``regardless of who the person is or what the political priorities are.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; and his allies have also sharply criticized news media coverage of the case. Abdul Alim Muhammad, a Muslim who is running for Congress in suburban Prince George\\'s County, Md., said, ``What we are witnessing in D.C. is like an electronic lynching. In some respects, the media are no better than the red-necked tobacco chewing &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of the Ku Klux Klan.\\'\\' Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, has shown his support for Barry by attending the trial despite efforts by the judge to have him barred as ``potentially disruptive.\\'\\' Barry, who broke into politics as a street organizer in the &lt;b&gt; civil &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; movement, has been &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; for 12 years. He is not seeking re-election, and six candidates are running to succeed him. When one of them, City Council Chairman David Clarke, was introduced at a rally for &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; South African leader Nelson Mandela, he was booed by &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of the mostly &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; audience. Clarke is white. Although he still has a loyal following, especially among poor blacks, Barry is increasingly viewed as an embarrassment by &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of Washington\\'s large &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; middle class. Long-time &lt;b&gt; civil &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; advocate and educator Roger Wilkins, a past political supporter of the mayor, wrote recently in The Washington Post: ``Marion Barry used the elders and lied to the young. He has manipulated thousands of others with his cynical use of charges of racism to defend his malodorous personal failures.\\'\\' Robert Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, said Barry ``has certainly created a &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; situation out of something that I do not think was. He is exploiting tensions and in some cases creating tensions that otherwise would not have existed.\\'\\' Woodson, who is black, was a member of a White House &lt;b&gt; council &lt;/b&gt; on private sector initiatives in the Reagan administration. The Rev. James Bevel, a Barry supporter who conducted prayer meetings in a tent outside the courthouse through much of the trial, said; ``It is not affecting basic race relationships or hostilities in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; folks toward &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; people. I don\\'t see that in the people I\\'m around.\\'\\' The Rev. A. Knighton Stanley, the &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; pastor of People\\'s Congregational Church, said he avoids raising the issue of possible violence. ``Am I uneasy? My answer is yes,\\'\\' said Stanley. ``My judgment is we will not have it, and my prayer is that my judgment is right.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.325951367562285  \\n   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he stands by his criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson before New York\\'s Democratic primary, but says he regrets that his belligerent style and sharply worded attacks offended Jackson\\'s supporters. In a statement released hours after Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called on the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; to apologize for his ``divisive\\'\\' remarks, Koch said he had ``articulated my concerns in a way that, regrettably, offended a large number of people, both &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; and white.\\'\\' ``I would hope they will look beyond my style to the substance of what I said, which I believe was fair political criticism. ``The words I used were too sharp. These are words I have used for years. Because of the particular sensitivity of this situation, I should have been more careful in my choice of words.\\'\\' It was highly unusual for Ward _ the &lt;b&gt; city\\'s &lt;/b&gt; first &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; police commissioner and a Koch appointee _ to comment on political matters that did not directly involve the police department, but he said he felt the need to do so because he was being asked regularly about Koch\\'s anti-Jackson efforts. In a letter that appeared in today\\'s editions of The New York Times, Koch said, ``It was never my intent to draw political lines with &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; or religious borders.\\'\\' Ward said today he was ``absolutely\\'\\' satisfied that the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; never intended to insult the &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; community. Koch\\'s attacks on Jackson have brought a continued backlash and have prompted early efforts to form a coalition to defeat the &lt;b&gt; mayor &lt;/b&gt; next year, when it is expected he will seek a fourth term. When asked if Koch was apologizing to Jackson as well as his supporters, the mayor\\'s press secretary, George Arzt, responded: ``Whatever the letter says. We\\'re not going beyond it.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.319054610538338  \\n   Big Bird was there, and Fozzie Bear, and Oscar the Grouch, as more than 1,400 colleagues, family and fans paid tribute to Muppet creator Jim Henson in a verdant St. Paul\\'s Cathedral. England was a second home to Henson, who died in May at the age of 53. ``He loved England and the English; we claim him as ours,\\'\\' said Duncan Kenworthy, chief of Henson Productions in Britain. For the tribute, the cathedral was transformed to resemble a north London parkland Henson loved. The 17th-century building was festooned with greenery, its aisles full of Henson\\'s creatures and portraits of their creator. Friends and colleagues of Henson had worked into the night adorning the cathedral with garlands, plants and birches. A May 21 &lt;b&gt; memorial &lt;/b&gt; for Henson at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York included a Dixieland band and Muppets singing their way through the crowd. Henson died May 16 in New York of pneumonia. Henson\\'s family asked well-wishers not to wear black, saying the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for Henson\\'s life as a traditional &lt;b&gt; memorial &lt;/b&gt; service. ``He has left a heritage that will never be forgotten. Jim Henson will always be with us,\\'\\' said Lord Lew Grade. It was Grade who contracted Henson in 1976 to make 24 half-hour episodes of ``The Muppet Show\\'\\' after the Muppeteer failed to find American backing for the variety show. The show became one of the most widely seen television programs in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100 countries. Most of Henson\\'s films were made in Britain as well. Henson owned a home in north London\\'s leafy Hampstead district, across the street from the onetime Victorian post office housing the Creature Shop where his puppets are made. Muppet performer Richard Hunt led a quartet in a medley of Henson\\'s favorite songs. Henson\\'s wife Jane and four of his five children attended. ```When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who makes a difference in this world,\\'\\'\\' daughter Cheryl, 29, recited from an essay written by her father. ```My hope still is to leave this world a little bit better than it was when I got here.\\'\\'\\' ``We really feel he did leave the world a bit better,\\'\\' she told the congregation. ``So, thanks.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  attorney meese general justice reed sources edwin investigation thornburgh board wallach criminal wedtech meese\\'s pipeline warmus peres iii independent chinn &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.502293898442515  \\n   After 10 months, one of the many unanswered questions in the &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Attorney General Edwin Meese III is whether he benefited financially from his efforts on behalf of an Iraqi oil &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; project or scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; familiar with the probe say. Last May 11, &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel James McKay launched his inquiry of Meese\\'s assistance to Wedtech and the probe has spread to the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s involvement with the pipeline. In both instances, McKay\\'s investigators have been examining stock trades made on Meese\\'s behalf by his investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn. Chinn and Meese were brought together by Meese\\'s longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, a central figure in both the Wedtech scandal and the &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; project. It was disclosed earlier this month that: _In connection with the $1 billion proposed pipeline, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport paid $150,000 to his &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; Wallach, who directed the funds to an account owned by Chinn. Rappaport was a partner in the project with San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc., which was going to build the pipeline. Rappaport was brought into the deal in 1985 primarily because of his close ties to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. _The money from the Meese Partners account, Wallach\\'s $150,000 placed in the Chinn account and several hundred thousand dollars from Chinn\\'s biggest customer, Marymount College of Palos Verdes, Calif., were used as capital by Chinn to buy hard-to-get, brand-new stock issues, which Chinn sold later the same day. It would have been difficult for Chinn to obtain such stock with Meese\\'s money alone. ``Without using the holdings of the other accounts he controlled, ... Mr. Chinn may not have been able to conduct the number of trades he did ... on behalf of Meese Partners,\\'\\' a congressional subcommittee said in a report this month. _Once the stock was sold and the profit and loss determined, Chinn assigned profits and losses to his various customers. Overall, Meese invested $50,000 and came away 18 months later with $95,000, almost all of it gained through a total of 23 one-day stock trades. Eighteen of the trades were profitable. In seven of the trades, the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; didn\\'t have enough money in his account to generate the profits and losses that were assigned him. Chinn\\'s biggest customer, Marymount College, didn\\'t fare nearly as well as Meese. Was the stock trading actually a well-disguised payoff to Meese? That question is one that McKay\\'s office has been unable to resolve, say the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Central to the &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; is whether there was a plan to steer the proceeds of Chinn\\'s stock transactions to Meese and whether the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; knew about it. The &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; says he knew nothing about the transactions because he had set up a limited blind partnership with Chinn\\'s company under which details were to be kept secret from Meese as a way to protect the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; from violating rules against conflict of interest. The investigators face a wall of silence from the others involved in setting up the financial arrangements, Chinn and Wallach, who are both under indictment for racketeering in the Wedtech scandal. Wallach denied to McKay\\'s investigators that he gave anything of value to Meese, but Wallach refused to tell McKay anything about his dealings with Wedtech, his knowledge of the Meese-Chinn partnership and his dealings with Chinn. McKay said that after the Wedtech trial expected later this year of Wallach, Chinn and business associate R. Kent London, the &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel may seek their testimony again. The &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s good fortune in stock trading began months after he smoothed the way for Wallach to discuss the &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; with then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who met with Wallach and Rappaport in June 1985. Later in the year, Meese and Wallach met with Peres about the pipeline, which was never built. Also during the period the stock trading was taking place, Chinn sat on the &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors of Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor that allegedly paid out millions of dollars to lawyers and lobbyists in an attempt to influence various public officials, including Meese, in the awarding of federal contracts. One of those lawyers was Wallach, who was paid $1.3 million from 1981 through 1986 by Wedtech. The stock trades that made profits for the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; took place some four years after Meese, then White House counselor, arranged for his deputy, James Jenkins, to intervene on behalf of Wedtech in connection with a $32 million no-bid contract to build small engines for the Army. Despite the misgivings of Army officials over what they regarded as a high price, Wedtech was awarded the contract following a White House meeting called by Jenkins. Meese ended the financial arrangement with Chinn last year after the investment adviser came under &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; in the Wedtech scandal and after public disclosure that Chinn had sat on Wedtech\\'s &lt;b&gt; board &lt;/b&gt; of directors. &lt;/p&gt; 0.444618248789634  \\n   Attorney General Edwin Meese\\'s wife, Ursula, will undergo questioning shortly in the &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of her husband about her own $40,000-a-year job, say &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; familiar with the case. The office of &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel James McKay is trying to determine whether longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach in effect helped supplement the Meeses\\' income by recommending Mrs. Meese for jobs, said &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; familiar with the probe, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mrs. Meese has retained the same Washington law firm representing her husband, said James Rocap, one of Meese\\'s lawyers. She will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be questioned by investigators from McKay\\'s office. McKay said last week that his &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese, also encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Meese\\'s job, would continue at least until the end of April. McKay last month subpoenaed records relating to Mrs. Meese\\'s post with the Washington chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, said a lawyer for the chapter, James Bierbower. A lawyer for Wallach, George Walker, has told The Washington Post that Wallach had suggested Mrs. Meese for a job with a local radio station owned by the Bender family of Washington. Mrs. Meese took the position with the MS Society instead. However, Bierbower said the Bender Foundation of Washington, controlled by the same family that owns the radio station, is contributing the $40,000 a year that constitutes Mrs. Meese\\'s salary with the MS group. Calls to the Bender Foundation seeking its reasons for paying Mrs. Meese\\'s salary were not returned. Mrs. Meese has been a volunteer for the MS Society since 1981 and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called Operation Job Match, matching MS victims with employers. Mrs. Meese also was questioned in an earlier &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel\\'s &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese in 1984. In that investigation, &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel Jacob Stein probed Meese\\'s failure to include in his financial disclosure statements a $15,000 loan by Edwin Thomas to Mrs. Meese. Thomas later became Meese\\'s assistant counselor at the White House. The &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel found no connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by Thomas, his wife and his son. In another development Monday, Justice Department &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; said Meese will face an ethics &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; by his own department\\'s Office of Professional Responsibility if McKay doesn\\'t seek an indictment. Such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a recommendation to President Reagan that Meese be fired. Former Assistant Attorney General William Weld\\'s files on the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s dealings with Wallach were moved to OPR last Friday, the &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; said. Material collected by Weld\\'s &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; division last year led to McKay\\'s &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese. McKay said Friday he has insufficient evidence to date to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his involvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; touted by Wallach or his involvement with the regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he held $14,000 in Baby Bell stock. In December, McKay said he didn\\'t have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. McKay said that if he decides not to seek a &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; indictment of Meese, the &lt;b&gt; independent &lt;/b&gt; counsel\\'s office ``will refer all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate administrative authorities,\\'\\' a reference to OPR. OPR\\'s chief, Michael Shaheen, denied assertions by Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, that his office had begun examining Meese\\'s ties to longtime friend Wallach last year. That review was halted when McKay launched his &lt;b&gt; criminal &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; investigation &lt;/b&gt; of Meese last May 11, the &lt;b&gt; sources &lt;/b&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.380476725806409  \\n   A top aide to Attorney General Edwin Meese III says a recent congressional report accusing his boss of violating White House ethics rules should top a ``list of sleaze.\\'\\' Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who last year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to Meese, said the bipartisan Senate report is harmful to ongoing inquiries into the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s actions. ``We\\'ve got a process that\\'s in place, people who are investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are,\\'\\' Reynolds said on CBS-TV\\'s ``Face the Nation\\'\\' program. ``If that is the best case that one comes up with against this &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; for ethical conduct, I would have to say that this man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect.\\'\\' Reynolds, the top enforcer of the Reagan administration\\'s civil rights policies, added: ``If I were making a list of sleaze, I\\'d put that (the report) at the top.\\'\\' The report, issued Wednesday by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management, concluded that Meese\\'s violation of the rules resulted in ``improper favoritism\\'\\' for the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. The report said E. Robert Wallach sent Meese, then counselor to President Reagan, 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing Wedtech\\'s efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the Army and government officials\\' opposition to those efforts. Meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of Wedtech, but says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair hearing. Wallach, a longtime friend of Meese, is now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal. He was paid $1.3 million by the Bronx, N.Y.-company, which subsequently won the no-bid, $32 million contract. ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House policy on contracts with procurement officials, which failure resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,\\'\\' the report said. The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981 says that ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or business associate has a financial interest.\\'\\' Reynolds said the report ``made reference to a policy or rule in the White House that wasn\\'t in existence at the time the Wedtech thing was referred over to the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general.\\'\\' Independent Counsel James McKay has been investigating Meese\\'s ties to Wedtech, a $1 billion Iraqi &lt;b&gt; pipeline &lt;/b&gt; project promoted by Wallach, and other matters. In addition, the Office of Government Ethics is conducting an inquiry into why Meese solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessman to pay more than $3,000 apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference. Reynolds maintained that despite the investigations, morale at the Justice Department remains good. ``Actually, it\\'s very good,\\'\\' he said. ``We have a lot of professionals. Everybody in the department is very professional. ``Most of the people in the department take the attitude that is much the same as George Bush\\'s attitude. These are investigations that are ongoing. They\\'ll play themselves out, the process ought to be allowed to work,\\'\\' Reynolds said. ``So far,\\'\\' he added, ``nobody has suggested that the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; has done anything that comes close to unlawful activity or activity that is going to result in an indictment of any kind.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.369864663869631  \\n   Here is a chronology of major developments in the story involving Attorney General Edwin Meese\\'s wife, Ursula, and the Bender real estate transaction. Aug. 8, 1984: Congress approves a Reagan administration plan to move some Justice Department workers from the Chester Arthur Building and to give up 37 percent of its space when the lease expires in March 1986. March 1, 1985: Howard Bender, a Washington real estate developer, heads a partnership which completes purchase of the Chester Arthur Building for $37.5 million, nearly twice the assessed value and three times its purchase price about five years earlier. June 6, 1985: The administration notifies Congress the Justice Department intends to stay in the Chester Arthur Building, instead of moving out some employees. June 1985: Officials of the Justice Department\\'s Immigration and Naturalization Service, the major tenant in the building, forward complaints to the General Services Administration _ the government\\'s housekeeper _ that the building\\'s air system is causing illness among workers. Fall 1985: Officials at WWDC, a rock-and-roll radio station owned by the Bender family, offer Attorney General Edwin Meese\\'s wife, Ursula, a position as a public affairs commentator. She declines the offer. Sept. 26, 1985: Assistant immigration commissioner James Kennedy formally requests an environmental inspection of the air system at Chester Arthur. October 1985: The Bender Foundation, a family-owned philanthropy, makes known that it is willing to donate money to pay Ursula Meese as a development director of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, where she has been a volunteer. Howard Bender\\'s wife, Sondra, is president of the foundation and serves on the MS society board. Jan. 1, 1986: Mrs. Meese begins a $40,000-a-year job, under the Bender Foundation\\'s three-year grant. July 2, 1986: Environmental inspectors report ``many offices in the Chester Arthur Building which exhibited high complaint rates and above-average sick leave occurences contained viable aero-allergens in concentrations which could easily produce these effects.\\'\\' May 14, 1987: The GSA signs a $50 million, 10-year lease for Justice Department workers to stay in the Chester Arthur Building after the Bender partnership promises to clean the air system. The rent jumps more than three-fold. May 27, 1987: The partnership headed by Howard Bender sells the Chester Arthur Building for $60.1 million cash _ a $22.7 million profit over two years _ to an Illinois-based partnership. &lt;/p&gt; 0.366105433666985  \\n   July 8 The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on the resignation of Attorney General Meese: The last crony is leaving. Months, even years after propriety demanded it, Ed Meese says he\\'ll resign _ sometime. Whatever conservative legacy he left the Justice Department and the courts is overshadowed by his cheapening of the office of &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; and the chaos now paralyzing Justice. ... Meese has managed to slip through the net in four investigations, because the evidence against him always was circumstantial. It just happened that cronies who did favors for Meese soon ended up with lucrative government contracts, or federal jobs or other special favors. The best Meese\\'s investigators could find was impropriety, not illegality. Yet the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; took the lack of charges as a ringing endorsement of his innocence. ... Meese is a deal-maker, a hustler. He never understood that the &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; can\\'t use his office to create a personal pork barrel. ... Does Meese leave any legacy except sleaze? ... He tried to weaken the Miranda Rule and abortion rights before a Supreme Court that was prepared to do neither. He embarked on an anti-pornography crusade, an odd priority for someone whose mission also includes fighting organized crime. He botched the early stages of the Iran-Contra probe, perhaps deliberately. Yet, Meese has shown one thing. An &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; general\\'s politics are not as important as his credibility, his honesty and his ability to lead. After three years with a laughingstock for a leader, Justice needs an &lt;b&gt; attorney &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; of high personal reputation. But the department must wait for the next administration to provide one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  british french france britain london paris mrs thatcher prime european minister union sweden margaret europe germany community britain\\'s australia major &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.507765602073666  \\n   Garri Kasparov of the Soviet Union moved into first place Sunday in the World Cup Chess Championship with a 10th round victory over Ulf Andersson of Sweden.

The decision by the 12 EC nations gives jobless nationals in the European Community the same rights as wage-earners. An elderly citizen who has dreamed of retiring in sunnier southern climates will be able to obtain a five-year, renewable residency permit in the EC country of his choice. The retiree must show only proof of health insurance and that he or she will not burden the adopted nation\\'s social security system. And a student who can show proof of registration at a university or college in another EC nation as well as sufficient income will receive a one-year renewable residency permit. Those who are unemployed by choice and do not classify as being either elderly or a student will have to prove they have sufficient income not to need assistance from the social security system in their new country. The 12 EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. In 1992, the nations will drop trade barriers among themselves to create a unified Euromarket. In Brussels Wednesday the 18 nations of Western Europe\\'s two trading blocs began talks to pave the way for the so-called European Economic Space. The move would bring the six nations of the European Free Trade Association _ Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland _ closer to the European Community. Frans Andriessen, an EC commissioner, said he hoped broad agreement would be reached near the end of this year and be fully implemented on Jan. 1, 1993, when the EC\\'s single market comes into force. &lt;/p&gt; 0.317949177023953  \\n   Luxembourg takes over the European Community\\'s presidency on Tuesday, with war looming in the Persian Gulf, world trade talks in disarray and Europe in full transformation. The Grand Duchy, a tiny speck on the map with only about 0.1 percent of the population in the 12-nation community, has a good track record in handling the rotating six-month EC presidencies. Jacques Santer, &lt;b&gt; prime &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; minister &lt;/b&gt; of the 378,400 Luxembourgers, is convinced the mouse will roar again when his country takes over the community\\'s presidency from Italy as 1991 begins. ``During all of our presidencies we always came up with results,\\'\\' Santer said in a recent interview. Five years ago, the Luxembourg presidency paved the way for the Single European Act, an updated constitution that pushes the trade bloc toward creating a truly unified market after 1992. This time around, new initiatives to create economic, monetary and political &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; by the turn of the century have been thrust into Santer\\'s lap. The Christian Democrat plans to act as a mediator between the EC\\'s powerhouses - Germany, France and Britain - to finalize the blueprint for European unity. ``Because we are so small, the others do not suspect us of having ulterior self-serving motives,\\'\\' he said. Shoehorned between Germany, France and Belgium, Luxembourg occupies a key crossroads on the continent, straddling Europe\\'s main cultures - the Romanic and Germanic. It is also well-connected with both the rich north and poor south in the community. The Persian Gulf crisis might prove the first test of Luxembourg\\'s mettle. The EC has said it would not hold talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz unless the United States first reaches agreement with Iraq on exchanging foreign ministers\\' visits. If the EC agrees to talk with Iraq, that task would fall to Luxembourg\\'s Foreign Minister Jacques Poos. During Luxembourg\\'s six months, a lot of energy will be spent on two conferences - one on economic and monetary union, the other on political &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; -to pave the way for a more unified Europe. Disarray reigns on how fast monetary &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; should be achieved, Santer said. He said calls for an independent EC defense organization are not realistic and it remains ``essential that we keep a partnership with the United States\\'\\' within NATO - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The partnership with Washington has been strained in global trade, where the EC has resisted U.S. proposals that it reduce price supports and subsidies for farmers. The agricultural dispute blocked an agreement in world trade talks held in Brussels, Belgium earlier this month. The talks are to resume in Geneva next month. Santer, stressing the progress that has been made in the other 14 sectors covered by the trade talks, said farming should not block an overall accord. He argued in favor of a final deal that, if need be, excludes agriculture. &lt;/p&gt; 0.312941082165462  \\n   Britain\\'s beleaguered trade secretary, Nicholas Ridley, came home Friday night from a trade visit to Hungary and expectations were he will resign after his charge that West Germany wanted to take over a united Europe. His comments in a magazine interview, which he later retracted, provoked cross-party calls for his resignation and were denounced in Germany, France and other European countries. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused Friday to answer questions about Ridley\\'s political future, reportedly leaving the first move up to him. But even rank-and-file members of her Conservative Party, who applaud his warning of German supremacy over a united Europe, said he will have to go. Sir Marcus Fox, vice chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory lawmakers, told BBC Radio 4 that Ridley\\'s position was now ``very bad.\\'\\' Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons on Thursday that Ridley was not reflecting government policy, nor her own views, but she rejected demands for his dismissal. Ridley, 61, the outspoken and controversial son of Viscount Ridley, is considered Mrs. Thatcher\\'s closest ideological ally in the Cabinet. Political commentators said his departure would be a blow to her. In the interview with the conservative weekly, the Spectator, Ridley said the West German government\\'s support for European monetary &lt;b&gt; union &lt;/b&gt; ``is all a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to be thwarted. ``This rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely intolerable.\\'\\' Ridley said he opposed yielding sovereignty to the 12-nation European Community, which he said was run by ``17 unelected reject politicians.\\'\\' He said: ``You might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly.\\'\\' Earlier Friday night, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd made the government\\'s first move to repair the damage to Anglo-European relations. Speaking at the Anglo-American conference center near Oxford, Hurd said: ``Our alliance, our partnership and our friendship with France and Germany lie at the heart of modern British foreign policy. ``Lingering memories from the past do not prevent us from strengthening, month by month, the practical proofs of that friendship. ``Irreversible also is the steadily increasing cooperation with the fellow members and institutions of the European Community of which the &lt;b&gt; prime &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; minister &lt;/b&gt; spoke after the Dublin (EEC) summit (last month). ``Nothing will now put these processes in doubt.\\'\\' Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Liberal Democratic Party, said: ``The issue has now become not Mr. Ridley\\'s folly but Mrs. Thatcher\\'s judgment. By refusing to sack him, she is multiplying the insult of his outrageous views.\\'\\' Gordon Brown, the opposition Labor Party\\'s trade spokesman, said she was guilty of a ``dismal failure of leadership\\'\\' for leaving the decision about Ridley\\'s future in his hands. ``With this indecision following on top of the Ridley insults, her inaction today signifies an astonishing abdication of responsibility that will make Britain the subject of, at best, ridicule, and at worst, hostility throughout Europe,\\'\\' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  club animals species members animal endangered wild hunter metropolitan quayle habitat wildlife elephants golf natural skins thailand order membership club\\'s &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.480141393583948  \\n   The owner of two Indian &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; says he\\'ll agree to sell the 3{-ton &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; if their former owner, who apparently has been hiding the pachyderms for four years, will return them. Richard Drake, owner of a now-closed Tehachapi, Calif., &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; farm, said Sunday he wants to get fair market value for the 27-year-old female elephants, appraised at $70,000 apiece. Drake said he has spent ``thousands and thousands of dollars\\'\\' crisscrossing the country searching for Arlan Seidon, the man who fled with the elephants, Tory and Duchess. Seidon, who raised the elphants from infancy, contacted The Star Ledger of Newark several weeks ago from an undisclosed location and said he would return to face charges of third-degree theft if the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; were not given to Drake. Seidon sold the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; to the Drakes for $80,000 in 1981 but said he repossessed the &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; for non-payment. The Drakes successfully fought the action and in May 1984 Superior Court Judge Peter Thomas awarded them $107,000 in damages. Seidon also charged that Drake, 50, and his son, Edward, 30, abused the animals. The Drakes deny that charge. Seidon, 58, fled with the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; from a farm in Colts Neck Township while the &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; were with a circus in New Jersey. He has been on the lam ever since. ``It\\'s been at a standstill for four years,\\'\\' Drake said from his sister\\'s Far Hills home. ``We have to do something.\\'\\' Drake said Sunday he had contacted Seidon\\'s attorney, Isabelle Strauss of East Orange, and was awaiting an answer to his proposal. Ms. Strauss, an &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; activist, was not in her office today for additional comment, a secretary said. She told The Star Ledger on Saturday that Seidon, who phones her periodically, would not allow the &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; to go to &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; brokers who would sell them to other people. Ms. Strauss said a Vermont businessman is interested in the &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; and that she is trying to work out a deal. Ms. Strauss has said she does not know where or how Seidon has been concealing the elephants. Seidon has said he left his farm at Fordland, Mo., and his career preparing &lt;b&gt; animals &lt;/b&gt; for circus and television appearances to care for the elephants, which eat about 200 pounds off hay a day. He said he hasn\\'t seen his four children or met his only grandson since he took off with the animals. &lt;/p&gt; 0.443985526522564  \\n   The discovery of two &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; of the daddy-longlegs insect family in Edgewood County Park may block a proposed 18-hole &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course. Both &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; are called the Edgewood Park harvestman, of Sitalcina minor. They live only in serpentine rock formations in the park\\'s hills, and several conservationists want the habitate to be preserved. ``Constructing a &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course would wipe out the whole harvestmen populations,\\'\\' said Thomas F. Briggs, a science teacher at San Francisco Lowell High School. ``These are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world,\\'\\' he added. Briggs discovered one of the &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; in 1983 and the other in 1985. Both have eight legs, and bright orange-red bodies that measure about 1 millimeter. Unlike spiders, daddy-longlegs do not spin webs. Along with Darrell Ubick, an entomologist, Briggs has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected creature, which could halt any development of their only known habitat. San Mateo County purchased the 468-acre site in 1980 from the state and has been attempting to build a &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course there for several years. ``This little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a &lt;b&gt; golf &lt;/b&gt; course,\\'\\' said Barbara Kootz of nearby San Carlos, a golfer and leader of pro-development interests in the area. &lt;/p&gt; 0.437763169939778  \\n   Endangered &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; pop up in the strangest places. Like flowerbeds. Plant-protection activists say some &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; of bulbs bought to decorate American and European gardens are being collected by the millions in the wild, threatening to wipe out those flowers in their home turf. ``The world would lose an irreplaceable treasure,\\'\\' said Marjorie Arundel of Warrenton, Va., an adviser to the Garden Club of America\\'s horticulture committee. ``They\\'re the ancestors of all of our spring bulbs today.\\'\\' Mrs. Arundel and other activists are urging American gardeners to buy only commercially propagated plants, which experts say make up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway. ``Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade, but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants,\\'\\' said Faith Campbell, director of the plant conservation program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of America, the NRDC has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to avoid most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or snowdrops, which they say are collected in the &lt;b&gt; wild &lt;/b&gt; in Turkey. Those three &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; are listed as &lt;b&gt; endangered &lt;/b&gt; in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. But this treaty _ effective in fighting trade in some &lt;b&gt; endangered &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; skins, horns and tusks _ has had little effect on the flower trade, Ms. Campbell said. Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey\\'s Mediterranean regions, forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions. The popular ``Angel\\'s Tears\\'\\' narcissus are being collected in the wild, but experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or somewhere else. Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from the &lt;b&gt; wild &lt;/b&gt; in the United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and the Soviet Union appear to be the sources for still other rare flowers. Some &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; of these plants may be produced by growers in the United States or Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check the origins as carefully as they can. This may become easier, as a result of the decision last May by the Dutch Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to require exporters to use a ``Bulbs from Wild Sources\\'\\' label to identify wild-collected plants. Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label their cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; and in 1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths. Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower trade, the action by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major impact, Ms. Campbell said. It is not binding, though, on dealers in the United States or other countries. Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall\\'s catalogs. So even if American gardeners &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; from Dutch dealers covered by the rules, they might not know they were buying wild-collected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail, labeled ``wild sources.\\'\\' ``We can just hope they won\\'t &lt;b&gt; order &lt;/b&gt; those again,\\'\\' Ms. Campbell said. ``It is a messy phasing-in.\\'\\' The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in Turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting &lt;b&gt; wild &lt;/b&gt; flowers to start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat, she said. Gardeners shouldn\\'t think they\\'re aiding nature by keeping alive a &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; that might be disappearing in its native habitat. ``We don\\'t consider that a contribution to conservation in any way,\\'\\' Ms. Campbell said. ``It\\'s not playing its role in the ecosystem in which it evolved.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.421592774982234  \\n   Entomologists say they want &lt;b&gt; endangered &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; protection for a recently rediscovered butterfly that experts believed had been extinct for more than 50 years. Paul Hammond, an Oregon State University entomologist and butterfly expert, said he rediscovered the butterflies by accident. ``In the spring of 1989 I hiked out onto a south-facing slope of a hill that had native prairie on it, and here was this very unusual kind of lupine plant with all these little blue butterflies swimming around on it. ``I knew immediately what it was,\\'\\' he said. It was Fender\\'s blue butterfly, a relic of the ice ages found only in Oregon\\'s Willamette Valley. The butterfly was last seen near the small town of Wren, west of Corvallis, in 1937. Since that find last year, several pockets of the &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; have been found in western Oregon. A petition is being prepared to ask the U.S. Fish and Wildlife to declare the butterfly a threatened &lt;b&gt; species &lt;/b&gt; under the federal Endangered Species Act. Hammond said the butterfly has a wingspan of only about 1 inch. The male is a ``brilliant, iridescent blue,\\'\\' he said. ``They really stand out. The female is a drab brown.\\'\\' The butterfly dates back more than 10,000 years, Hammond said. Surrounded by glaciers to the north and mountains to the south, east and west, the butterfly\\'s &lt;b&gt; habitat &lt;/b&gt; was limited to a small area of the Willamette Valley. &lt;/p&gt; 0.376721114005934  \\n   A zoo advocacy group is calling for an investigation into the cause of a half-dozen puncture wounds on the head and face of an elephant that injured a veterinarian who was trying to treat the wounds. ``What we\\'re talking about here is abuse,\\'\\' Sandra Keller, spokeswoman for Citizens for a Better Zoo, said Sunday. ``We have been receiving complaints about the way these &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; are being mistreated for several months.\\'\\' Veterinarian Gail Hedberg was treating an abscess on the head of a 3{-ton Asian elephant named Tinkerbelle when the &lt;b&gt; animal &lt;/b&gt; attacked her Saturday, fracturing her pelvis. Zookeepers said Tinkerbelle did a ``handstand\\'\\' on the woman. Hedberg was listed in stable condition today at San Francisco General Hospital. Some officials defended practices at the San Francisco Zoo. ``We have to use elephant hooks and other methods that may appear abusive because we\\'re not talking about puppy dogs and pussy cats here,\\'\\' said zoo director Saul Kitchener. ``How do you get a 10,000-pound elephant\\'s attention?\\'\\' Elephant keeper Michele Radovsky said beating an elephant is no different from ``people taking rolled newspapers and hitting their dog.\\'\\' But Paul Hunter, a keeper at the zoo for nine years, said the abscess on Tinkerbell\\'s head was caused by someone hitting her too hard with a hooked instrument called an ankuf or elephant hook. ``The &lt;b&gt; elephants &lt;/b&gt; get beaten up real bad, and I\\'m getting tired of it,\\'\\' said Hunter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  environmental plant waste nuclear pollution water epa energy chemical plants power industry environment garbage air area site creek company tank &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.504413804597327  \\n   Researchers have discovered small quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from Savannah Harbor about 100 miles downstream from the Savannah River Plant. Cesium 137, a radioactive isotope, was found in material taken from the harbor and dumped on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River, which forms the border with Georgia. Tests found tiny amounts of the material, insufficient to create a health hazard, The Charleston News &amp; Courier reported today. The tests were done for the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department by researchers at the University of Georgia. The wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants because of &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; quality problems believed to be caused by industrial discharges into the river, agency officials said. Cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; fission, and is generally associated with radioactive waste. It emits beta and gamma radiation, both of which can produce a variety of ill effects, depending on the dosage. Lou Gordell, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; division at the &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; plant, said he had not been informed of the study results, but acknowledged Monday that the material probably originated at the Savannah &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; plant. The complex near Aiken produces the radioactive materials plutonium and tritium for &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons. The government-owned &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed that a series of accidents at the &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; over the past 30 years went unreported to the public. Gordell said sediment tests in Savannah Harbor for a 1984 study showed traces of Cesium 137, and that recent monitoring upstream found similar traces both in the &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; and river sediment. Much of the material leaked from SRP apparatus in the 1950s, but some is the result of continued discharge into the river, Gordell said. The level of contamination is far below EPA\\'s maximum allowable level for drinking water, he said. Savannah and Beaufort-Jasper counties pump &lt;b&gt; water &lt;/b&gt; from the Savannah River for drinking water. Traces of tritium also are found in the river, but also are below the maximum allowable levels, Gordell said. Cesium 137, with a half-life of 30 years, persists in the &lt;b&gt; environment &lt;/b&gt; longer than tritium, with a half-life of 12 years. A half-life is the time it takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate. The Savannah Harbor is periodically dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain its depth for the port of Savannah. &lt;/p&gt; 0.435779215217155  \\n   A Massachusetts &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; is making money out of &lt;b&gt; garbage &lt;/b&gt; through new recycling methods for cities swimming in the refuse of a throwaway society. Public landfills are clogged with paper, glass, aluminum and plastic, and less than 10 percent of 160 million tons of &lt;b&gt; garbage &lt;/b&gt; produced yearly in the United States is recycled, according to David Spencer, president and founder of wTe Corp. in Bedford. His &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; develops methods for processing &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; to recover ferrous metal and other substances. The &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; also runs trash-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; under contract with cities, and joined with such companies as Dow Chemical Co. to develop plastics recycling technology. At a research station at the University of California at Berkeley, wTe hauls in barrels of trash to experiment with ways to separate components for recycling and &lt;b&gt; energy &lt;/b&gt; conversion. Spencer, 44, believes recycling and recovery, which is the process of extracting certain components of trash, will become increasingly important as cities run out of land to bury refuse, long the cheapest and easiest disposal method. ``Everything we manufacture in this country finds its way into the &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; stream. ... It all winds up on a trash truck,\\'\\' Spencer said in a recent interview. ``To look at the increase in garbage, just look at the GNP.\\'\\' Spencer acknowledged that recovery and recycling operations are costly for cash-strapped municipalities, which must weigh such expenses as housing for the elderly against recycling programs. It often may be less expensive in the short run to bury &lt;b&gt; garbage &lt;/b&gt; in a landfill, but in the long run ``yesterday\\'s landfill is today\\'s superfund site,\\'\\' he said. Spencer, who has degrees in metallurgy and materials science, is a Philadelphia native who, after attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, founded Waste Energy Technology Corp. in 1981. The name was changed to wTe in 1987. Now a $20 million, privately held &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; with 220 employees, wTe\\'s operations include a waste-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; and recycling facility in Akron, Ohio, waste-recovery projects in Dade County, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio, and, through a subsidiary, a polystyrene recycling project in Brooklyn, N.Y. In Bedford, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; runs the city\\'s curbside recycling program. Columbus has wTe under contract to use a magnetic process to extract ferrous metal from the city\\'s &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; stream before &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; is burned in the city\\'s incinerator. That makes the burning process less abrasive and wearing on city equipment. It also reduces the toxic level in and the amount of ash left over, said Tim Barr, deputy director of Columbus public utilities. Ray Kapper, Akron director of public services, said wTe was brought in to run the city\\'s waste-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; after problems with hazardous &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; and an explosion in which three people died. Such &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; burn &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; to produce steam and other forms of energy. Under contract with Amoco Corp., wTe developed a process for the McDonald\\'s Corp. chain to recycle polystyrene containers tossed away with half-eaten hamburgers and paper. The extracted material is turned into trays and other products for Rubbermaid Inc. Recycling methods can be environmentally benign. For example, discarded tires, long an urban eyesore, can be burned safely to create energy, Spencer says. The 300,000 to 500,000 tires discarded in Akron annually are shredded and fed into the waste-to-energy &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; during winter, when people traditionally throw out less trash but &lt;b&gt; energy &lt;/b&gt; needs are greater, he said. Spencer said his interest in recycling comes from a lifelong hatred of seeing anything go to waste. ``My mother used to get the squeak out of the pig, as they say,\\'\\' he said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.419788158052852  \\n   Radioactive gas leaked from the Connecticut Yankee &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; for 10 minutes Monday morning, but no one was injured and there was no danger to the public or employees, a spokeswoman said. The release of xenon-krypton occurred while technicians were taking a test sample, Northeast Utilities spokeswoman Barbara Luce. She said the accident did not affect operations at the plant. The spokeswoman said the release was measured as two-hundredths of a millirem, a unit used to measure radiation exposure. By comparison, she said, a diagnostic chest x-ray involves between 20 and 30 millirems of radiation. Luce also said that there are daily, planned releases of the gas of less than a millirem. The gas is produced during fission. The utility notifed state and government officials of the accident and were investigating, Luce said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.395006873442712  \\n   At least two companies hired by the Energy Department as independent investigators of &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; and safety conditions at &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; are on the payroll at facilities they investigated, government records show. Others participating in the audits had bid for Energy Department contracts at sites they investigated, although they were not yet working there. Still others, while not associated with the &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; they audited, are the Energy Department\\'s prime contractors at other &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; bomb factories. Written department guidelines for carrying out the ``independent tiger team\\'\\' investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding organizational conflicts of interest. It defines such a conflict as a situation in which a contractor ``has past, present or currently planned interests that either directly or indirectly ... may relate to the work to be performed\\'\\' and which may bias its judgment. The tiger teams were assembled by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins last summer to give an independent view of the plants\\' compliance with state and federal environmental, safety and health standards. The auditing work is meant to lay the groundwork for actions to correct unsafe and illegal practices at the plants. Virtually all 17 major weapons facilities have severe &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; problems; estimates of the cost of cleaning up production wastes are as high as $100 billion. Watkins publicly stressed the independence of the tiger teams but did not explain that many of the experts would be tied to the weapons business. The Energy Department, which owns the plants, declined to comment on whether the contractors\\' connections to the weapons &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; amount to a conflict of interest that undermines the independence of the investigations or taints the findings. Department spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said the department would prefer to use its own employees for this work, ``but we don\\'t have the people to do it.\\'\\' Each team is headed by a small number of department officials, but most of the scientific work is done by contract employees. Most have extensive backgrounds in &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; and safety matters. A review of department records as well as interviews with government and &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; officials show that of the eight weapons &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; investigations done last year, at least three involved companies that held other Energy Department contracts at the same sites or were bidding for contract work at those facilities. _The engineering and &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; consulting firm NUS Corp. of Gaithersburg, Md., was on the tiger team that investigated the Y-12 uranium processing &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; at Oak Ridge, Tenn., last fall. According to department records, NUS at the same time was working for the Oak Ridge reservation on an &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; study of its &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; and hazardous &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; management. The Y-12 &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; is one of several operations at the Oak Ridge reservation. NUS\\'s Oak Ridge contract was awarded Nov. 8, 1988, and was valued at $1.4 million. The firm also holds contracts at weapons facilities in South Carolina and Idaho. NUS spokesman Don Couchman declined to discuss any aspect of the firm\\'s work for the Energy Department. _Science Applications International Corp. of La Jolla, Calif., helped evaluate the Nevada Test Site, which conducts underground &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons tests. The &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; at the same time was working at the &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; under two Energy Department contracts with a combined value of $100 million. Most of its work is at a proposed high-level &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; waste &lt;/b&gt; dump at the &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; that was not part of the tiger team audit. _ICF Kaiser Engineers, an engineering and construction &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; based in Oakland, Calif., participated in tiger team audits at the Nevada Test Site. ICF held no Energy Department contracts at the test &lt;b&gt; site &lt;/b&gt; at the time of the investigation last November, but it was bidding for a $5 million job to help the facility\\'s prime contractor, Reynolds Electrical &amp; Engineering Co., Inc., develop and carry out an &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; cleanup program there. ICF Kaiser announced it won the contract 10 days after the on-site tiger team work ended Dec. 1. Similarly, records show the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; participated in tiger team investigations at the Fernald uranium processing &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; in Ohio and the Y-12 Oak Ridge &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; while it was a bidder for major Energy Department contracts at both sites. The contract at Oak Ridge is valued at $505 million over five years, according to Bob Lynch, deputy director of the department\\'s field office there. Marc Tipermas, executive vice president of ICF, said in a telephone interview that he saw no conflict of interest in his company\\'s involvement in the tiger team work. He said he was not sure whether, in choosing ICF for the work, the department knew or cared about the company\\'s other work at the weapons plants. ``In order to get this job done well and quickly, contractors had to be used,\\'\\' Tipermas said. ``Like many other companies, we were drafted. We were helter-skelter pulled onto these teams.\\'\\' The Energy Department has used private contractors to run the &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons &lt;b&gt; plants &lt;/b&gt; since they were built as part of the World War II Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. The contracting system has left the department with little internal expertise in this &lt;b&gt; area &lt;/b&gt; and a tendency to rely on the weapons makers to police themselves. Watkins strongly advocates hiring more federal employees with environmental, safety and health expertise to lessen the dependence on private contractors. Although the department insists that the tiger team members\\' links to the weapons &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; do not compromise their objectivity as judges of &lt;b&gt; environmental &lt;/b&gt; and safety conditions at the plants, some outside experts disagree. ``It\\'s inevitably a potential conflict when a contractor is reviewing another contractor, and the reason is that any possible criticism of one contractor might lead to future business for another contractor,\\'\\' said Donald F. Kettl, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University and author of a book on government use of contractors. Other tiger team members included companies in charge of running &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; weapons plants, though not the ones they investigated. These include EG&amp;G Inc., which is the prime contractor at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; near Denver, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory at Idaho Falls, which processes naval &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; fuels, and the Mound Laboratory near Dayton, Ohio, which makes detonators for &lt;b&gt; nuclear &lt;/b&gt; arms. Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs the Oak Ridge facilities, participated in some other audits, as did subsidiaries of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which runs several weapons sites, and Mason and Hangar Silas Mason Co., operator of the Pantex final weapons assembly &lt;b&gt; plant &lt;/b&gt; near Amarillo, Texas. &lt;/p&gt; 0.386319810983077  \\n   Initial tests by a Washington apple grower have identified an organic &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; that may serve as a substitute for Alar, which was banned as a probable carcinogen last year after a national scare. But a scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday it was too early to tell if the grower\\'s initial results will hold up, and that the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; would require at least two more years of study. Eric Curry of the USDA in Wenatchee said such testing generally requires three orchards in three locations around the state for three years. Spray-N-Grow, a Houston-based company, said initial results on an orchard owned by a Yakima-area grower found trees treated with the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; produced apples with a significant increase in uniformity of color, sweetness, firmness and harvest time over untreated apples. Bill Muskopf, president of Spray-N-Grow, said the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; ``provides the same benefits (as Alar) while remaining completely organic and totally non-toxic.\\'\\' Alar was a synthetic &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; growers used for two decades before a private consumer group issued a report last year saying consumption of apples treated with the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; increased cancer risk in children. The Environmental Protection Agency banned the &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; later in the year. Unlike Alar, Spray-N-Grow is an organic chemical, a micronutrient that has been proven non-toxic in private tests, &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; officials said. It has been used by commercial vegetable growers and home gardeners for several years, the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; said. The Alar scare pushed prices for organic apples far above those for chemically treated apples. Organically grown red apples were selling for $1.29 at a Seattle market Thursday, compared to 39 cents per pound for other red apples. Alar\\'s most significant benefit was retaining the internal firmness of apples during months of cold storage. That will be tested with the new &lt;b&gt; chemical &lt;/b&gt; this year, Spray-N-Grow said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  abortion women humphrey souter state rights abortions anti-abortion hampshire gilbert adkins issues pregnant pregnancy woman smith birth souter\\'s control legal &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.417174672343128  \\n   Feminist leaders said Friday the clock would be turned back 25 years on women\\'s &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; if David Souter is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. ``If we lose this one, we\\'ll never get it back,\\'\\' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, who is lobbying the Senate to reject the nominee. Smeal said she had read all 200 of Souter\\'s &lt;b&gt; legal &lt;/b&gt; opinions and believes he would work to cut off women\\'s access to &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; and abortion. Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Souter revealed his opposition to &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; by calling it the ``killing of unborn children.\\'\\' ``That\\'s the language of the right wing,\\'\\' Yard said. Souter did not use the words during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings this week, but while New Hampshire attorney general he signed a brief that contained the language. However, during the hearings Friday, Souter said he has not made up his mind on the &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; issue and would consider both sides if he is confirmed. ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs. Wade,\\'\\' Souter in reference to the case that legalized abortion. ``I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up my mind and I would not go on the court saying I must go one way or I must go the other way.\\'\\' But Yard said that Souter\\'s repeated reference to the &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; position as ``the other side,\\'\\' was evidence of where he stood. Smeal and Yard, who have attended most of the hearings, said Souter\\'s answers to questions on constitutionally protected privacy &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; concerning &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; indicated he believed in the concept for married couples, but left open whether single people had the same right. Smeal said the addition of Souter to the court would create the majority needed to whittle away at a woman\\'s right to &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; until access no longer existed. ``It would take about 10 years,\\'\\' she said. ``First would be a requirement that teen-agers get parental consent for an abortion, then spousal consent.\\'\\' She predicted the court then would restrict the time period in which an &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; could be performed and then limit the kind of facility that could do the operation. Those decisions would be followed by requirements that teen-agers get parental consent for &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; requiring a physician\\'s prescription and later that &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; get their husbands\\' consent, Smeal said. ``The last step would be outlawing the sale of &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; to single people,\\'\\' she said. ``That would take us back to 1965.\\'\\' That year, in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a case involving the sale of contraceptives, the court for the first time recognized a constitutional right of privacy. The decision led to widespread availability of &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; for married and unmarried people. Smeal said women\\'s ability to get out from under the burden of unwanted pregnancies have been the key to the many advances they have been able to achieve outside the home. Smeal and Yard spoke to a rally organized by NOW across the street from the Capitol. About 150 people opposing the Souter nomination attended. &lt;/p&gt; 0.378563889866307  \\n   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a steadfast foe of legalized abortion, said Friday he has softened his stand for the tactical reason of finally getting an updated &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; law passed in New Hampshire. The conservative Republican, who is running for a &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Senate seat even though he retires in January from the U.S. Senate after two terms, said he has long supported &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; only to save the woman\\'s life, but now would support exceptions for rape and incest victims. In a telephone interview from his Chichester home, Humphrey said he\\'s easing his stance ``because that\\'s probably the only way that we can get a bill passed and signed into law that would address the 95 percent of &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; that have nothing to do with rape, incest or the life of the mother.\\'\\' Earlier this year, Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a bill that would have made &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; legal &lt;/b&gt; until the fetus could live outside the womb. Last year, Gregg vetoed a bill to repeal the state\\'s existing &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; laws, which date from the mid-1800s. Humphrey faces &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Rep. Jack Sherburne in the Sept. 11 Republican primary. Sherburne favors &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; rights, as does the incumbent, Republican William Johnson, who is running for Congress. Humphrey said his beliefs haven\\'t changed and that he hopes the public eventually will agree with him that ``each &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; kills a human being, and a human being is a human being irrespective of his circumstances of conception.\\'\\' Asked if he would revert to opposing exceptions for rape and incest if the political climate were favorable, Humphrey said, ``That would be my preference. But I don\\'t expect to see that day.\\'\\' He said he had not discussed his new position with &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; supporters, but expects some criticism. Warren Aldrich, legislative director for New Hampshire For L.I.F.E., would not comment directly on Humphrey\\'s change, but said his group ``would not take part in sponsoring or originating a bill that permits the taking of an unborn human life because of the circumstances of its conception.\\'\\' ``Rape and incest are tragic assaults on a woman\\'s life, but we do not believe that &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; is in any way therapeutic for the woman,\\'\\' he said. Peg Dobbie, &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, was surprised by Humphrey\\'s new stance. ``He seems like the guy who\\'s above it, the maverick who stands up for his convictions no matter what,\\'\\' she said. Even with the modifications, Humphrey\\'s stance ``is a very extreme &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; position,\\'\\' Dobbie said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.332828481610135  \\n   Radio dispatcher Jani Kochever received a very special early morning call from Clark County Sheriff\\'s Deputy Greg Chaney, known on the air as code number 140. ``Control 2, 140,\\'\\' Chaney said Tuesday. ``Personal request.\\'\\' ``Go ahead,\\'\\' replied Ms. Kochever, known on the radio as Control 2. ``Jani, will you marry me?\\'\\' Chaney asked. ``She sat there with her mouth open,\\'\\' said fellow dispatcher Pam Shurtliff. ``I almost answered for her. I was going to say, `Yeah, she\\'ll marry you.\\'\\'\\' When Ms. Kochever recovered, she replied, ``140, Control 2, absolutely I\\'ll marry you. ``And then another deputy said, `You can\\'t back out now, because we\\'re all witnesses,\\'\\'\\' the bride-to-be recalled. Ms. Kochever said she and Chaney had been dating about 10 months, but she had no hint he would make his graveyard-shift proposal. No wedding date has been set, but stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt; 0.323243998011928  \\n   The Idaho House voted Thursday to repeal the state\\'s &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; ``trigger law,\\'\\' which sets criminal penalties of up to five years in prison both for physicians who perform and &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; who get abortions. In developments elsewhere, Cincinnati\\'s archbishop asked &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinic operators to voluntarily refrain from Holy Communion, and Planned Parenthood said it would appeal a ruling upholding the federal government\\'s right to bar family planning aid to foreign organizations that perform abortions. And in Alabama, a bill that would require pre-abortion counseling and an overnight wait prior to any &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; passed the House of Representatives 79-18 on Thursday. But the measure faces tough election-year opposition in the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Senate. With little debate, Idaho House members voted 54-28 to erase the so-called trigger law, which wouldn\\'t take effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to outlaw abortion. The repeal measure was forwarded to the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; Senate, where it was expected to pass. ``I don\\'t think anyone in this House would like the &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; of Idaho to be subject to criminal penalties for having an abortion,\\'\\' said Rep. Gary Robbins, a Democrat who introduced the repeal measure. ``I think the &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; of Idaho are able to make their own choices, and if they do so I don\\'t think they ought to be penalized.\\'\\' The law was adopted by the Legislature in 1973, shortly after the Supreme Court\\'s Roe vs. Wade decision essentially legalizing &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; on demand through the first two trimesters of pregnancy. If it were to go into effect, the Idaho law would mandate prison terms of two to five years for physicians who perform &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; and one to five years for &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; undergoing them. The law couldn\\'t take effect under provisions of Roe vs. Wade, hence the ``trigger\\'\\' desingation. If the high court were to overturn that landmark ruling, and allow states to once again ban abortion, the Idaho law would take effect on a proclamation by the governor. In the Idaho House debate Thursday, &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; lawmakers argued that lifting the threat of criminal penalties ignores the &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; of the unborn. ``Some of us are here to speak for those who can\\'t speak for themselves. Do they not count for something?\\'\\' asked Rep. Elizabeth Allan-Hodge, a Republican. ``For those of us who believe it is murder to kill the unborn, we cannot possibly believe we should slap them on the hand and tell them it\\'s wrong.\\'\\' In Cincinnati, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk said Wednesday that Roman Catholics who operate &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics or promote &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; shouldn\\'t receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. The head of the Cincinnati Archdiocese stopped short of excommunicating or forbidding Holy Communion to pro-choice activists. ``Catholics who obstinately persist in these activities, while perhaps not formally excommunicated, should not consider themselves properly disposed to participate in receiving Holy Communion,\\'\\' Pilarczyk said. Pilarcayk\\'s statement was released after a meeting with &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; opponents who complained that Barbara Rinto, a Catholic who is the new director of Planned Parenthood of Cncinnati, violates church law by operating a clinic that performs abortions. Ms. Rinto has said that her feelings on &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; are ``between me and my God,\\'\\' and that her beliefs about &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; and reproduction are private. In New York, Planned Parenthood announced Thursday it would appeal a ruling by a federal judge there that upheld a federal policy _ instituted under the Reagan administration and continued under President Bush _ barring family planning aid to private foreign organizations that perform abortions. The policy, adopted by the Agency for International Development 1984, requires that foreign private health agencies, in return for American grants, certify that they didn\\'t perform or actively promote &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; as a method of family planning. Planned Parenthood, which assists private foreign agencies, had charged that the policy was a violation of their First Amendment right to advocate &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; and interfered with the &lt;b&gt; rights &lt;/b&gt; of privacy of people seeking family planning information. &lt;/p&gt; 0.321669305819114  \\n   A federal judge approved a settlement Thursday that keeps the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; from restricting &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; less than 18 weeks pregnant. U.S. District Judge John Nordberg agreed to the settlement between Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The court finds the proposed consent decree lawful, fair, reasonable and adequate,\\'\\' the judge wrote in the 13-page opinion. Anti-abortion groups opposed the settlement, calling it ``unconscionable and unconstitutional.\\'\\' Ragsdale vs. Turnock was settled Nov. 24, just days before the U.S. Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the case. It was one of several that &lt;b&gt; anti-abortion &lt;/b&gt; groups had hoped would be used as a test case for the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The settlement permits the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; to regulate &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics without removing the availability of &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt; women &lt;/b&gt; who are less than 18 weeks pregnant. Under the agreement, access to &lt;b&gt; abortions &lt;/b&gt; cannot be restricted by substantially increasing the cost of the procedure or reducing the number of clinics. The lawsuit was brought by Rockford physician Richard Ragsdale, who objected to regulations requiring &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics to be equipped and staffed like small hospitals. He said the regulation was a veiled attempt to restrict access to abortions. One of the requirements deleted from the settlement mandated that patients receive counseling about &lt;b&gt; birth &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; control &lt;/b&gt; and adoption and that counselors be people who wouldn\\'t profit from abortions. The settlement also eliminated a requirement that all &lt;b&gt; abortion &lt;/b&gt; clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a ``certificate of need\\'\\' from the &lt;b&gt; state &lt;/b&gt; verifying that they do not duplicate similar services in their areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  united states trade japan countries foreign world japanese international american economic nations agreement european imports canada europe talks farm america &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.546147065172188  \\n   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and European Economic Community officials agreed Tuesday to step up &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; contacts. Takeshita responded favorably to a suggestion by EEC Commission President Jacques Delors to create a panel of experts to discuss technical aspects of the EEC\\'s rocky &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relations with Japan, officials said. Takeshita also stressed the need for Japan and the 12-nation EEC to widen their relations beyond &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; to cultural and scientific sectors. ``The relationship between Europe and Japan is not very strong or as well developed\\'\\' as that between the United States with Europe and Japan, an aide to Takeshita told reporters. Senior EEC and Japanese officials meet annually. An EEC official said Delors believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in defusing &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; tensions. The EEC is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of dumping by Japanese exporters. The EEC official, who asked not to be named, said EEC Foreign Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq noted a ``remarkable improvement in &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relations\\'\\' between the 12-nation &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; bloc and Japan, even though the EEC continues to register a large &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; deficit with Japan. The gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987, but was still $25 billion. For his part, Takeshita said the EEC\\'s plans to turn the 12 EEC &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; into a single, borderless market by the end of 1992 was good for Japan. But his aide quoted him as saying, ``The ... single market after 1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world\\'\\' and that the EEC should remove restrictions on Japanese exports. But he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade, an issue the EEC has given high priority in order to gain greater access for European goods to the Japanese market. ``We fully understand what (the EEC) Commission people are saying on reciprocity but Japan cannot agree to reciprocity on a sectoral basis,\\'\\' Takeshita was quoted as saying. Among specific &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; issues discussed were Japan\\'s high taxes on imported liquor and cars, the difficulties of &lt;b&gt; foreign &lt;/b&gt; companies\\' bidding on Japanese public works projects and better access for EEC exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors. The EEC side also urged Japan to liberalize its banking sector. Officials said Delors stressed European banks must be able to establish themselves in Japan to make it easier to finance European exports and investments. De Clercq also called on Japan to quickly comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruling to amend an accord with the United States on &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; in semiconductors. The &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; body has ruled the deal discriminates against the EEC. Takeshita also asked Delors\\' advice as to the best way to distribute $500 million Japan has earmarked as special &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; assistance to Africa. ``We are aware that European &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; have a long relationship with African countries,\\'\\' the aide quoted Takeshita as saying. &lt;/p&gt; 0.522992875103849  \\n   The United States and Japan reached a &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; Monday that could double U.S. exports of beef and oranges to more than $1 billion a year, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. ``My judgment is that this will turn out to be a landmark &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; in U.S.-Japan &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; relations,\\'\\' Yeutter said following marathon &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; with Japanese leaders. The &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; calls on Japan to nearly double its &lt;b&gt; imports &lt;/b&gt; of beef by 1991, and phase out involvement by Livestock Industry Promotion Corp., which currently controls most beef imports. Japan would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 1991, 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to allow Japanese farmers time to adjust. Japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22,000 tons annually, to 192,000 tons in 1990. After that, fresh oranges from the United States would be permitted in unlimited quantities, at the current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 percent off season. Quotas on orange juice will also be phased out. The United States also demanded and got compensation on tariffs for other &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; products in return for concessions on allowing Japan to slowly phase out its tariffs. Included were liberalized restrictions on &lt;b&gt; imports &lt;/b&gt; of grapefruit, lemons, frozen peaches and pears, pistachios, macadamias, pecans, walnuts, pet food, beef jerky, sausage and pork and beans. As part of the agreement, the United States agreed to withdraw a complaint filed with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; body that oversees &lt;b&gt; international &lt;/b&gt; trade. The two sides agreed to further discuss Japan\\'s emergency import curbs during the current round of &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; under GATT. The temporary &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; was signed by Yeutter and Takashi Sato, Japan\\'s agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. Yeutter said the official documents would be signed in Washington, hopefully in the next few weeks, after the United States gathers the documents it needs. Cabinet Secretary Minister Keizo Obuchi welcomed the agreement, telling a regular news conference Monday that ``it reconfirms that the United States and Japan are able to solve their problems through joint efforts.\\'\\' He said the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; can be fully implemented without hurting Japanese farmers. Yeutter said the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; ``will require some creative and innovative thinking\\'\\' on the part of Japanese officials in helping Japanese farmers adjust. However, he said Japanese consumers will benefit through an increased standard of living and cheaper prices, while Japan\\'s economy will benefit through increased competition. He said the United States will be closely watching Japan to make sure the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; is put into effect. A similar pact on computer chips came under attack last year after the United States accused Japan of circumventing the spirit of the &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; by selling computer chips at unfairly low prices through third countries. That battle is still being fought through GATT. Yeutter said that ``it would be unfortunate if government agencies were to attempt to circumvent the spirit of this agreement.\\'\\' Yeutter also said the United States has no plans at this time to expand its demands to include the liberalization of rice, another thorny issue in Japan-U.S. relations. However, he said he could not rule out that possibility in the future if the United States is provoked. While agreeing to eliminate the beef import restrictions, Japan retained the right to raise the tariffs temporarily by 25 percent if beef &lt;b&gt; imports &lt;/b&gt; exceed the previous year\\'s level by 20 percent. After the transitional period ending in 1993, Japan\\'s beef tariffs will be subject to discussions in the GATT. Sato, the agriculture minister, said the Japanese government will soon begin negotiations with Australia, another major beef exporter, on the Japanese import restrictions. Associations of Japanese orange growers and cattle farmers criticized the agreement. ``As producers who had been closely following the course of negotiations, we can\\'t help but keenly feel regret and anger,\\'\\' Mitsugu Horiuchi, president of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; 0.519057517264268  \\n   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga says a free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; between his country and the United States is being considered more seriously because recent successes in resolving &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; disputes have improved relations between the two nations. It is time to ``build our partnership on the basis of our interlocking strengths instead of constantly warring over our separate weaknesses,\\'\\' Matsunaga told the Washington Council on International Trade last week. The ambassador said that the much-discussed U.S. &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; deficit and the corresponding Japanese &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; surplus ``simply do not comprehend\\'\\' the scope and complexity of the &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; and political relationships between the two countries. ``It is quite understandable, therefore, that thoughtful people on both sides of the Pacific are now considering the possible benefits of some form of free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; arrangement between the United States and Japan, the two largest and most dynamic economies in the world, whose two-way &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; is exceeded in value only by America\\'s &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; with Canada...\\'\\' Matsunaga said in his Thursday address. A U.S.-Japan free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; _ which essentially would remove &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers between the two &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; _ was proposed first in 1981 by Mike Mansfield, U.S. ambassador to Japan. The initial reaction was widespread skepticism that two &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; with such different cultures and legal systems could fashion a workable agreement. But earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd raised the issue with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. And Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and now Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to prepare a report listing the pros and cons of such an agreement. The interest is driven not only by the increasingly complex &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relationship between the two countries, but by concerns by both about their &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; relations with other nations. Japan has concerns about how the U.S.-Canada free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; may affect its own &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; with the United States and Canada. And both &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; are concerned that the lowering of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers among European Community nations, scheduled for 1992, could lead to increased difficulty in gaining access to that market. David Rohr, a member of the federal International Trade Commission who recently visited Japan to gather opinions for the study requested by Bentsen, said the Japanese are ``really scared\\'\\' of the sweeping U.S. &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; bill _ signed into law last week and criticized by Matsunaga as ``disproportionately protectionist\\'\\' _ because of its sanctions for unfair &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; practices. &lt;/p&gt; 0.4786823304804  \\n   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today opened the most ambitious &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; negotiations ever undertaken, urging officials of 90 &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; to compromise to resolve &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; differences. In an apparent reference to a clash between the United States and its allies on &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; subsidies, Mulroney exhorted the delegates to ``be motivated by a spirit of honorable compromise.\\'\\' Mulroney said farmers around the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; ``are looking for results in Montreal. They can no longer survive on a diet of promises.\\'\\' The round of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; negotiations is designed to liberalize and broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an &lt;b&gt; international &lt;/b&gt; trade-policing treaty signed in 1947. GATT now has 96 members, and 90 &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; ministers were at today\\'s meeting. The U.S. delegation has come under strong criticism from Japan, Australia and the European Community over its demand to completely eliminate government supports for farmers. The 12-nation European Community is only willing to reduce them, terming the U.S. position unrealistic. Mulroney urged the negotiators to ``be animated by a spirit of realism,\\'\\' echoing similar weekend calls to the United States in preparatory consultations for the mid-term review of the four-year Uruguay Round of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; talks. The United States was further isolated by a tentative accord reached between the Europeans and developing &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; that would remove or reduce tariffs on the export of tropical products to the industrialized world. An EC spokeswoman said the United States did not yet support the agreement, which would affect $70 billion in internaional &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; of such products as jute, bananas and coffee. Michael Duffy, Australia\\'s Minister of Trade Negotiations, told reporters Sunday that blame for U.S.-European impasse over &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers should be shared by the two parties. But he and other officials looked to the Americans to make the first move. Duffy warned that if neither side compromises during the three-day talks, ``it will sour the rest of the round,\\'\\' which ends in 1990. The dispute over agricultural subsidies has clouded prospects for progress on other urgent &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; problems, such as the inclusion of the booming services &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; in the 40-year-old GATT pact and the adoption of safeguards for copyrights and patents. ``It\\'s hard to see how there can be progress in other areas without progress in agriculture,\\'\\' said John Crosbie, Canada\\'s Minister for International Trade. The United States took a conciliatory stand but insisted it would stick to its main objective. Chief agriculture negotiator Dan Amstutz noted the United States had moved away from setting a 2000 deadline for elimination of subsidies and agreed to emergency government food stockpiles as long as they are bought on the open market. ``We\\'re flexible,\\'\\' he said, but ``we\\'d rather not have any &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; than a bad one.\\'\\' The U.S. delegation also appeared to hold out the possibility it would relent on its rejection of a proposal lifting barriers on the export of tropical products, such as bananas and coconuts, by developing nations. U.S. &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; negotiator Alan Holmer warned that failure by the GATT round could create ``uncertainties\\'\\' in Congress and within the incoming administration of George Bush. He did not elaborate. But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said failure on the &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; support issue would result in an ``export-oriented\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; bill. Congress is scheduled to draft a &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; bill next year and Leahy indicated it would include supports for farmers so they can compete effectively against farmers whose governments also subsidize exports. The United States projects that its 1989 &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; supports will amount to $13 billion _ down from the $27 million of 1987 but still a heavy burden on the deficit-ridden budget. U.S. officials say Europeans could save about $200 billion every year if they stopped their &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; supports. But the EC, under the influence of powerful &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; lobbies, says eliminating supports is not a viable option. &lt;/p&gt; 0.461372217496813  \\n   The United States would be happy to consider negotiating a free-trade &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; with Japan along the lines of the treaty reached with Canada, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said Friday. While there are no current discussion about such a treaty, it would fit into this country\\'s overall strategy to break down &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers wherever they exist, he said. ``We have a major trading relationship with Japan,\\'\\' Baker said. ``It (a free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; agreement) would be something that the United States would be pleased to consider if it were something that the government of Japan wanted to consider.\\'\\' Baker\\'s comments came in a television interview with &lt;b&gt; foreign &lt;/b&gt; journalists for broadcast outside the United States by the U.S. Information Agency. The session was a preview of the seven-nation &lt;b&gt; economic &lt;/b&gt; summit opening Sunday in Toronto. President Reagan, addressing the annual conference of the USIA International Council, meantime, reiterated his belief in free &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; while saying &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers of other &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; are generating protectionist pressures in America. ``It damages the entire &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; economy when &lt;b&gt; foreign &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; fail to offer the same opportunity to American exports that America offers to their products,\\'\\' Reagan said. ``It is this basic sense of fairness that has helped generate protectionist pressures in America. Let me repeat protectionism, the closing of America\\'s markets, is the wrong response; opening markets, that, I firmly believe, is the answer.\\'\\' Meanwhile, there appeared to be movement on another contentious &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; dispute between Japan and the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Friday that he was leaving immediately for Japan, saying a deal may be near on ending that nation\\'s restrictions on beef imports. ``We certainly have not yet reached an agreement, but I\\'m persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a trip,\\'\\' Yeutter said. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We remain hopeful,\\'\\' but added, ``Until there\\'s a deal, there\\'s no deal.\\'\\' The Agriculture Department has placed the overall value of the Japanese beef market at $2 billion. A U.S.-Japan free-trade &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; would presumably be of substantial benefit to this country because U.S. officials for years have pressured the Japanese to open their markets to American products as a way of reducing the huge &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; imbalance between the two nations. The Japanese ran up a &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; surplus with the United States last year of $59.8 billion, more than one-third of this country\\'s America\\'s overall &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; deficit of $170.3 billion. The U.S.-Canada pact now being considered by Congress and the Canadian Parliament would end all &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers within 10 years. Some critics have charged that specific &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; pacts such as the U.S.-Canada &lt;b&gt; agreement &lt;/b&gt; or the plan to eliminate all barriers between the 12-nation European Economic Community by 1992 pose risks of returning the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; to the &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; cartels of the 1930s, which worked to shrink &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; rather than expanding it. But Baker disputed this, saying the United States saw any &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; liberalization agreements as beneficial. He said America preferred to pursue reduction of &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; barriers through the discussions being held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But he hinted that if those &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; did not reach a successful conclusion, the United States would look to &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; pacts with smaller groups of countries. Baker said the summit between President Reagan and other Western leaders would include a full-fledged discussion of Reagan\\'s proposal to eliminate all &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; subsidies by the year 2000. These subsidies are costing the major industrial &lt;b&gt; countries &lt;/b&gt; $150 billion annually in higher government support payments and increased food costs to consumers. He acknowledged that the U.S. proposal to eliminate subsidies was facing intense opposition, with Washington hoping basically for a reiteration in Toronto of a pledge the industrialized &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; made last month in Paris to press forward in negotiations on the issue. The U.S. delegation, led by Baker, had pressed for more specific language to adopt Reagan\\'s call for a subsidy-free &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; in agricultural &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; by a specific date. But Baker contended Friday that progress had been made in Paris. ``The fact that we are even discussing this very difficult problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress,\\'\\' he said. ``It is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all able to go to our farmers and say the &lt;b&gt; world &lt;/b&gt; is going to do this.\\'\\' European &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; have argued that it is politically impossible to eliminate all &lt;b&gt; farm &lt;/b&gt; subsidies and a proper compromise would be to reduce them, perhaps by cutting them in half. The United States is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a Montreal &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; meeting in December. The Montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current round of global &lt;b&gt; trade &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; talks &lt;/b&gt; which were launched in 1986 in Uruguay and scheduled to end in 1990. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  south africa black african mandela apartheid government anc national klerk white blacks congress sanctions release anti-apartheid end leaders question racial &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.506518336418872  \\n   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha apologized on behalf of the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday for a police search of the West German consul\\'s home, but also criticized West Germany\\'s policies. Police searched the home of Erhard Loeser, West Germany\\'s acting consul-general, on Monday. They were looking for Heinrich Grosskopf, a 24-year-old &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; South African accused of a car-bombing last week that killed three people. Officials claim Grosskopf carried out that bombing and at least one other on orders from the outlawed African National Congress, the predominantly &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; guerrilla group fighting to &lt;b&gt; end &lt;/b&gt; domination by South Africa\\'s &lt;b&gt; white &lt;/b&gt; minority. Botha gave no reason why police decided to search Loeser\\'s home and coupled his apology with an attack on Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany for suggesting a boycott of South African products as a means of protesting the &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; policy. He said the suggestion was ``callously irresponsible\\'\\' and a boycott would ``deprive people of their livelihood.\\'\\' The foreign minister also criticized Genscher for questioning the fairness of legal proceedings for the ``Sharpeville Six,\\'\\' a group of &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; granted a one-month stay of execution last week. They were convicted of complicity in the mob killing of a &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; official.

The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. &lt;/p&gt; 0.489276487407147  \\n   The African National Congress recommended Monday that Nelson Mandela meet rival &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a breakthrough that could help ease the violence in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; townships. The ANC proposed a meeting between itself and Buthelezi\\'s conservative Inkatha Freedom Party ``in the near future,\\'\\' but did not specify a date. The ANC statement said both Mandela and Buthelezi should attend. Buthelezi said he welcomed the offer and was ready to consider a suitable time and place for the talks. Mandela is in Australia and will be traveling throughout Asia until early November. Since his &lt;b&gt; release &lt;/b&gt; from prison in February, Mandela has turned down invitations from his old friend Buthelezi despite the ongoing violence between their supporters in the eastern province of Natal and in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; areas outside Johannesburg. ANC &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; have harshly briticized Buthelezi and accused him of orchestrating the violence to obtain a meeting with Mandela and enhance his stature. Buthelezi has denied the charge and accused the ANC of trying to destroy all rivals. The ANC was conciliatory in its statement Monday. The group said ``it welcomed the steps being taken jointly by the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party\\'\\' to stop the violence. The two sides have been holding periodic peace talks, but neither Mandela nor Buthelezi has attended. About 5,000 &lt;b&gt; blacks &lt;/b&gt; have died in the ANC-Inkatha power struggle since 1986 in Natal Province. The fighting spread to the Johannesburg area in August and has claimed 800 lives. The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; opposition movements, both oppose &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; but differ over tactics and a future South Africa. The socialist-oriented ANC has employed boycotts, strikes, protests and waged an armed struggle, recently suspended, in its battle against the government. Inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors capitalism. The ANC draws support across tribal lines, while virtually all Inkatha members are Zulus. The ANC also has opposed Buthelezi\\'s role as leader of the KwaZulu homeland in Natal Province. The ANC considers the 10 &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; homelands part of the &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; system. Buthelezi, meanwhile, sees the limited self-government in the homelands as an interim step on the road to &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; majority rule. &lt;/p&gt; 0.465480196432289  \\n   Alan Paton, the country\\'s best known author, was recovering today from surgery for an undisclosed ailment, a press report said. Paton, whose 1948 novel ``Cry, The Beloved Country\\'\\' drew a compelling picture of South Africa\\'s &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; system of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; segregation, was in ``fairly serious condition\\'\\' after Tuesday\\'s operation, according to an unidentified heart surgeon quoted by the South African Press Association. A spokeswoman at St. Augustine\\'s Hospital in Durban said today that Paton was in stable condition. The 85-year-old novelist underwent surgery after being admitted to the Durban hospital Monday, the news agency said. Paton\\'s ``Cry, The Beloved Country\\'\\' is the second best-selling book ever in South Africa after the Bible.

Botha, who represented President F. W. de Klerk, addressed the heads of state as ``my African brothers\\'\\' during the informal meeting, which was punctuated by joking and laughter. The breakfast host was Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, head of the seven-nation Frontline States, a regional bloc that once led efforts to &lt;b&gt; end &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; apartheid &lt;/b&gt; in South Africa. The other two &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; were President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who maintains close contacts with South Africa, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, the current chairman of the 51-member Organization of African unity. President Bush sent a congratulatory message, saying the meeting ``marks a new era in Africa.\\'\\' The get-together over eggs, bacon and croissants signaled a further easing of tensions between white-led South Africa and its &lt;b&gt; anti-apartheid &lt;/b&gt; neighbors. Zambian officials said it was made possible by de Klerk\\'s recent steps toward dismantling apartheid, including legalizing the African National Congress, freeing political prisoners including the ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and lifting the state of emergency in &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; townships. The ANC, outlawed for 30 years in South Africa, had its headquarters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka until early this year. Kaunda, once one of the most vocal African critics of apartheid, said the theme of the meeting was ``peace, unity and reconciliation.\\'\\' Botha told the &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; African &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; that South Africa could help economic development in the largely impoverished region, adding: ``We in Africa must join hands and move closer together.\\'\\' ``South Africa must play its rightful role in southern Africa and we are ready to play that role,\\'\\' Botha said. Ugandan President Museveni said he got the idea for such a meeting from a prayer breakfast he attended with U.S. congressmen two years ago. He wanted to organize something similar, he said, but as he was not a good Christian he asked Kaunda to be host. Three other African heads of state, Quett Masire of Botswana, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and Metsing Lekhanya of Lesotho, were invited but did not attend. &lt;/p&gt; 0.443119008127283  \\n   Zulus fired assault rifles at Xhosas sleeping in a workers barracks early Monday, leaving 22 people dead and pushing the death toll to 364 in a week of tribal clashes, police said. Zulus and Xhosas, the country\\'s two largest &lt;b&gt; black &lt;/b&gt; tribes and longtime rivals, have been waging vicious battles since Aug. 12 in the townships surrounding Johannesburg. Police and eyewitnesses said Zulus armed with AK-47 rifles raided a Xhosa workers hostel early Monday in KwaThema township east of Johannesburg. At least 22 people were killed, many of them Xhosas shot in their beds, they said. Police in armored vehicles moved in after dawn to restore order. Enraged Xhosas set fire to a hostel used by Zulus before being driven off. Fighting also flared in nearby townships, resulting in several deaths. Looters continued to pillage hostels abandoned by Zulu migrant workers. People carted away refrigerators, stoves and anything else they could find. Johannesburg newspapers Monday reported five killings Sunday in the Soweto township by the ``necklace\\'\\' method, whereby youths put gasoline-soaked tires around the necks of victims and set them alight. Police on Monday raised the death toll for the fighting from the past week to 364 and said hundreds were injured. ``We just keep finding bodies. They\\'re everywhere,\\'\\' said a police spokesman. The fighting appears to be mostly a tribal conflict with a long history, but it also has political overtones. Nelson Mandela and many other &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; of the African National Congress, the largest opposition movement, are Xhosas. The ANC\\'s rival, Inkatha, is a Zulu-based organization headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, the system of &lt;b&gt; racial &lt;/b&gt; segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and economic control over 30 million blacks. But the two groups differ over tactics and plans for a future South Africa. ANC leader Walter Sisulu ruled out peace talks between Mandela and Buthelezi, saying it would be a capitulation. ``That means Inkatha launches a war in order to bring us to our knees. For that type of thing we are not prepared,\\'\\' he said in a weekend television interview. Mandela\\'s wife, Winnie, warned the ANC may be forced to resume its armed struggle to protect is supporters. The ANC agreed Aug. 6 to suspend it largely ineffective guerrilla campaign. Mrs. Mandela accused the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; of ``working hand-in-hand\\'\\' with the relatively conservative Inkatha movement in the fighting against Xhosas, the independent South African Press Association reported. Also, the &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; has revoked immunity from prosecution for three ANC leaders, including the head of the group\\'s military wing, Chris Hani. The three men, Hani, Ronnie Kasrils and Mac Maharaj, also are members of the South African Communist Party, a close ANC ally. The &lt;b&gt; government &lt;/b&gt; gave no reason for the decision. But it was seen as a signal that authorities are upset with militant statements made recently by some ANC leaders. The trio are among more than 40 ANC &lt;b&gt; leaders &lt;/b&gt; granted temporary immunity three months ago so they could participate in peace talks. All but Hani, Kasrils and Maharaj have had their immunity extended until the &lt;b&gt; end &lt;/b&gt; of the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  bill house senate committee sen rep congress legislation chairman measure vote year lawmakers congressional members subcommittee republican proposal leader approved &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.48489727105023  \\n   The House on Thursday rejected a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from desecration, heeding opponents who said it would risk damage to the Bill of Rights. The 254-177 tally left the amendment, which was supported by President Bush, 34 votes short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Republicans voted 159-17 for it, Democrats 160-95 against. The &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; followed a sometimes impassioned day of debate featuring more than 100 speeches, including a rare address by the speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``We should not amend the Constitution of the United States to reach the sparse and scattered and despicable conduct of a few who would dishonor the flag and defile it,\\'\\' said Foley, who also cast a rare speaker\\'s &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; to register his opposition to the amendment. By tradition, the speaker does not normally engage in debate or vote. Countered Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``Let us take the flag out of the gutter where the counterculture has dragged it and is smearing it. We have 10 amendments that guarantee us all sorts of rights. How about one amendment that gives us a duty?\\'\\' Foley told reporters that Thursday\\'s &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; would be the last one on the amendment this &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; in the House, but Republicans promised to keep the issue alive. ``I am confident this debate is going to go on for a long time,\\'\\' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told the chamber. Asked about the Bush\\'s efforts on behalf of the amendment, Gingrich said ``it was very hard for the president in two days to override the speaker.\\'\\' Supporters of the amendment, backed by veterans\\' groups seeking more time to lobby, had tried to delay Thursday\\'s &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; until next week but were defeated 231-192. Rep. Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., the &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the House Veterans Committee and the amendment\\'s prime Democratic sponsor, said of the proposal, ``I think we owe it to the brave Americans who have died for this country.\\'\\' But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., decried the attempt to modify the First Amendment. ``When I look around the politicians today, I see more people who remind me of Daffy Duck than Thomas Jefferson,\\'\\' he said. The strength of the opposition was larger than expected and was aided by the unexpected support of some conservatives. ``Up until 24 hours ago, I was a sponsor of this amendment,\\'\\' said Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C. ``But over the rhetoric of the past few days, I finally heard the voice of my own conscience.\\'\\' The amendment read, ``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\\'\\' It was first proposed in 1989 after the Supreme Court ruled that flag burning was a form of protected free speech. The issue was revived last week when the court rejected last year\\'s attempt to pass an anti-flag-burning law that the court could accept. After the &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; on the amendment, the House also rejected a new statute _ not a constitutional amendment _ to ban flag burning. The bill, narrowly drawn in hopes of avoiding court rejection, would impose fines and jail terms for people who burn flags to promote violence or who burn flags on federal property or belonging to the federal government. Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after their leadership called it a ``fig leaf\\'\\' to protect Democrats who opposed the constitutional amendment, and it lost 236-179. The Senate is expected to &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; next week on the amendment, which would require a two-thirds &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; in both chambers, and approval by 38 of the 50 states, for ratification. Foley said the House would not &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; again this year. Regardless of the outcome on Capitol Hill, Republicans promise to raise the issue in this fall\\'s campaign. The House majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., acknowledged the political tightrope &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; were walking. Several &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; decorated their speeches with flags and other props. Rep. Gary Ackerman, trying to highlight the difficulty of enforcing &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; to protect the flag, held aloft a wide variety of household items and gags decorated with the stars and stripes. ``How about American flag napkins,\\'\\' he said, holding one. ``What if you blow your nose in one. Have you broken the law?\\'\\' Although Ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the debate, Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he was offended. Most Republican speakers supported the amendment; the bulk of opposition came from Democrats. There also was a noticeable generational tilt in the debate. House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., a decorated World War II veteran, co-sponsored the amendment and called it ``a measured, prudent, limited thoughtful approach to the problem.\\'\\' ``Surely this is something different from the `assault on the Bill of Rights\\' some critics say it is,\\'\\' he said. Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., another World War II vet, used photographs of the famed Iwo Jima flag raising and of a flag-burning protest in New York\\'s Central Park to dramatize his support for the amendment. But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a Vietnam veteran who said he would ``never forget the sacrifices that have been made so that our flag can fly proudly and freely,\\'\\' was a &lt;b&gt; leader &lt;/b&gt; of the opposition. ``In 200 years of our history, these basic freedoms have never been amended, never. And if we start now, who knows what freedoms will be next? ... Where will it end?\\'\\' he asked. &lt;/p&gt; 0.457894118691134  \\n   In an election-year bow to an agency that serves one-third of all Americans, the Senate voted Tuesday to give the Veterans Administration a seat in the president\\'s Cabinet. The &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; was passed by an 84-11 vote. The House &lt;b&gt; approved &lt;/b&gt; similar &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; last November, a week after the idea was advanced by President Reagan. Negotiators from the the Senate and House will work out minor differences between the two bills. The Department of Veterans\\' Affairs would become the 14th in the Cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 1989. Sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard in the highest councils of government. Opponents called the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; another example of &lt;b&gt; congressional &lt;/b&gt; pandering to special interests. ``In recent years the VA has frequently been relegated to a relatively insignificant role within the executive branch, with the administrator having little or no access to the president or other top officials in the White House,\\'\\' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the Senate Veterans\\' Affairs Committee. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who has been promoting a veterans\\' department since 1975, said his support is not aimed at getting more money for veterans. ``Given the nature and scope of the VA, it is appropriate that we make it an executive department ... (to) ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively administered.\\'\\' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., a former Veterans Committee chairman, opposed creation of the Cabinet seat. He bitterly criticized some veterans\\' service organizations for supporting the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; while they fought another measure, passed Monday by the Senate, that would allow courts to overturn some VA decisions on veterans\\' benefits. ``If anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice ... than they already have, then I\\'ve missed something in the nine years I\\'ve been year,\\'\\' Simpson said. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; ``absurd... silly... goofy... illogical ... irresponsible. This is rubbish. This is unprincipled (prostitution) after special-interest groups.\\'\\' According to the Veterans\\' Affairs Committee, VA serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of $30 billion, making it the largest independent federal agency. It will dispense $14 billion in income maintenance and $626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that converting the VA into a Cabinet department would cost $33 million over five years. The biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on VA buildings. The &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; would reorganize VA operations and allow the secretary of veterans\\' affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and 15 deputy assistants. The &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; requires that the top operating officers _ the chief medical director and chief benefits director _ be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard to politics. Voting against elevating VA to the Cabinet were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Humphrey; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; James McClure, R-Idaho; William Proxmire, D-Wis.; Dan Quayle, R-Ind.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Simpson, and Steven Symms, R-Idaho. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Paul Trible, R-Va., and John Warner, R-Va. &lt;/p&gt; 0.404044827963029  \\n   Special interests paid nearly $600,000 last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; for speeches by a half-dozen top leaders in the House. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the tax-writing committee, took in the most with $285,000, according to financial disclosure reports made public Tuesday. Rank-and-file &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; shared in the speechmaking windfall to supplement their $89,500 salaries. All told, House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; accepted millions of dollars for speaking and writing, and many got more for talking than the average family earns in a year. The flow of speaking fees, mostly from special interests that ranged from colleges to banks, was hardly slowed by the allegations of financial improprieties that led last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; to the resignations of Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the majority whip. Wright\\'s successor, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported he received $32,000 in honoraria. Coelho\\'s successor, Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., claimed $164,098. Foley\\'s successor as majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., reported $34,500. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., was the top talk-for-pay lawmaker outside the leadership, with $160,517. House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; are allowed to keep honoraria equivalent to 30 percent of their salaries and most give what is left to charity. Rostenkowski traditionally spreads the excess among churches and schools in his hometown of Chicago. Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia handed over $29,304 of his $67,491 in fees to the Atlanta zoo. The disclosure statements of most House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; were made public Tuesday, although some &lt;b&gt; lawmakers &lt;/b&gt; were granted extensions. Senators\\' reports will be released Wednesday. Speaking and writing fees were not the only source of outside income for &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of the House, which has dozens of millionaires. One of the wealthiest, Rep. Amory Houghton, R-N.Y., an heir to the Corning Glass Works fortune, received $127,000 last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; for managing family trusts. Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., listed dividends of $5,000 to $15,000 from his stake in a popular barbecue restaurant, Red, Hot `n Blue, in Arlington, Va. Rep. Ronald Machtley, R-R.I., earned interest by lending money to his own campaign committee. Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, pocketed a $24,000 salary from his law firm, $11,913 in Social Security benefits and as much as $15,000 from his stake in a thoroughbred horse breeding operation. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is under investigation by the House ethics &lt;b&gt; committee &lt;/b&gt; because of his association with a male prostitute, was paid between $15,000 and $50,000 as an advance on a book he is writing. Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., an actor who played on the old ``Dukes of Hazzard\\'\\' show, received a $10,625 advance for his autobiography. Another ex-actor, Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, earned $26,219 in royalties from his tour on the ``Love Boat\\'\\' series. Rep. J. Howard Coble, R-N.C., won $600 in a &lt;b&gt; congressional &lt;/b&gt; pinball tournament and donated it to charities in his district. Rep. Curtis Weldon, R-Pa., who once helped extinguish a fire in a House office building, was reimbursed for expenses of 19 speaking trips to fire-fighting organizations in 16 states last year. He received no fees for those speeches. Weldon is a founder of the &lt;b&gt; congressional &lt;/b&gt; fire-prevention caucus. Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., earned $17,307 as &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the Massachusetts State Democratic Committee. Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., sold a 1948 Chrysler roadster for something between $15,000 and $50,000. Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., earned nearly $14,000 designing Indian jewelry. Rep. Herbert Callahan, D-Ala., was paid $12,000 in director\\'s fees from the Finch Companies. Although Democrats, who control the House, were paid the most for their speechmaking, Republicans shared in the wealth. Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois reported $49,300. Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, who heads the House Republican Conference, was paid $31,000. As part of a &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; raising their government salaries, House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; agreed that 1990 will be the last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; they will receive honoraria. Senators will allow themselves lower government salaries than House &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; after this &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; but will keep their speaking fees. In addition to their speaking fees and other honoraria, &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; of Congress and most other federal officials are required to disclose their assets, not including their homes; their investments, most liabilities and gifts. The forms require that values be listed only by broad category. For example, a multimillion-dollar holding is reported only as worth more than $250,000. Some &lt;b&gt; members &lt;/b&gt; are more precise. Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., whose seniority and Appropriations Committee position make him one of the most powerful House members, listed no speaking fees, no gifts, no liabilities, no investment transactions and no membership in any organization. He listed nine properties valued at $144,978 from which he collected $4,200 in rent, and the $4,131 savings account that earned $212 interest. Not all are so lucky in their finances. Rep. Tommy F. Robinson, R-Ark., who switched parties last year, listed among his liabilities more than $250,000 he owes Jerral W. Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Jones\\' daughter left a $60,000-a-year job on Robinson\\'s staff last &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; after the congressman and Jones had a falling out over Robinson\\'s plans to run for governor. Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., reported assets of between zero and $5,000 with no liabilities. On the other hand, Gephardt, who sold rental homes in Missouri last year, had no liabilities but assets of as much as $915,000. Rep. William Green, R-N.Y., an heir to the Grand Union food stores, reported one of the highest 1989 incomes among House members, at least $507,857 and perhaps as much as $1.26 million. His campaign &lt;b&gt; committee &lt;/b&gt; returned to him between $100,000 and $250,000 of personal funds he had invested in his 1984 re-election effort. &lt;/p&gt; 0.385928898412753  \\n   The Senate passed &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; today that would permit the death penalty for drug dealers convicted of murder, rejecting pleas that the &lt;b&gt; measure &lt;/b&gt; would be a move toward ``reducing the civility\\'\\' of society. The election-year &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; was sent to the House on a 65-29 vote. The bill\\'s fate is less certain in that chamber, where the House Judiciary Committee _ which will consider it _ has been hostile to capital punishment &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; in the past. ``Murder is murder, whether legal or illegal,\\'\\' said Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash. ``We are reducing the civility and the compassion of our society.\\'\\' But Sen. Alfonse D\\'Amato, R-N.Y., the bill\\'s sponsor, said, ``I believe society has a right to say we are outraged at certain acts, and the death penalty is the appropriate penalty in these cases.\\'\\' Before final passage, &lt;b&gt; lawmakers &lt;/b&gt; voted 66-28 to set aside a provision by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., that would have limited the bill\\'s capital punishment provisions to drug dealers who are convicted of killing law enforcement officers. On voice votes, they accepted a provision that would allow prison employees to refuse to participate in executions, and rejected language that would have required prisoners to be killed in public. Both measures were sponsored by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore. On Thursday, the Senate voted 69-27 to shut off debate, ending a filibuster by opponents who had stalled a vote. ``I\\'m not saying the death penalty will eliminate the drug problem, but I do think it will serve as a deterrent,\\'\\' said D\\'Amato. But opponents decried the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; as election-year politics, saying it would do nothing to deter drug dealing and represented a cynical response to public demands to do something about illegal drugs. Evans referred to a similar &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; proposed in 1986 and said: ``Once again, we\\'re going for an election-year slam dunk on drugs. ... We\\'re taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political vanity.\\'\\' The D\\'Amato &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; provides that the death penalty can be imposed on people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring and who are then separately convicted of killing law enforcement officers or private citizens. Many states, including those with severe drug problems, already have the death penalty and it hasn\\'t had much deterrent effect, opponents of the &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; said. Before invoking cloture, the Senate voted 65-31 against an amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment without parole, instead of the death penalty, for people convicted under the terms of D\\'Amato\\'s bill. D\\'Amato\\'s &lt;b&gt; proposal &lt;/b&gt; was originally attached as an amendment to the Pentagon budget bill, but opponents filibustered and D\\'Amato withdrew his &lt;b&gt; proposal &lt;/b&gt; in return for a promise by Senate leaders to give him a &lt;b&gt; vote &lt;/b&gt; on a separate bill. Supporters said the death penalty would deter drug kingpins. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said, ``To go on talking about a war on drugs and not commit ourselves to a death penalty for those who kill our law enforcement officers in that war is to make a mockery of saying we have a war on drugs.\\'\\' But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said, ``The evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent is just not there at all.\\'\\' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., added that the death penalty provision could lead to the execution of innocent people. He cited a Stanford University study which said 350 people have been convicted of capital offenses in this century and then later found to be innocent. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, responded that there are enough safeguards in the legal system to protect innocent persons. ``Nobody should be able to kill our policemen without paying the ultimate price,\\'\\' he said. Also Thursday, the House Banking Committee &lt;b&gt; approved &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; legislation &lt;/b&gt; to make it more difficult for drug dealers and other criminals to hide their profits. The &lt;b&gt; bill &lt;/b&gt; would require banks to file transaction reports with the government for all cashiers\\' checks, money orders and travelers\\' checks of $3,000 or more. Now, banks need to file such reports on transactions of $10,000 or more. New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, meanwhile, was proposing the creation of ``tent jails\\'\\' in Nevada to incarcerate convicted drug offenders and relieve prison overcrowding elsewhere. In an appearance before two House Armed Services subcommittees, Koch conceded that Nevada probably wouldn\\'t think much of his idea. &lt;/p&gt; 0.371477202794283  \\n   The &lt;b&gt; chairman &lt;/b&gt; of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says presidents should be sworn in earlier because the 2{ months between Election Day and Inauguration Day creates an unnecessary ``period of vulnerability.\\'\\' ``The incumbent president no longer has real political authority and the incoming president lacks constitutional authority, and the whole world knows it,\\'\\' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Friday. ``It is a period of vulnerability which can and should be eliminated.\\'\\' In a Senate floor speech introducing a resolution for a constitutional amendment, Pell said the change would eliminate ``10 weeks of crippled leadership\\'\\' and avoid an ``unhealthy and unnecessary situation.\\'\\' The senator wants to move up Inauguration Day for the president and vice president from Jan. 20 to Nov. 20. The constitutional amendment also would move the swearing-in day for Congress from Jan. 3 to Nov. 15. Pell has introduced similar measures in the past. With time quickly running out in this session of Congress, action this &lt;b&gt; year &lt;/b&gt; appears unlikely. From 1793 to 1933, the swearing in of new presidents took place March 4. The 20th Amendment pushed it back to Jan. 20 beginning in 1937. Pell, who introduced the resolution along with Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., said the move also would avoid `@lame duck\\'\\' administrations in which officials might be ``tempted to expend funds, make contracts and grants and promulgate regulations that may be either politically motivated or inspired by sheer self-interest.\\'\\' Pell said the development of voting machines and instant election result tabulations eliminates the justification for the long lag time between elections and inaugurations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  stores store sales food market customers nordstrom goods consumers christmas shopping retail clothing chain bread prices video employees buying department &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.409647116339293  \\n   America\\'s No. 1 &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; is swallowing No. 3 in a $40 million deal that gives Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. a total of more than 1,700 stores. Blockbuster agreed to acquire Erol\\'s Inc. of Springfield, Va., a &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; of 208 outlets that pioneered the &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; rental business in 1980 but has struggled amid management shuffles and stiff competition. The deal ``provides an outstanding opportunity for Blockbuster and its franchise owners to broaden the base of ourstores,\\'\\' Blockbuster chairman and chief executive officer H. Wayne Huizenga said Monday. Erol\\'s, the nation\\'s third-largest &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; behind West Coast-National of Philadelphia, has &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland and Chicago as well as 112 &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in the Washington, D.C., area, where Blockbuster has only 48 outlets and was looking to expand. Blockbuster, based in Fort Lauderdale, opened its 1,500th &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; Monday, in Vancouver, British Columbia. In all, the &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; has &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Canada and England. Erol\\'s founder and principal stockholder, Erol Onaran, said the buyout was in the best interest of his 2,600 employees. ``It was going to be a fight,\\'\\' said analyst Drew Beja at Advest Securities. ``And Blockbuster had the resources to win the fight.\\'\\' Onaron founded Erol\\'s as a stereo repair shop in Washington in 1963. It was an early pioneer in the &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; industry, opening &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; exclusively devoted to rentals in 1980, and led all other &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; chains in revenue until Blockbuster surpassed it in 1988. But Erol\\'s has been stagnating since then, and didn\\'t begin to sell franchises until last August, said Frank Molstad, editor of Video Store magazine. In contrast, Blockbuster has been expanding by 400 to 500 &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; a year since Huizenga bought the company in 1987 for $19 million, and Huizenga has said &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; this year could top $1 billion. Erol\\'s had revenue of $100 million last year, said Jerry Falkner, an analyst at Southwest Research Partners in Boca Raton. While more than 1,700 &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; by the end of the year, Blockbuster will still have only about 10 percent of the home &lt;b&gt; video &lt;/b&gt; market, said Fran Blechman Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt; 0.400430825039905  \\n   Hopes for a successful Christmas &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; season all but vanished after the nation\\'s biggest retailers said their business continued to deteriorate in October. Several companies including Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported Thursday that their &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped from levels of a year earlier as consumers, preoccupied with concerns about the economy and the Middle East, avoided &lt;b&gt; buying &lt;/b&gt; anything they didn\\'t need. The disappointing October &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; followed poor showings in August and September, and with Christmas less than seven weeks away, retailers and the industry analysts who track their performance expect &lt;b&gt; consumers &lt;/b&gt; to remain frugal during the holiday season. ``They\\'ll probaby be going in and &lt;b&gt; buying &lt;/b&gt; the same number of items, but they\\'re not going to pay as much ...\\'\\' said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. ``They\\'re not going to buy $100 electronic toys for their kids, not this year.\\'\\' Analysts said shoppers will be looking harder for bargains and waiting longer for price reductions than in past years. ``They\\'re going to be busy spending fewer dollars,\\'\\' said Daniel Barry, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. Consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait raised the specter of war, inflating &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; of gasoline and home heating oil. The first items crossed off &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; lists were so-called discretionary items - clothing, furniture, home appliances and other extras that are the &lt;b&gt; bread &lt;/b&gt; and butter of many big stores. If retailers have a difficult Christmas, it could contribute to a further deterioration of the economy, since two-thirds of the nation\\'s economic growth is generated by consumer spending. Unsold &lt;b&gt; goods &lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; shelves could also affect manufacturing - if &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; don\\'t place new orders, factories don\\'t need to provide as many products and could lay off workers. And a poor Christmas season could be devastating for the retailers themselves, as they depend on holiday &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; for about half their annual &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; and profits. Christmas 1989 was a disappointment for many storeowners after they were forced to slash &lt;b&gt; prices &lt;/b&gt; to attract customers. Sears, the country\\'s largest retailer, said October results from &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; open at least one year fell 0.4 percent from a year earlier, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 1.2 percent. Analysts believe &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; open at least a year - also known as same-store or comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; - provide a more accurate assessment of a retailer\\'s performance than overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; do. New &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; tend to have extraordinarily strong &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; that can skew a retailer\\'s results. One of the hardest hit last month was Penney, which said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; fell 6.3 percent from October 1989, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 4.9 percent. Limited Inc., the nation\\'s largest specialty apparel retailer, reported comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 1 percent as overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 13 percent. Apparel &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; were also affected by continuing warm weather in some parts of the country. May Department Stores Co., parent of big &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; chains including Lord &amp; Taylor, Hecht\\'s, Filene\\'s and Foley\\'s, said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; dropped 4.4 percent, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; edged up 1.1 percent. But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the biggest discount retailers, continued to outperform the rest of the &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; industry, reporting comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 10 percent while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 25 percent. Analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores, especially those going into the Christmas season with high inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales. These retailers are expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise - and see their profits evaporate. Markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers, having seen one round of price reductions, wait for more merchandise to be marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts. When one retailer lowers prices, it pressures others to follow. Among other reports from retailers Thursday: -Dayton Hudson Corp. said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 4.1 percent, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; picked up 16.7 percent. -Kmart Corp. reported a 1.3 percent &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; gain at comparable stores, and an 11.2 percent rise overall. -Woolworth Corp. said comparable &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; increased 1 percent, while overall &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; rose 4.2 percent. The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; report from the government. The Commerce Department\\'s figures includes &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.381226494643611  \\n   The signs say ``Always Open,\\'\\' but for the first time in 35 years, most of the 1,200 Denny\\'s restaurants across the United States will close their doors for Christmas Day. Locking those doors is a different story. Some buildings have been without locks for decades because of the always-open policy. At others, the locks have never been used and the keys can\\'t be found. The company is having to install locks at about 700 restaurants, said Joe Herrera, director of marketing at the company\\'s southern California headquarters. The company decided to close this year so &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; could have the day off. ``It will cost us about $5 million in sales,\\'\\' Herrera said. The chain\\'s 60,000 &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; were so grateful for the holiday that many sent cards and letters of appreciation to the offices, Herrera said. Employees received normal pay for Christmas Day. ``We just feel we spend 364 days a year taking care of other people\\'s families; for one day a year we want to take care of our own,\\'\\' he said. Nobody wants to work on Christmas, he said, and it has been the top turnover day of the year, with some managers losing four or five employees. In Hollywood, the companywide closing solved manager Almaz Legesse\\'s problem of choosing which &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; of a Sunset Boulevard restaurant to give the day off. ``I had a big list. ... I was having a hard time,\\'\\' she said. The restaurant, which serves more than 1,700 Christmas customers, was awaiting a visit from a locksmith. ``We never had locks,\\'\\' Ms. Legesse said. ``After so many years of working Christmas every year it\\'s real nice,\\'\\' said Lee Sevene, a manager at a Denny\\'s near a turnpike in Portland, Me. ``People have always thanked us a lot for staying open,\\'\\' said Frances Bushman, manager of a Pismo Beach, Calif., Denny\\'s. ``On the other hand they always felt sorry for our waitresses and cooks,\\'\\' she said. Ms. Bushman\\'s Denny\\'s has locks but she had to check to see if the keys fit. Christmases in the past have been about twice as busy as average days at Denny\\'s, Herrera said. ``We have up to an hour wait sometimes on Christmas, and that\\'s all day _ not just at midday,\\'\\' Herrera said. ``It actually starts on Christmas Eve, and just keeps going.\\'\\' The Christmas closing applied to 1,221 restaurants. The operators of 174 franchise restaurants were allowed to make their own decisions. Winifred Gibson, a manager at two Denny\\'s franchise restaurants in Fresno, Calif., said they would remain open for the biggest day of the year. But she sympathized with the trouble of locking up a Denny\\'s. ``Once I needed to lock the doors on my store. It was a major fiasco. It took us a day to find the keys,\\'\\' Ms. Gibson said. Christmas Day used to bring in mostly single people, couples with no children or elderly people with no family, she said. ``But not anymore. You have so many one-parent families.\\'\\' The three franchise Denny\\'s in Anchorage, Alaska, and one in Fairbanks will be open, said Donna Flanagan, manager of an Anchorage restaurant. Ms. Flanagan expects to serve about 1,500 people on Christmas, which is second only to Mother\\'s Day in bringing in customers. &lt;/p&gt; 0.363127625659827  \\n   Travelers on France\\'s superhighways will soon be able to dine on hamburgers at roadside fast-food restaurants. Burger King, in cooperation with the French restaurant and hotel company Elitair, announced plans Wednesday to open the first two fast-food restaurants at rest stops along the national highway network. One will be near Evry, southeast of Paris, on the A-6 highway. The other, a drive-through restaurant, will be near Bordeaux on the A-10 highway. Burger King also said the first fast-food hamburger restaurant at a French airport will open next month in a &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; area at Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris. &lt;/p&gt; 0.362468661632794  \\n   As the trademark piano received a final tuning, &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; help scurried around the new Nordstrom Inc. &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; unpacking the remaining boxes, rearranging clothes racks and getting to know the inventory. The opening of the Nordstrom &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; at the Garden State Plaza &lt;b&gt; shopping &lt;/b&gt; mall in Paramus, N.J., marks the retailer\\'s first foray into the fiercely competitive Northeast. The official debut occurs Friday when the 245,000-square-foot &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; opens for business. Members of the media were given a preview tour of the &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday. Operating in this area might pose the biggest challenge yet for the West Coast &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; that has been migrating eastward as part of an ambitious expansion. A struggling regional economy has shaken consumer confidence and crimped spending. Crisis in the Middle East could further curb &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; spending as the critical holiday season approaches. Nonetheless, Nordstrom executives seem optimistic about entering the &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; and private analysts say the retailer stands a good chance to thrive here. Its service-oriented brand of retailing, combined with broad assortments of reliable quality merchandise, will give it an edge over rivals with less favorable reputations, analysts say. ``I think it\\'s probably one of the best _ if not the best _ &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in the country,\\'\\' said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Management Horizons, the &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; management and &lt;b&gt; market &lt;/b&gt; research division of the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. ``The fact that the competition is in such a state of disarray might make it a good time to go into the Northeast.\\'\\' Richard Pyle, a &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; analyst at Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc., said Nordstrom, which focuses on women\\'s, men\\'s and children\\'s fashions, shoes and accessories, is in far better financial shape than its competitors. Some &lt;b&gt; department &lt;/b&gt; stores, such as Macy\\'s _ which is a Nordstrom neighbor at the Garden State Plaza _ are courting &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; aggressively to boost business and pay off debts. Others, such as Saks Fith Avenue, are adjusting to life under new owners who are closely monitoring bottom lines. The 61-store Nordstrom &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; dates back to 1901 when Swedish immigrant John W. Nordstrom founded a Seattle shoe shop with money made mining gold in Alaska. Nordstrom still emphasizes shoes; the Paramus &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; boasts an inventory of some 70,000 ladies\\' shoes and 30,000 men\\'s. The &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; has historically prided itself on top-notch service and stories abound about its &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; associates going to unusual lengths to please people. ``Nordies\\'\\' have been known to personally deliver merchandise to customers\\' homes and to write thank-you notes to &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; _ typically on their own time. The legendary service has been a key to landing &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; in new markets. As elsewhere, the Paramus &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; employs personal shoppers who will help &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; select apparel, assemble outfits and accessorize. A concierge stationed near the entrance will steer &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; in the right direction and handle special requests. Shoppers have three restaurants to choose from on the store\\'s three levels and a spa offering massages, facials, manicures, pedicures and waxing. James F. Nordstrom, one of three descendents of the founder who currently bear the title co-chairman, said shoppers appreciate being treated well no matter what part of the country they live in. Apart from minor adjustments in merchandise mix, he said there have been no special adaptations made in bringing the Seattle-based retailer east. The &lt;b&gt; chain &lt;/b&gt; already operates two &lt;b&gt; stores &lt;/b&gt; in the Virginia suburbs of Washington and intends to open two more in New Jersey over the next two years, plus one in New York in 1993. Its growth strategy calls for about four openings a year. ``We just think &lt;b&gt; customers &lt;/b&gt; like a lot of selection, good quality and to be treated nicely,\\'\\' he said in a telephone interview from the company\\'s headquarters. One blot on the Nordstrom name appeared earlier this year when the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries, acting after a union complaint, ruled that the company has failed to pay &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; for some of the extras they provide. The agency ordered Nordstrom to properly compensate &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; for work and to pay back wages. Industry analysts say Nordstrom has weathered the bad publicity without much damage to its reputation. A $15 million reserve the company set aside to pay back wage claims should be adequate. James Nordstrom said the labor problems, which have been confined mostly to the Seattle area, haven\\'t impaired the retailer\\'s results. Many &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; have proven their commitment to the company, he said, by paying their own way to transfer to new stores. The Paramus &lt;b&gt; store &lt;/b&gt; will have about 100 &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; associates who have previously worked elsewhere for Nordstrom. An additional 100 managers were transferred by the company, which has a policy of promoting from within. About 900 &lt;b&gt; employees &lt;/b&gt; overall will work at the Garden State Plaza store. Nordstrom\\'s &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; and profits haven\\'t been as impressive lately as they had been in the recent past. Earnings slid 20 percent in the first half of this year to $49 million on &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; of $1.36 billion. That deterioration came after a 7 percent income drop last year to $115 million despite a 14.7 percent &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; gain to $2.7 billion. Nordstrom also has felt the pinch of the currently sluggish &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; climate. Co-chairman Nordstrom said, ``It\\'s fair to say that our planned increase in &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; is greater than the increase we\\'re experiencing.\\'\\' He said the retailer is taking a conservative approach to the coming season and will tighten inventory slightly. If business doesn\\'t measure up chainwide for a prolonged period, Nordstrom may scale back its expansion plans. ``We\\'re not going to leverage ourselves and grow for growth sake,\\'\\' Nordstrom said, noting that some openings may be delayed if necessary. At the Paramus store, &lt;b&gt; retail &lt;/b&gt; analysts say the company is hoping &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; will exceed $100 million in the first year. Nordstrom executives declined to disclose projections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  chrysler thompson ford auto motor corp motors assembly general uaw car cars industry domestic vehicles lee trucks truck vehicle sales &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.47906131784782  \\n   Chrysler Motors Corp. on Tuesday named Thomas Stallkamp chairman and Forest Farmer president of its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary. Stallkamp assumes the title previously held by Bob Lutz, chairman of Acustar and of Chrysler Motors, the automaking arm of Chrysler Corp. Lutz remains chairman of Chrysler Motors and a member of the corporation\\'s board. Stallkamp joined Chrysler Motors in 1980 as a &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; purchasing agent and moved to Acustar last June as vice president for marketing and procurement. Farmer succeeds Lee H. Runk, who resigned Monday to become president of the St. Louis-based Harvard Industries, an &lt;b&gt; auto &lt;/b&gt; parts supplier. Farmer has been with Chrysler for 20 years and has held a number of managerial positions. He most recently was &lt;b&gt; general &lt;/b&gt; plants manager for &lt;b&gt; car &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; truck &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; assembly &lt;/b&gt; operations.

Jim Martin has ordered that Confederate flag bumper plates no longer be sold through privately run businesses that also sell North Carolina license plates and validation stickers. The rebel flag plates had been sold at many of the 125 offices. Martin decided to limit &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; of the plates after being questioned about them last week by a group of black business leaders in Winston-Salem, Division of Motor Vehicles Commissioner William Hiatt said Wednesday. Asked whether the plates being sold at the license plate agencies were in good taste, Martin said, ``Probably not.\\'\\' The &lt;b&gt; motor &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; vehicles &lt;/b&gt; commissioner can cancel a contract with a private license-plate agency with 60 days\\' notice and without reason, Hiatt said.

The eight companies that build passenger &lt;b&gt; vehicles &lt;/b&gt; in the United States sold 198,647 &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; cars &lt;/b&gt; and 112,945 &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; light &lt;b&gt; trucks &lt;/b&gt; in early June, down from 208,699 &lt;b&gt; cars &lt;/b&gt; and 116,000 &lt;b&gt; trucks &lt;/b&gt; a year earlier. Industry analysts said &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; were higher in early June 1987 because a new round of buyer incentives had just been launched. They noted that 1988 spring &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; have held steady and consumer confidence remains strong. Car &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; were down during the period for all &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; makers except Toyota Motor Corp., which was just beginning U.S. production last year, and Mazda Motor Corp., which began U.S. production last September. ``The last 10 days of May were very strong and may have borrowed some &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; that normally would have occurred in the first 10 days of June,\\'\\' said Michael Luckey, president of Luckey Consulting Group in Cresskill, N.J. Luckey predicted &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; will be higher during the rest of the month. ``The consumer remains in a buying mood,\\'\\' he said. General Motors Corp. sold 6.2 percent fewer &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; cars &lt;/b&gt; and 4.5 percent fewer &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; light &lt;b&gt; trucks &lt;/b&gt; than in early June 1987.

Chrysler Corp.\\'s &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; car &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; fell 6.4 percent but its &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; truck &lt;/b&gt; sales, which include the hot-selling Jeep lineup, rose 2 percent from early June 1987. Chrysler\\'s combined &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; sales &lt;/b&gt; were down 2.5 percent from a year earlier. GM, the &lt;b&gt; industry &lt;/b&gt; leader, held 45.6 percent of the combined &lt;b&gt; domestic &lt;/b&gt; market, slightly less than its 46.8 percent share a year ago.

American Honda Motor Co. Inc. said Tuesday that its dealers would replace front wheel hubs free of charge on all 2,032 of the motorcycles sold. This is the first year the model has been produced. Under severe use, one or more of the bolts securing the front brake disc &lt;b&gt; assembly &lt;/b&gt; can loosen, the company said, posing a potential danger of front brake failure. The rear brakes are unaffected and Honda hasn\\'t had any reports of accidents blamed on the defect, the company said.

Mike Venezia, the rider of more than 2,000 winners in more than 21,000 races since 1964, died in the fifth race on Thursday\\'s card, officials said. Robbie Davis, the rider of the other horse, was taken to a hospital for treatment of shock. Venezia\\'s mount, a 3-year-old gelding named Mr. Walter K., was humanely killed. Venezia, 43, was the first jockey killed at a New York Racing Association track since March 29, 1982, when Amado Credidio died after he was thrown over the top of a horse onto the ground and into the path of several other horses in a race at Aqueduct. Venezia\\'s mount broke his right foreleg going down the backstretch of a 1 1-16 mile allowance race. Venezia attempted to pull up the gelding, then went off the horse to his left and fell crosswise on the track, directly in the path of the other horse, Drums in the Night. ``I think he was dead when the (ambulance) technician got to him,\\'\\' Dr. Leo Skolnik, the examining NYRA physician, said. ``He was apparently kicked in the face. He had no pulse, no respiration and his pupils were dilated and fixed. ``I don\\'t see how a fall to the ground could have sustained this kind of injury.\\'\\' The last four races of Thursday\\'s card were canceled. Racing was to resume today and a memorial service was to be held for Venezia, who had planned to retire at the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  news cbs nbc television network abc rating broadcast show ratings cable week series sports season coverage time today abc\\'s olympics &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.712860894989505  \\n   ABC only got a silver in the &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; the first &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; of Winter Olympics coverage, but ABC\\'s ``World News Tonight\\'\\' was golden for the first &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; since August, snapping CBS\\' 20-week win streak. The first two nights of the Olympics, Saturday and Sunday, varied widely in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, but according to ABC averaged higher than the first two nights of the 1984 games. An estimated 25 million viewers saw Sunday night\\'s coverage, featuring pairs figure skating, putting it in the top 10 with a 19.7 &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; and a 30 share. But Saturday\\'s &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; of hockey was in the bottom 10 with a 9.9 &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; and 17 share. The &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are tuned to that program. The first two nights of the 1984 games were a Tuesday and a Wednesday, and had a combined &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 13.8 compared to 15.5 for this year, said ABC. ABC\\'s highest rated &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; wasn\\'t the Olympics, but the conclusion of the two-part miniseries ``Elvis and Me,\\'\\' the highest-rated miniseries so far this season. But NBC handily won the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; ending Feb. 14, with an average prime-time &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 16.2. ABC was second with 14.9. CBS was third with 14.2. After winning 19 of the 21 weeks so far in the season, NBC has an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 16.4, and CBS and ABC are tied with 13.6. The 10 top-rated shows of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``The Cosby Show\\'\\' NBC, ``A Different World\\'\\' NBC, ``Elvis and Me, Part 2\\'\\' ABC, ``Cheers\\'\\' NBC, ``Golden Girls\\'\\' NBC, ``Growing Pains\\'\\' ABC, ``Night Court\\'\\' NBC, ``Who\\'s the Boss?\\'\\' ABC, ``L.A. Law\\'\\' NBC and the Winter Olympics Sunday &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; on ABC. NBC\\'s new ``Sonny Spoon,\\'\\' starring Mario Van Peebles as a chameleon private eye, premiered last Friday with so-so numbers, ranking 49th. The lowest rated shows of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``Our House,\\'\\' Winter Olympics Saturday coverage, ``West 57th,\\'\\' ``The Law and Harry McGraw,\\'\\' ``Decision \\'88 _ The Iowa Caucus,\\'\\' ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\\'\\' ``The Thorns,\\'\\' ``48 Hours in Israel,\\'\\' ``Sledge Hammer!\\'\\' and ``The Charmings.\\'\\' For the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; ending Feb. 12, ABC\\'s ``World News Tonight\\'\\' had an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 11.8 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News\\'\\' had an 11.1 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News\\'\\' had a 10.9 and 19. Network analysts had no immediate explanation for ABC\\'s showing. However, last week\\'s &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; could have been affected by &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; of the Iowa caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential race. ``We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; of Chernobyl, and with live programming like the Iran hearings and political coverage,\\'\\' said ABC News spokeswoman Elise Adde. ABC\\'s prime-time special on Iowa ranked a respectable 44 out of 68. It followed the conclusion of ``Elvis and Me.\\'\\' NBC\\'s Iowa &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; ranked 63rd. CBS delayed its &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; of Iowa until 11:30 p.m. EST, after prime time. The last &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; ABC was first in &lt;b&gt; news &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; was the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; of Aug. 10, 1987. &lt;/p&gt; 0.673209979481173  \\n   It\\'s too early to tell how NBC\\'s 179 hours of prime-time Summer Olympics &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; will score in the ratings, but the first three nights started far off the &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; record set by the 1984 games on ABC. Nevertheless, the first three nights of &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; did land in the top 10 in the Nielsens last week, the final &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; year. Sunday night\\'s Olympics &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; was No. 2 among all prime-time shows, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., with a &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 17.7 and a 30 share. Saturday\\'s &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; came in ninth, with a &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 16.1 and a 31 share. The opening ceremonies Friday ranked 10th, with a 15.2 and 29. The &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; is a percentage of the nation\\'s estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The 1984 games averaged a 23.5 rating. People meters, the new viewer-measuring devices that have shown overall lower numbers for &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; shows, combined with a decline in &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; viewing may contribute to a depression in Olympics &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; this year. The first three nights of the Olympics averaged about a 30 share, somewhat lower than the third of the viewing audience NBC had predicted. NBC analyst Jeff Boehme said it was too early to tell if there\\'s a trend in the Olympics ratings. Monday night\\'s Olympics &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; continued to score disappointingly in the ratings, though it won the night for NBC. The &lt;b&gt; coverage &lt;/b&gt; during prime &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; rated 18.0 with a 28 share. CBS had a 14.5 for the night, and ABC a 12.9. CBS effectively programmed against the Olympics on Sunday night with a repeat of the Valerie Bertinelli movie ``Rockabye\\'\\' that ranked fourth in the Nielsens. CBS also scored with its timely ``48 Hours\\'\\' on the approach of Hurricane Gilbert, getting the highest &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; yet for the weekly &lt;b&gt; news &lt;/b&gt; program. It ranked 12th with a 14.1 &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; and 24 share. NBC won the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; ending Sept. 18 with an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 14.0. CBS and ABC tied with 11.5 each. The &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; marked the 52nd since the 1987-88 fall &lt;b&gt; season &lt;/b&gt; began, so NBC claimed its fourth broadcast-year win in a row with an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 14.5. Although CBS finished third for the regular &lt;b&gt; season &lt;/b&gt; that ended in April, based on yearlong figures, CBS edged ABC for the &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; year with an average &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 12.2 to ABC\\'s 12.1. The top 10 shows last &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``A Different World\\'\\' NBC, ``Summer Olympics _ Sunday\\'\\' NBC, ``The Cosby Show\\'\\' NBC, ``Rockabye\\'\\' CBS, ``Monday Night Football\\'\\' ABC, ``60 Minutes\\'\\' CBS, ``Barbara Walters\\'\\' ABC, ``Murder, She Wrote\\'\\' CBS, ``Summer Olympics _ Saturday\\'\\' and ``Summer Olympics _ Opening\\'\\' NBC. The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; were: ``Live!

The &lt;b&gt; news &lt;/b&gt; race last &lt;b&gt; week &lt;/b&gt; continued to be a virtual dead heat, with less than a point separating the three &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; newscasts. CBS had a 10.8 &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; and 22 share, ABC had 10.3 and 21, and ``NBC Nightly News\\'\\' had a &lt;b&gt; rating &lt;/b&gt; of 10.1 and a 20 share. &lt;/p&gt; 0.621504460950423  \\n   ABC\\'s ``Roseanne\\'\\' edged NBC\\'s ``The Cosby Show\\'\\' as prime-time &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; champ in the just-concluded 1989-1980 season, NBC announced Monday. ABC\\'s Tuesday comedy starring Roseanne Barr averaged a 23.3 rating, two-tenths of a &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; point more than the Bill Cosby family comedy which has been first in the Nielson &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; for the last four seasons. ``The Cosby Show,\\'\\' wound up in second place for the season. Cosby\\'s &lt;b&gt; series &lt;/b&gt; has been on the air for six seasons, and Barr\\'s &lt;b&gt; series &lt;/b&gt; for two. Each &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; point represents 921,000 homes. Final figures for the 30-week season, which ended Sunday, won\\'t be available until Tuesday. But &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; research analysts say that NBC will easily win its fifth consecutive season, with ABC coming in second, and once-dominant CBS in third place for the third straight season. Still awaiting final figures for the last three days of the season, Preston Beckman, NBC vice-president for research, said that NBC thus far had a 14.6 &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; average, ABC a 12.9 and CBS a 12.2 during the season. NBC\\'s &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; are down by nine percent, ABC\\'s are flat, and those of CBS are down by three percent, he said. He cited competition from cable, the fledgling Fox network, and independent stations as factors in the overall &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; drop. However, he attributed 25 percent of NBC\\'s decline to the absence of three &lt;b&gt; sports &lt;/b&gt; events it had in prime &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; during the previous &lt;b&gt; season &lt;/b&gt; _ the Summer Olypmics, the World Series and pro football\\'s Superbowl. &lt;/p&gt; 0.598854649155634  \\n   Two new situation comedies starring Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, respectively, are gone from CBS\\' schedule, the &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; announced Tuesday in a schedule shakeup that dumps two of the three CBS shows produced by Grant Tinker\\'s GTG Entertainment. The network, which has ranked last in the &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; so far this season, said ``Annie McGuire,\\'\\' starring Miss Moore, would have its last &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; in its Wednesday &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; period on Dec. 28, suggesting it might be brought back in the future. But the &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; said ``The Van Dyke Show\\'\\' and ``Raising Miranda,\\'\\' the GTG shows, would have their final broadcasts this month. ``Dirty Dancing,\\'\\' a half-hour &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; based on the hit movie of the same name will go ``on hiatus\\'\\' in January. ``Simon &amp; Simon,\\'\\' the long-running, on-again, off-again detective series, has its last &lt;b&gt; broadcast &lt;/b&gt; in its Saturday &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; period on Dec. 31. CBS left the door open to reviving it yet again. GTG Entertainment was established by former NBC chairman and MTM Productions head Grant Tinker in partnership with Gannett. Tinker founded MTM Productions with his then-wife, Mary Tyler Moore. The third GTG &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; for CBS, the critically praised ``TV101,\\'\\' an hourlong, teen-appeal drama, is being moved next month from its low-rated Tuesday &lt;b&gt; time &lt;/b&gt; slot to Wednesday in place of the Moore and Van Dyke shows. GTG has also not fared well with its only other current TV enterprise, the syndicated newsmagazine &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; ``USA Today: The Television Show,\\'\\' though the company insists it is sticking by that &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; for the long haul. In the most recent &lt;b&gt; ratings &lt;/b&gt; from the A.C. Nielsen Co., ``Annie McGuire\\'\\' and ``The Van Dyke Show\\'\\' were the lowest-rated &lt;b&gt; network &lt;/b&gt; shows of the week. ``Raising Miranda\\'\\' was the third lowest-rated &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; last week. Both ``Annie McGuire\\'\\' and ``The Van Dyke Show\\'\\' had problems from the start. Both pilots were re-shot and the Moore &lt;b&gt; show &lt;/b&gt; was partially recast. They then emerged to almost universally negative reviews, even though their stars are two of the most popular sitcom performers ever. Moore and Van Dyke co-starred in ``The Dick Van Dyke Show\\'\\' in the 1960s, and Moore starred as Mary Richards in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\'\\' in the 1970s. CBS announced that ``Tour of Duty,\\'\\' a Vietnam series, will return to the schedule Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST. ``Dolphin Cove,\\'\\' starring Frank Converse as a dolphin researcher in Australia, will join the schedule in January in place of ``Dirty Dancing\\'\\' and ``Raising Miranda\\'\\' on Saturday night. The Smothers Brothers will also return to the schedule for four shows in January and February. &lt;/p&gt; 0.467084372161384  \\n   President Bush\\'s State of the Union message will be aired live tonight on the major networks.

Some local affiliates of PBS and Univision, a Spanish international network, also will carry the address and response, either live or as a tape-delayed broadcast.

Security Council Resolution 678, passed 12-2 Thursday, which gives Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait or face possible military action by member states: The Security Council, Recalling and reaffirming its resolutions 660 (1990), 661 (1990), 662 (1990), 664 (1990), 665 (1990), 666 (1990), 667 (1990), 669 (1990), 670 (1990), 674 (1990), and 677 (1990). Noting that, despite all efforts by the United Nations, Iraq refuses to comply with its obligation to implement Resolution 660 (1990) and the above subsequent relevant resolutions, in flagrant contempt of the Council, Mindful of its duties and responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security, Determined to secure full compliance with its decisions, Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 1. Demands that Iraq comply fully with Resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and decides, while maintaining all its decisions, to allow Iraq one final opportunity, as a pause of goodwill, to do so; 2. Authorizes member &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; cooperating with the government of Kuwait, unless Iraq on or before 15 January 1991 fully implements, as set forth in paragraph 1 above, the foregoing resolutions, to use all necessary means to uphold and implement Security Council Resolution 660 and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area; 3. Requests all &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; to provide appropriate support for the actions undertaken in pursuance of paragraph 2 of this resolution; 4. Requests the &lt;b&gt; states &lt;/b&gt; concerned to keep the Council regularly informed on the progress of actions undertaken pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this resolution; 5.

The message came after Iraq warned its own people not to hide foreigners or they would face the ``severest punishment.\\'\\' Iraq had threatened earlier to use the trapped foreigners as shields, and today\\'s statement by the official Iraqi News Agency said some had already been scattered at the target sites. The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a spokesman for the Iraqi National Council as saying: ``Iraq\\'s foreign guests have been in fact moved to all vital and military installations. They have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in good physical condition.\\'\\' The three-line dispatch provided no further details, such as how many foreigners had been moved or to what installations. Earlier, President Bush demanded that Iraq release all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, and for the first time he referred to them as hostages. ``There can be little doubt that whatever these innocent citizens are called, they are in fact hostages,\\'\\' he said in a speech to &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; veterans in Baltimore. Also today, two senior U.N. officials headed for Baghdad to urge Iraq to free foreigners held captive in Kuwait and Iraq. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein requested the envoys be sent. In his speech, Bush repeated U.S. demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. He also likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler. An Iraqi official also referred to World War II today, reminding the United States that it had once interned members of its own ethnic Japanese population. ``In response to the official American and Western declarations regarding Iraq\\'s hosting of foreigners ... We would like to recall that America, during World War II, held about 100,000 of its own citizens of Japanese origin in detention camps to avert a potential Japanese attack on its western coast,\\'\\' said the statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. It was attributed to the Speaker of the Iraqi National Council, or parliament, Sadi Mehdi Saleh. The United States, meanwhile, picked up another ally in its military thrust against Iraq with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney\\'s announcement &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that U.S. C-130 cargo transports have begun operating from the United Arab Emirates. Cheney\\'s statement in Abu Dhabi marked an important show of cooperation from a &lt;b&gt; gulf &lt;/b&gt; nation with international efforts to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Also today, OPEC said there was not enough support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider Saudi Arabia\\'s request to boost oil production. A brief statement said OPEC\\'s president would meet with some other oil ministers before the end of the month. Saudi Arabia said Saturday it would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels a day. Iraq said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that diplomats who fail to close their missions in Kuwait by Friday will be treated as any other foreign citizen. But in London, the Foreign office said Britain will attempt to keep an embassy in Kuwait. Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and West Germany said they had no plans to close their missions in Kuwait. The Iraqi radio message, monitored in Nicosia, warned Iraqi citizens against secretly sheltering foreigners to protect them. ``Hosting a foreigner in an Iraqi\\'s place of residence is considered a flagrant violation of the law, for which the severest punishments will be given,\\'\\' it said. It said the law applied ``with (Iraq\\'s) entire administrative border\\'\\' _ apparently including annexed Kuwait. On Sunday, Saddam offered to free foreigners if the United States withdraws its &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; from the Persian Gulf region and guarantees the economic embargo will be lifted. U.S. officials dismissed the offer. He later said he would free citizens of &lt;b&gt; nations &lt;/b&gt; that remain neutral in the conflict, including those of Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Portugal. They account for only about 600 of the 21,000 foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. There was growing international anxiety over the fate of the remaining foreign captives, including 3,000 Americans and 4,000 Britons, held for almost three weeks. Saddam said Sunday Westerners will be held at vital Iraqi installations to deter U.S. attacks on the facilities. ``Our people are seeking to avert a catastrophe,\\'\\' Saddam said, in comments read on Iraqi television. ``The presence of the foreigners with Iraqi families at vital targets might prevent an attack.\\'\\' Iraqi authorities also ordered Westerners in Kuwait to assemble at hotels or face the consequences. In other developments: _The White House said U.S. warships were still ``shadowing\\'\\' two Iraqi tankers, which ignored warning shots fired by the U.S. vessels on Saturday. _U.S. warships off the United Arab Emirates were challenging by radio practically every commercial ship coursing up and down the Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported today. _Iraq said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that Indonesian and some Argentine citizens may leave. _China\\'s official Xinhua News Agency said the first group of 97 Chinese would be evacuated from Iraq today, with Baghdad\\'s help. Also today, 122 Soviet citizens crossed into Jordan, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. _The British Foreign Office said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; that 82 Britons were taken Sunday by Iraqi authorities from a hotel in Kuwait city. A day earlier, 41 British citizens were taken from the Kuwait International hotel. _Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal arrived in Damascus, Syria &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; to discuss the Gulf &lt;b&gt; crisis &lt;/b&gt; with the Syrian leadership. _Two Dutch Navy frigates were leaving &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; for the Persian Gulf to join the multinational force arrayed against Iraq. The air defense frigate Witte de With and the standard frigate Pieter Florisz were to take two weeks to reach the region. _ Greece also said it would send a frigate. _Iraqi soldiers &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; continued their withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing up thousands of battle-hardened &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; to face U.S. forces. Iraq and Iran were also repatriating prisoners from their eight-year war, which effectively ended with a cease-fire in August of 1988. _Iranian newspapers &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; attacked the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. The Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial the United States had virtually annexed Saudi Arabia, just as Iraq did Kuwait. But the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S. military presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. United Arab Emirates, an alliance comprising seven sheikdoms, &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; became the first of the moderate Arab governments in the southern &lt;b&gt; gulf &lt;/b&gt; region to publicly announce overt military cooperation with the United States. On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates announced it would allow the deployment of Arab and ``friendly\\'\\' &lt;b&gt; forces &lt;/b&gt; on its territory as part of multinational efforts to defend the Persian Gulf region. On Saturday night, the U.N. Security Council unanimously demanded that Iraq let all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait leave. CBS News said from Baghdad that 35 Americans, including four women and three children, took refuge at U.S. diplomatic ``quarters\\'\\' in the Iraqi capital Sunday. Asked about the report, a spokesman at the State Department said: ``We can\\'t make a comment on that at this time.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.431678616653974  \\n   Twenty-five Portuguese stone masons returned to their homeland Thursday after Iraqi authorities allowed them to leave Baghdad. The workers finished contracts last week to install marble in a palace for President Saddam Hussein on the banks of the River Tigris in the Iraqi capital. A spokesman for the group, Joao Cacador, said Baghdad authorities granted exit visas to the Portuguese after the Iraqi company supervising work on palace appealed to Saddam\\'s office on their behalf. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, on working visit to Spain, said he was overjoyed to hear the Portuguese men had left Iraq. Iraq has held thousands of foreigners in their country in the aftermath of the Aug. 2 &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; of Kuwait, including Westerners in strategic sites thought to be the targets of a possible U.S. attack. &lt;/p&gt; 0.420465917711322  \\n   The Foreign Ministry said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; Iraq\\'s failure to free 1,000 Soviets could lead to a ``tougher attitude\\'\\' toward Iraq\\'s &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; of Kuwait. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin demanded the immediate release of the Soviets. He also told reporters Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq for four hours &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; to reiterate the demand that Iraq withdraws its &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; from Kuwait. Churkin said Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia would meet with Shevardnadze on Tuesday to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis. He said Iraq agree to allow 1,000 Soviets, mostly contract workers, to leave during November but that only about 350 were permitted to do so. When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there were about 8,000 Soviets, including several hundred military advisers, in Iraq. About 3,000 Soviets, including women and children, were allowed to leave shortly after the &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; and about 1,000 left during September and October. Churkin said Iraq agreed to allow another 1,000 to leave in November, but is not living up to its promise. ``Iraq is not keeping its agreement that our citizens will not be prevented from leaving,\\'\\' he said. ``This is totally abnormal and unacceptable.\\'\\' He added, ``If Iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our citizens to leave, this will complicate the present situation even further and force us to take a tougher attitude.\\'\\' Churkin said that to his knowledge, no Soviets were being detained at potential military targets. ``All (Soviet) nationals are still where they were before the crisis,\\'\\' he said. Iraq has prevented hundreds of foreigners from leaving Iraq and Kuwait since Saddam Hussein\\'s &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; overran the emirate four months ago. It has been slowly releasing some foreigners. &lt;/p&gt; 0.411560921062179  \\n   Iraq said &lt;b&gt; today &lt;/b&gt; it will put President Bush on trial Oct. 15 for ``crimes against the peoples of the world.\\'\\' Iraq first announced its plan to put Bush on trial on Sept. 12, shortly after Western officials suggested Iraqi President Saddam Hussein be tried for crimes against humanity for the use of chemical weapons in 1988 against Iraq\\'s minority Kurdish population. Baghdad accuses Bush of planning a &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; against Iraq, attempting genocide by sponsoring U.N. sanctions on Iraq for its &lt;b&gt; invasion &lt;/b&gt; of Kuwait, and committing aggression against Panama and Grenada, according to Hamid Al-Rawi, chairman of Iraq\\'s bar association and head of a panel preparing for the trial. ``Bush has committed many crimes since he took office as president of the United States and also before that when he was vice president,\\'\\' the English language Baghdad Observer quoted Al-Rawi as saying in today\\'s editions. He was quoted as saying the United States, which has sent more than 150,000 &lt;b&gt; troops &lt;/b&gt; to the Persian Gulf to counter Iraq, had committed ``a crime against peace, punishable by international law.\\'\\' Al-Rawi said the trial would be an ``international process\\'\\' with witnesses from other countries and Arab and non-Arab jurists. It would be conducted on the same basis as the Nuremberg trials of Nazi &lt;b&gt; war &lt;/b&gt; criminals following World War II, he said. Other accusations against Bush include the enforcement by the United States ``of an economic blockade against the people of Iraq with the aim of starving children, women and elderly to death, and also preventing food, medicine and baby milk from reaching the country in violation of the the U.N. charter.\\'\\' ``This is a crime punishable by international conventions which consider this an act of genocide,\\'\\' Al-Rawi was quoted as saying. AlRawi did not say what the punishment might be if Bush is convicted during the three-day trial. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  film art movie arts works artists collection disney films entertainment american sotheby\\'s company stars pictures theaters actors grants auction stolen &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.562245781749375  \\n   Andy Warhol\\'s plastic wristwatches of Fred Flintstone, Judy Jetson and Gumby reached $2,640 in a ``wild\\'\\' bidding war _ $2,590 more than the timepieces cost the late artist in a department store, Sotheby\\'s said. Kitschy collectibles were only some of the objects on sale Wednesday during the fifth day of the 10-day &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; of Warhol\\'s possessions. There was also serious jewelry on the block. American Indian art, including ``no end of turquoise jewelry\\'\\' was to be sold at today\\'s auction, said Diana Brooks, president of Sotheby\\'s North America. So far, Warhol\\'s &lt;b&gt; collection &lt;/b&gt; has fetched $9,072,000, more than twice Sotheby\\'s high estimate of $3,951,000. Only 37 out of some 1,400 lots have not sold, she said. The highest bid Wednesday was $55,000 for a pair of surrealist ear clips by artist Salvador Dali, according to Ms. Brooks. The buyer, a private collector, was not identified. The ear clips, asymmetrical ruby-studded hearts with a honeycomb center set with round diamonds, had a pre-sale estimated value of $10,000 to $15,000. An 18-karat gold, garnet and diamond circular pendant, also by Dali, brought $47,300, Ms. Brooks said. The pendant, estimated at $7,500 to $10,000, depicted the profiles of Tristan and Isolde separated by a chalice. The brightly-colored cartoon watches, made by Lewco, were decorated with raised, full-length figures of Fred and Dino, his pet dinosaur; Judy Jetson standing with hands on hips; and a smiling Gumby. Warhol bought them in 1985 and 1986 at Bloomingdale\\'s, Ms. Brooks said. In their original plastic packaging, the watches bore the original price tags of $20 and $10, she said. ``People were so wild to have the three plastic watches in the sale. They sort of symbolize the sale of the whole &lt;b&gt; collection &lt;/b&gt; _ something people will remember,\\'\\' she said. The pre-sale estimate was $60 to $80 for all three. But in ``wild bidding\\'\\' that came down to a telephone contest between four people, the price climbed to $2,640, Ms. Brooks said. A private collector, who was not identified, won the bidding. Bloomingdale\\'s still sells the watches in some stores, said Miraed Smith, a store spokeswoman. Another wristwatch that did well at the &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; was a stainless steel piece, dated 1948, with a photo image of Gene Autry and signed ``always your pal Gene Autry.\\'\\' Sotheby\\'s estimated it would sell for $50 to $100 but it went for $1,870, Ms. Brooks said. Proceeds from the &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; will benefit the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which will award &lt;b&gt; grants &lt;/b&gt; to cultural institutions in the United States and abroad. Warhol died at age 58 last year. &lt;/p&gt; 0.520168825055959  \\n   Claude Monet\\'s Impressionist painting of his wife in a meadow became the third highest priced work at &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, going for $24.59 million to an anonymous telephone bidder, Sotheby\\'s said. The price for ``Dans La Prairie\\'\\' (``In the Meadow\\'\\') broke the record for a Monet set 24 hours earlier at Christie\\'s, which sold his painting of a blue house for $6.55 million, also to an anonymous telephone bidder. The two sales of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture by the rival firms totaled nearly $123.5 million. Sotheby\\'s also sold a Monet landscape for $2 million and set a record price for Pierre Bonnard, whose painting of a woman in her bath fetched $3.78 million. A picture of two women musicians by Henri Matisse sold for $2.83 million. Only one buyer of &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; realizing more than 1 million pounds ($1.72 million) was identified: Japan\\'s Fujii Gallery paid $2.17 million for Pierre-Auguste Renoir\\'s portrait of a young woman in a yellow hat. ``The picture of his wife was Monet\\'s most important work to appear on the market for 20 years,\\'\\' said Sotheby\\'s expert, Michel Strauss. ``There was ferocious bidding which lasted for five minutes between two people on the telephone and no one in the saleroom appeared to be bidding while it was going on,\\'\\' said Fiona Ford, Sotheby\\'s spokeswoman. Auctioneer Julian Barran opened the bidding at $6.8 million after Sotheby\\'s had estimated the picture to be worth around $10.3 million. The highest &lt;b&gt; auction &lt;/b&gt; prices have been paid for flower paintings by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. His ``Irises\\'\\' sold to an anonymous buyer at Sotheby\\'s in New York last November for $53.9 million. Van Gogh\\'s ``Sunflowers\\'\\' was bought by a Japanese insurance &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; at Christie\\'s in London in March 1987 for $39.85 million. Monet, a Frenchman known as the father of Impressionism and the greatest master of that style, painted his wife in 1876 when they were living at Argenteuil near Paris. The summery picture depicts Camille in a white dress and hat, with a parasol behind her, reading a book as she lies among tall grass and wild flowers. The picture was sold by trustees of the estate of the late David David-Weill, an &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; collector who bought it about 1938 in Paris from the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; dealers, Wildenstein. &lt;/p&gt; 0.479530940677886  \\n   Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday it will prohibit paid screen advertising in all &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; theaters &lt;/b&gt; showing the company\\'s films. The policy will begin in March with Disney\\'s release of the &lt;b&gt; film &lt;/b&gt; ``Pretty Woman.\\'\\' ``Our patrons don\\'t dislike screen advertising, they hate it,\\'\\' said Richard Cook, president of Disney\\'s Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Audiences, he said, ``do not come to experience the mundane. They come to escape it. We must not so insult our paying guests (with commercials) and we won\\'t.\\'\\' Disney plans to enforce the anti-ad policy by revoking a theater\\'s license to show Disney movies if it shows advertisements. Cook said the action was essential to the continued financial health of the exhibition of motion &lt;b&gt; pictures &lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; theaters. ``We have been told repeatedly by moviegoers that they do not want and will not tolerate commercial intrusions in &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; theaters,\\'\\' Cook said in remarks given at the 1990 convention of the National Association of Theater Owners. The Disney announcement was greeted by some groans. A number of theater owners depend on paid advertising to generate extra income. Terry Laughren, president of Screenvision Cinema Network, the nation\\'s leading cinema advertising company, said such advertisements bring theater owners millions of dollars annually. ``It\\'s real money. It\\'s not pocket change,\\'\\' said Laughren, whose &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; has placed ads in about 35 percent of the nation\\'s 17,500 first-run &lt;b&gt; movie &lt;/b&gt; theaters. Cook said Disney won\\'t demand that &lt;b&gt; theaters &lt;/b&gt; break existing contracts with advertisers, but the &lt;b&gt; company &lt;/b&gt; will encourage the theater owners to get out of such contracts. Disney defines screen advertisements as commercials for goods and services projected on the screen in the same theater where Disney &lt;b&gt; films &lt;/b&gt; are shown. Previews of upcoming attractions, slides projected for products during intermission and approved charitable advertisements are not affected by the ban, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt; 0.469867410541381  \\n   Occasionally, an &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; theft reads like the plot from an Ian Fleming thriller in which half-mad billionaires pay slick international thieves to steal famous paintings for their private pleasure. In reality, experts said Monday, most &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; is &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; to earn a quick buck in an international black market that is second in size only to the drug trade. The priceless &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; Sunday from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is too famous to be sold anywhere, raising the spectre that the pieces could be held hostage for ransom for a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; world says the paintings are worth. The true scale of the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; underworld is difficult to gauge, but investigators say &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; thievery is increasing as prices for &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; on the legal market soar. ``There\\'s a lot of it going on,\\'\\' said Robert W. Holmes Jr., a Boston attorney specializing in fine &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; transactions. ``Ninety percent of &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; is never recovered. There\\'s obviously a market there.\\'\\' Rarely, one end of the market is held up by someone who decides to commission the theft of a painting that cannot be legitimately acquired. One such theft occurred in 1983, when thieves stole Italian Renaissance masterpieces, including Raphael\\'s self portrait, from the Hungarian national museum in Budapest. Investigators found that a sophisticated band of Italian &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; thieves, armed with cutting tools and high-tech alarm-busting devices, executed a perfect break-in and vanished with the works. An extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home country before they could get the paintings to Greece where, it was later found, an olive oil baron had paid a handsome sum for the sake of having the &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; hang in his home. ``There aren\\'t many thieves with that sort of expertise,\\'\\' said Robert Volpe, a former New York City police detective who worked on the Hungarian case and is now a private consultant tracing &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; around the world. ``They were capable of stealing anything.\\'\\' But most of the black market in &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; is in lesser-known &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; usually ranging in value from $100,000 to $300,000. Priceless &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; such as the Vermeer taken from the Gardner Museum are simply too famous to be sold anywhere. ``It\\'s incredibly stupid to steal a Vermeer or a Rembrandt,\\'\\' said Steven Keller, a private security consultant who was brought in as security director at The Art Institute of Chicago after a major theft of three &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; there by Cezanne in 1979. ``He (the Gardner thief) has got some things that are too hot to handle,\\'\\' Keller said. Keller said lesser-known &lt;b&gt; works &lt;/b&gt; and prints that could be sold more easily were more valuable to thieves than masterworks that couldn\\'t be fenced. ``You might be able to sell say, a lesser-known American artist\\'s painting in Europe,\\'\\' Keller said. ``It\\'s harder to spot them.\\'\\' Often, thieves who can\\'t sell &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; underground hold it ransom for insurance money, a scenario several investigators and curators said was likely in the Gardner theft. Last year, for instance, thieves stole three paintings by van Gogh, demanded a $2.2 million ransom and returned one of the works. The others were later recovered and four people suspected of the theft were arrested. ``It happens, and it happens frequently,\\'\\' Holmes said. ``But like any hostage situation, it\\'s got to be outside the public eye, so often these cases go unnoticed.\\'\\' Keller, noting the relative worth of the &lt;b&gt; art &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; stolen &lt;/b&gt; from the Gardner Museum, said, ``If I were the thief of the Gardner paintings, I\\'d ship the Vermeer and the Rembrandt back to the museum and go for a ransom on the smaller works.\\'\\' &lt;/p&gt; 0.459234620845154  \\n   Woody Allen has added his next three &lt;b&gt; pictures &lt;/b&gt; to his exclusive agreement with Orion Pictures Corp. as writer, director and producer. He will star in two of the three. Principal photography was recently completed on Allen\\'s ``Alice,\\'\\' which will be released by Orion this fall. Also starring in ``Alice\\'\\' are Alec Baldwin, Blythe Danner, Judy Davis, William Hurt and Cybill Shepherd. The fall will also see the start of the last &lt;b&gt; film &lt;/b&gt; under the existing agreement. The movie, as yet untitled, &lt;b&gt; stars &lt;/b&gt; Allen and Mia Farrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt; \\n&lt;details&gt; \\n \\t\\n                &lt;summary&gt;  police found man death shot night killed authorities men died home officers city victims car day arrested attack shooting killing &lt;/summary&gt; \\n &lt;p&gt; 0.667097771705128  \\n   Gang members thwarted in an attempt to &lt;b&gt; attack &lt;/b&gt; rivals rampaged through the city, &lt;b&gt; killing &lt;/b&gt; one person and wounding up to nine others, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said Monday. The &lt;b&gt; victims &lt;/b&gt; apparently were chosen at random during a four-hour spree of shootings and robberies Sunday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; throughout this central California &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; of 350,000 people, said Sgt. Mike Guthrie. ``There doesn\\'t seem to be any identifiable pattern,\\'\\' Guthrie said. ``I think it was more driving until they saw an opportunity and taking it.\\'\\' Police &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; four boys, ages 14, 15, 16 and 17, and confiscated five guns early Monday. All of those &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; are from Fresno, Guthrie said. Each was charged with one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of armed robbery. Their names were withheld because of their ages. One suspect remained at large and additional charges were pending against the four held, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. Besides the three shotguns, one rifle and a handgun, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; seized crack cocaine from one of the youths, Guthrie said. The rampage began after uniformed &lt;b&gt; officers &lt;/b&gt; patrolled a drug-infested west Fresno neighborhood called ``the U,\\'\\' said Guthrie. Five gang members intended to shoot rivals, but left the area because of the police, Guthrie said. After the fatal &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; downtown, one juvenile left the group, Guthrie said. The other four robbed and &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; people along an eight-mile stretch north to near Fresno State University, then headed back downtown, he said. ``This entire scenario was an afterthought,\\'\\' Guthrie said. The &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; spree was ``unprecedented in our city,\\'\\' he said. ``I can recall nothing of this magnitude ... There very easily could have been half a dozen or more murder victims.\\'\\' Police blamed the juveniles for the &lt;b&gt; killing &lt;/b&gt; of a 47-year-old &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; and shootings that left six other &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; wounded. Two remained hospitalized Monday in serious condition, said Sgt. Dwight Williamson. The others weren\\'t seriously wounded, he said. The victims\\' names were withheld released. Three other people were injured in shootings Sunday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; and investigators were trying to determine whether the same youths were to blame. &lt;/p&gt; 0.619373130670238  \\n   A motorist who was stopped early today on suspicion of drunken driving grabbed an officer\\'s gun, wounding the officer and a second policeman before &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; himself to death, &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; said. Pembina County Sheriff\\'s Deputy Miles Nelson stopped the suspect on a possible charge of driving under the influence shortly after 1 a.m., according to Deputy Cal Cluchie. An ``altercation\\'\\' occurred in which the &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; took Nelson\\'s service handgun and &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; him, Cluchie said. Nelson managed to call for assistance as the &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; fled. Cavalier Police Chief James Johnson, responding to the call, was also wounded as he attempted to stop the man, Cluchie said. The suspect was later &lt;b&gt; found &lt;/b&gt; nearby with a fatal gunshot wound, apparently self-inflicted, he said. Nelson was listed in critical condition at the United Hospital in Grand Forks, and Johnson is listed in stable condition at Pembina County Memorial Hospital. No other details were immediately available. Cavalier is located about 15 miles south of the Canadian border in northeastern North Dakota. &lt;/p&gt; 0.591449050027766  \\n   Four people were fatally &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; and eight wounded in gang-style attacks across Southern California on Halloween and early today, and a 15-month-old boy &lt;b&gt; died &lt;/b&gt; a &lt;b&gt; day &lt;/b&gt; after he was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; in the head outside a birthday party. An unidentified 20-year-old &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; early today while walking on a street in Monrovia, about 15 miles northeast of Los Angeles, sheriff\\'s Deputy Detta Roberts said. A gang connection was being investigated; no arrests were made. In southwest Los Angeles, a 19-year-old &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; reputed to be a gang member was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; late Monday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; when rival gang members ambushed a group of young people as they left a liquor store, officials said. Four people were wounded, one of them critically. The name of the &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; who was &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; was not immediately released, and there were no arrests. In San Diego, two unidentified &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; and three &lt;b&gt; men &lt;/b&gt; wounded in three street shootings Monday night, &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; reported. Dalafayette Polk, the toddler injured in the birthday party &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; Sunday in the Watts section of Los Angeles, &lt;b&gt; died &lt;/b&gt; at 12:30 p.m. Monday, said Paitoon Wisuskeow, a nurse at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. Nine other people were wounded in the &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; Sunday night, one of the worst outbreaks of street violence by youth gangs. Police had made no arrests by early today. In downtown Los Angeles, a 15-year-old identified by &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; as a gang member was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; twice Monday &lt;b&gt; night &lt;/b&gt; by by gang members driving by, said &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; Officer J.R. Smith. The teen-ager was reported in satisfactory condition at California Medical Center today. &lt;/p&gt; 0.583347799642819  \\n   Gang members returning from a friend\\'s funeral allegedly used two rented limousines in a drive-by &lt;b&gt; shooting &lt;/b&gt; that wounded one man, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. The unidentified &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; was treated for a gunshot wound to the foot at Brotman Medical Center in Culver City after the 2:30 p.m. Thursday shooting, Sgt. Bob James said. James said no arrests were made immediately, but the limousines were impounded and the drivers questioned and released. ``These drivers don\\'t know what these people are doing,\\'\\' James said. ``These people are in the back partying. The drivers don\\'t know what\\'s going on.\\'\\' On Tuesday, gang members opened fire from a limousine and &lt;b&gt; killed &lt;/b&gt; 19-year-old Robert Lewis Riley Jr., &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. Both shootings were under investigation. &lt;/p&gt; 0.571094354633758  \\n   At least 100 people, some armed with guns or baseball bats, converged on a low-income neighborhood Tuesday night, apparently to protest &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; handling of a teen-ager\\'s death, &lt;b&gt; authorities &lt;/b&gt; said. Shots were fired, and bottles and bricks were thrown, but no serious injuries were reported in this &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; of nearly 40,000 people on Lake Michigan, &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; said. ``We\\'ve had shots going off all night,\\'\\' said policeman Mike Elkins. `No shots have been fired by us. We\\'re in full riot gear.\\'\\' About 20 people had been &lt;b&gt; arrested &lt;/b&gt; by 10:30 p.m., three hours after the disturbance by at least 100 people began in a four-block section of the neighborhood. State and county &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; and state prison &lt;b&gt; officers &lt;/b&gt; were dispatched to help &lt;b&gt; city &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; control the crowd, Elkins said. ``I know there were problems up there last night,\\'\\' said LaPorte County sheriff\\'s Sgt. Mark Ludlow. ``I don\\'t think its fair to call it a riot, maybe a civil disturbance.\\'\\' There were minor injuries, but it was not immediately known how many people had been hurt, Ludlow said. The disturbance was apparently a protest of the &lt;b&gt; death &lt;/b&gt; late Monday of Chris Crawford, 16, and the wounding of his cousin Michael Cain, 17. Cain, who was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; in the left side, said he and Crawford were standing near a video arcade when they were approached by an unknown &lt;b&gt; man &lt;/b&gt; who fought with them. Cain said his cousin was forced into the street, then hit by a &lt;b&gt; car &lt;/b&gt; and killed. Cain said he was &lt;b&gt; shot &lt;/b&gt; as the vehicle passed. He was taken to Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and released. Residents of the neighborhood, which is near a housing project, said &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; were less responsive to crimes in their area than in more affluent neighborhoods. Police took more than an hour to reach the scene of Monday night\\'s violence, said resident Vince Woodard. ``We called them on 911 and they didn\\'t come,\\'\\' Woodard said. Elkins disputed allegations that &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; were slow to respond Monday. ``I\\'m sure in a case like that we were there right away,\\'\\' he said. The officer said &lt;b&gt; police &lt;/b&gt; dispatchers received the call at 11:39 p.m. and arrived at the scene within a minute. ``We\\'re only a couple of blocks away,\\'\\' Elkins said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt;\"'</span>"
